- Get yourselves familiar with literature (papers, blogs, code repositories) and start already collecting stuff for your report.

- Understand how I go from the pure text to the vector representation

- Think (& see the literature) over necessary pre-processing steps (you can also refer to the data to already see problems that might occur)

- Already come up with basic ideas, approaches, brainstorm ideas, etc.

- Most importantly: Mark everything you think is important and feel free to play around (e.g. by seeing a word2vec model)
