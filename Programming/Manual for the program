How to start the visualisation: 
1. One need to start the mongoDB with the data from the dropbox folder. 
2. One need to start the CoreNLP server. 
3. One need to download the rnn-checkpoint from the dropbox folder and put it in "python/neural_networks/recurrent_neural_network/checkpoints". 
4. One need run a CNN for some time (checkpoint is too big) and link the latest checkpoint folder name in the text_cnn "predict" method. 
5. One need to download the trained glove model from dropbox and put it in "python/pre_trained_embeddings/glove/". 
6. Now all models are present. 
7. Now one need to start the API for the server (Flask) -> "python/api/predict_api.py"
8. Now one can run the "javascript/visualization/index.html" file to open the visualisation. One can now put a facebook post in the textarea (just the plan text).
