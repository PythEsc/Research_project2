I would understand if Tesco put a limit -  lets say of ¬£10 of money spent on shopping before customer is allowed to vote  but encouraging plastic bag purchasing seems wrong!

This evening I received a phone call from  ALRIC  on behalf of Tesco  who advised me there was a problem with my payment.  There was no problem in rectifying this problem  as I was very happy to confirm all details of the payment and correct any errors that had clearly occurred (as the payment had shown cleared on my account the day before). However  throughout the entire telephone conversation  I found  Alric  to be extremely short tempered  abrupt and bordering rude to me.  I found this completely unnecessary as it was obviously a hiccup within the system and  Alric  was not at all representative of the excellent customer service that I would expect from Tesco.  It took a long time for him to explain the situation to me (he went all round the houses with it - confusing himself and me!)  hence it took  longer than it really should have to reach a resolution - an error in the expiry date as it turned out.  He made me feel very negative about a situation that could have been sorted far quicker had he adopted a more positive attitude.

I still spoke to a lovely lady who confirmed that the offer was still on in store and as I would have to travel there by myself with a one year old during rush hour  offered to check the stock for me- there were seven in store. So we travelled to the store  got the three etch a sketches  but as they weren t in the toy aisle I went to customer services to check. The lady searched and came back and said that they were on the tills as stationary and so was not part of the offer. This meant that instead of paying the ¬£24 had I been able to buy them online  I would have to pay ¬£45.

At home I use quorn chicken and make bbq chicken and salad rolls  hullumi and sweet chilli wraps  quorn chicken and sweetcorn rolls; the list is endless. ...however when I m in a rush or fancy a quick fix   I am so sick of the only options for veggies in Tescos ready made sections being something with cheese; cheese and onion  cheese and pickle  cheddar ploughman or egg; egg and cress or egg mayo. The only other option is a falafel wrap which tastes disgusting and on the very very odd occasion a three bean wrap which are not in very often. After 3 years it gets very very boring... Wish supermarkets would realise that we do actually eat other things. I understand Quorn is a product of its own so supermarkets maybe can t use it in their fillings  but the same old cheddar cheese or egg and cress is very old and very bland next to all the exciting new flavours brought out for meat eaters. Even Asda have cottoned on and have at least brought out a veggie sushi which changes things up a little.

What is it with you people and plastic packaging? After an early start with the chores on this beautiful autumn morning  I thought I d take a break from the usual healthy eating and treat myself to a nice thick bacon sandwich. Great I thought  this will hit the spot. That was before I was confronted by a sinister enemy that just wasn t prepared to go down without a fight  the bacon. Now I know I m not exactly built like Arnold Scwarzenegger but I like to think that I m a reasonably strong man and should have no problem opening a packet of bacon  especially when those nice Tesco people have left a convenient little flap on the corner of the packet to be able to peel back the lid. However  this was anything but the case because your suppliers seem to be under the impression that the product shouldn t be just sealed but arc welded too. After the first few attempts just slipped through the fingers (very little purchase on such a small area of plastic). I know  I thought to myself  I ll get my thumbnail under it  that should give me the necessary leverage. CRACK! No it didn t  it just broke my thumbnail. Next it was on to using my teeth (not very hygienic I know but by now desperation is setting in) and more to the point this didn t work either  it just kept slipping through my clenched teeth. By now  even though I m a pretty laid back kind of guy  I m starting to take it personally and finally decided I needed backup  The Knife. I realised immediately that this was too big a job for a simple table knife and was going to require the stabbing skills of a pointed knife  preferably with a serrated edge. So  armed with my favourite 6 inch blade I set off on my latest mission. Approaching the packet of bacon for the umpteenth time  like a marine storming a foreign beach in wartime I was filled with adrenalin and a mixture of excitement  fear  anger and bravado. I even said to the pack  let s see what you ve got. This time it s just you  me and the knife . It s at this point I finally lost the war and my appetite for bacon  because the knife decided to defect to the other side by refusing to pierce the film but slide off of it and stab my other hand instead. This isn t the first time I ve had to do battle with a packet of bacon but if a hospital trip is the price of a bacon sandwich it sure will be the last.;;;;;2016-10-31T11:58:10+0000;1477915090;2016-10-31 12:58:10;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

First we received this message   Thank you for your message  I have checked the progress of your repair and can confirm that unfortunately your item was found to be beyond economic repair.   As this item is over 3 years of age due to depreciation there is no residual value left to refund.   This item has now been put through our internal recycling process on your behalf.   If we can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact us.   Kind regards   Chris   Customer Service Representative  Tesco Outlet  Since the television had only been used for about 2 hours a week  we asked for a partial refund. We received this reply from you   Thank you for your message   As your product was was out of warranty what the issue was reported to us on the 20.9.16  however in line with your consumer rights we offered to return your item for possible repair. Unfortunately due to the age of the system replacement components had become obsolete and and therfore rendered the unit beyond economic repair.    As the item exceeds three years of age we contest that this item had any intrinsic fault  as such faults normally found within the first six months of usage. In addition with regards to any information provided to the amount of usage as this can not be substantiated it is nothing more than hearsay and superfluous to our decision.   This decision is final and we are not prepared to enter into any discussion with regards to a compensation claim.   Kind regards   Chris ‚Äã  Customer Service Representative  Tesco Outlet  I don t accept that 200 hours of use is an acceptable length of service for a television. Clearly it was designed badly or it was made badly.   Are you really not willing even to entertain any responsibility for selling this item?

Times must be hard for Tesco these days as none of these offers apply any longer other than the ¬£6 a month delivery saver and even at that you have to spend ¬£40 now. Which means if your driver forgets to give you half of your shopping and leaves you with 3 half dinners (like what happened to me on Saturday) and you have to reorder the stuff  you have to order a load of stuff you don t need just to meet the minimum delivery. No money off vouchers any more  no clubcard boost  no petrol discounts. Nothing. Not much reason to be loyal to Tesco any more. This comes from someone who posted on your wall a year ago saying how good it was to be a Tesco customer. Not feeling loved any more Tesco.

I paid the full amount for the four items and was told it could be more easily sorted out at customer services. I went to customer services where the assistant asked if I was sure I had actually picked the items from the ¬£10 Meal Deal display? Where the Hell did she think I d got them from? There was not enough staff to check if I had indeed picked up the correct combination for a Meal Deal so she offered me a refund on the said items. I suspect the culprit was the wine  it usually is. I m not sure of the intelligence level of your shelf fillers but I can tell you this isn t the first time it has happened. I felt cheated and annoyed as I left the store and I also  more importantly  didn t feel valued as a customer. In fact I felt as if my honesty had been doubted too. Perhaps  instead of encouraging your staff to wear amusing Hallowe en costumes you could teach them a bit more about customer service and courtesy though to be honest more staff would be more of a help.

He came back to it the other morning after popping in to get some items for lunch at work and found a parking charge notice for ¬£100 stuck to it.  We watched the Arena store being built as we live about a 7 minute wall from Tesco s doors.  We as a family have used this store for our weekly shopping  our petrol and as a  corner store  as we live so close to it and can use it when we need one-off or essential items at various times of the day/night. Although it is a very large shop  because we use it so often we get to know some of the staff and value that personal welcome that you miss in some of the larger stores. However  to now be  fined  for parking his scooter where he has parked for years (and not in anyones way) is just a kick in the teeth from Tesco Management.  Tesco Management must value the income from these car parking companies but this ticket was unfair as my husband parked near to some support pillars (but out of everyone s way so as not to cause an obstruction) to protect his scooter from the car drivers who reverse into your motorbike or scooter and then drive off. Believe me it happens! I am so sad that it has come to this from a shop we enjoyed using.;;;;;2016-10-31T10:28:47+0000;1477909727;2016-10-31 11:28:47;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I went in looking for a micro hdmi cable and the shop was getting a refit by the looks of it. So I can understand staff may be harassed but it was not busy. I asked politely for help so not to go near the workmen and I got a sigh when I asked about the cable and got a very blunt aw we will never find it in there. Woman went off and came back and said we don t know as it could be anywhere. So left empty handed felt like I was made to feel like I had inconvenienced her. I feel if you are that harassed and can t be bothered to look for stock maybe you should close a shop for an hour or two during a refit. Sorry Tesco I shop here and I am a regular customer but left feeling very dissatisfied with the lack of customer service in store.

I understand there has been done improvements made but some just appear stupid.   1. the trolley shelters in the car park were all ripped out to make way for new ones fair enough they look nicer but why were they not put on the purpose laid concrete pads that the old ones were on ? They have all been put 2 spaces away.  2. Having revamped the bakery in the same store it now seems that to get a fresh in store loaf we must now choose a loaf that is no longer per wrapped in perforated plastic as it has been for many many years. And now must choose a loaf that has already had many other customers hands all over it and put in a bag ourselves. Then fight with the self service checkout to find the item rather than just scan it.  3. Now the aisle markers have been moved to the end of the aisles there is a lot less info on them.  4. Cigarette/lotto/click&collect/customer service counter. There now appears to be too many things going on at this counter and no logical queing for each part causing long delays to anyone using the services offered there;;;;;2016-10-30T20:08:25+0000;1477858105;2016-10-30 21:08:25;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

When it s warm and spread with Lurpak it s the perfect partner to your equally fab tortellini (and frequently the reason why my fianc√© and I fail our low carb diets!)

Added to basket with the pasta and thinking  the diet can start again tomorrow . I got home to find a second Three Cheese Bloomer in my kitchen that my fianc√© had purchased from the same store earlier in the day (great minds think alike and it s our favourite bread!) Only later on when I cut into a load did I realise there was NO CHEESE! üò± I cut into the second loaf and alas that too was totally cheese-less. I double checked the packaging to make sure we d picked up the right products but they were both definitely packaged as Three Cheese Bloomers (photos in comments) I think somebody in your bakery/packaging department may have made a tiny mistake and used a Three Cheese Bloomer wrapper for a boring regular White Bloomer (I cannot stress the disappointment this causes to cheese fans...) We ate the bread with the pasta as planned and it didn t ruin our weekend but I am confused. Is this a sign from the Gods telling me to stick to a low carb diet?

We have visited Tesco on multiple occasions (2 different local stores) in the past weeks and to describe the trip as frustrating would be an understatement. My grandmother uses a wheelchair  which I push around. Accordingly  we use the adapted trolleys available at your stores which attach to the wheelchair. The problem does not lie in attaching the trolley to the wheelchair but in maneuvering the trolley around the store.  Whenever we attempt to reverse the trolley the wheels hit the front of the wheelchair or my grandmothers foot/ankle. After this it is a nightmare to free the wheel of the trolley which becomes stuck and immobile behind the front of the wheelchair. During our most recent visit  we had to ask for the help of an employee who could do nothing more than kick the wheel of the trolley until it became free and mobile again. In addition  on the same trip we became stuck in front of the checkouts and a fellow shopper had to help us free the wheel. Sometimes we can be stuck in this position for many minutes and not only does it delay us but it can also be embarrassing. This is especially so for my grandmother who is trying to regain mobility and does not wish to draw attention to herself in the wheelchair as it is  despite the fact that I am constantly reminding her in the modern world there should be no accessibility problems.  I am sure we cannot be the only people who are inconvenienced in such a manner and  if we are honest  it puts us off returning to your stores despite the fact that my grandmother has been a clubcard holder for years.;;;;;2016-10-30T12:56:12+0000;1477832172;2016-10-30 13:56:12;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

(Don t usually take them out at night but have been at a party) we bought teething crystals  dummies  (for my 6 month old baby girl) rabbit food and a bottle of water for my son. And when we arrived at our check we found a checkier asleep  after waking her we paid for our items and got cash back and proceeded to leave the store... upon doing so we got stopped by said cashier and another member of staff only to be accused of stealing products that were already under our pushchair from the party that we had earlier been too. Just because we have 4 children I felt like we were steriotyped. My husband and myself work very hard to support our family and to be shouted at and embarrassed in front of our children and other customers is humiliating... we shall think twice before we choose to shop in tesco again. I cannot believe the lack of professionalism and the awful way that we were treated.;;;;;2016-10-29T21:25:13+0000;1477776313;2016-10-29 23:25:13;0;15;0;0;15;15;6;9;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I booked home delivery today for the 4.00-5.00pm slot... at 9.35pm it still hasn t arrived and no-one can tell us why.  Apparently  neither the driver nor the store are answering their phones for the last 4+ hours.  Surely that s a bit of a health and safety concern?!  Plus  I just got an email stating that my original order for ¬£177  will now cost ¬£211!!!  Seriously?!?  What part of this complete debacle is good customer service? I d love an explanation as I m at a loss for any rational explanation.  This does remind me why I haven t done a Tesco home delivery order in 11 months  as this is very similar to what happened last time.

I am a regular shopper in your store and have been looking out for a product on offer in your electrical department which has been out of stock. Tonight around 6.10pm I visited your store to see if the product was in stock. After waiting for 15minutes in a queue at the electrical desk (where no one appeared) I left to do some shopping. I popped back to the (still empty) desk for another 5 minutes before I decided to pay at the checkouts. On my way to the electrical desk for a third time I approached the Customer Service desk to ask if there was someone available at electrics. The lady said there was a member of staff but that they were also covering fireworks. I asked the man if he was available and he asked me to wait again at the desk. After waiting a further 15mins I approached the customer service desk again where I was simply told no one was available to help me  not even to tell me whether the products were in stock let alone serve me. I think it s very poor service that despite being in your store for 45 mins and approaching 2 different members of staff no one was available to assist me. I could not wait any longer and so left your store feeling very disappointed.  Perhaps you should consider the allocation of staff in each department.;;;;;2016-10-29T20:36:51+0000;1477773411;2016-10-29 22:36:51;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We popped in to Tesco to see if we could spot a nice Christmas present for my daughter  and we did.  Two nice presents in fact.  And a fantastic looking Hot Wheels Advent calendar.  I agreed to get it  as it was part of the 3 for 2 offer on toys.  Unfortunately the Take n Play Thomas set wouldn t scan on our scanner  so when we got to the checkout we pressed the button to ask for assistance.  The assistance we got was very limited.  We were told that as the item didn t scan  then they couldn t sell it to us  but he did call over another assistant to try and help us.  The second assistant said exactly the same as the first  and the toy was taken away and put in a trolley with other items that were destined to go back on the shelves (I hope it wasn t put back on the shelf to disappoint another small child).  I explained to the assistant that we were getting three toys because of the 3 for 2 offer and asked what he could do to help us in this situation.  He repeated that he couldn t sell me the item  as it didn t scan in  and then wandered off to help another shopper. In the end we left without any of the toys  much to the disappointment of my five year old. There was no offer to try and help resolve things  just an insistence that I couldn t be sold the item.  Having worked in retail  I know that it is perfectly possible to resolve a situation like this to everyone s satisfaction. Please can you double check that items scan  before they go on the shelf  so that you don t get any more upset children who had been looking forward to getting their sister a lovely Christmas present.;;;;;2016-10-29T19:22:46+0000;1477768966;2016-10-29 21:22:46;0;10;1;0;11;10;2;8;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0

My son in particular is tricky  being intolerant to wheat  dairy  soya and sesame (so far!) and our food journey with him has been a real challenge. We have shopped with you for years and have watched your free-from selection grow and develop which has helped us enormously. Recently I tweeted your customer services team wondering if there was any chance you could start stocking a particular brand of coconut yoghurts that we had only been able to find at an online rival that were the only brand our son liked as they weren t solid and very rich like other coconut yoghurts. For a child the other brands are too much to take  whereas one we found was more like regular yoghurts in consistency and flavour and he loved them. Jake from the team replied promptly and said he had logged it on the internal system so hopefully they d consider it. I walked into Tescos on Winwick Road in Warrington yesterday (which already has a fab selection for us) to find the fridge free-from selection massively expanded and the yoghurts I had requested sat on the shelf! Was absolutely over the moon  bought a tonne of them amongst other interesting new things we found in the section and had a very happy baby! Thank you so much for listening to your customers and making our lives as parents so much easier. And thank you from our happy children who can enjoy the same things as their friends.;;;;;2016-10-29T17:52:57+0000;1477763577;2016-10-29 19:52:57;5;3;6;0;9;3;2;1;3;0;5;1;0;0;0;0;0

He then followed us around the shop as we went and purchased fresh meat and spent more money. Once we had paid he then went and stood in the doorway and blatantly looked under the buggy and gave us a funny look so I said  everything alright mate?  And he said  yeah and you?  Then went back into the store. He blatantly judged us because were young and have a pram. He doesnt know us at all  we spent a lot of money just then and do so every week and im sorry but idiots like that make us not want to even shop in the store anymore.

I ve told the manager about this and swift action should be taken to ensure this is ceased. It may be a difficult task to undertake though.

Tesco wouldnt accept any responsibility for selling it as they insist on a Repair Report from Apple and only Apple which they know customers cannot get.

We have been buying Morrisons and sainsbury nappies for using in the car and reusables at home  more recently we ve been using disposables more frequently   we ve never had any problems until recently when we thought we d try Tesco nappies! I ve not been impressed because every night despite changing her we have had leaks and had to use reusables instead. But never did I expect these disposables to be a danger to my daughter.  My poor 3 month old has been miserable all afternoon  apart from a brief while when she had some nappy free time and then we went for a walk and she had a nap. Ive just changed her nappy again to get her ready for bed and I ve noticed a tiny cut where the nappy sits. It looks like a paper cut caused by the nappy. My poor baby has been cut by one of these horrendous nappies. I am extremely unhappy and so is my daughter.

Please explain to me how it is that I am being told by my local store that all the things I am looking to buy are no longer available  or out of stock. If there is so little demand  then how is it that items you do stock have always run out.  It is a no win situation.  If you stock items we all want and we buy them  then they run out.  If you stock items we want but nobody else does  then there is plenty of availability but no demand  so you discontinue them.  Maybe you would have more space in your store for things we want if you waited until closer to Christmas before stocking your shelves with chocolate Santa  mince pies and festive fare.  Wouldn t.t get that at Sainsburys.;;;;;2016-10-28T19:34:07+0000;1477683247;2016-10-28 21:34:07;0;6;0;0;6;6;3;3;7;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The checkout assistant took them out of the bag and weighed the parsnips at full price and then the carrots. so I said  no they are scary veg.  what?  so I repeated it. she looked at me in that  should I call Security  way. So I quickly explained that Tesco was selling what they called scary veg at 30p per 5 items and it said so on the stand. She knew nothing about it and called a supervisor who also knew nothing about it. They eventually let me have my 5 items for 30p but it made me feel really uncomfortable.

As I was in the wine aisle looking at products one of your employees bumped into me with a shopping delivery cart and didn t acknowledge me at all. I moved along out the way of him and then had to physically jump back out of the way as he nearly did it again. I decided to curtail my shopping and went to pay at a self service checkout. The till didn t acknowledge my clubcard so I went to the customer service desk where I was completely ignored for over seven minutes at which point I decided to leave the store.;;;;;2016-10-28T10:50:53+0000;1477651853;2016-10-28 12:50:53;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Noticed some lovely new products in my local store on Tuesday  lovely lasagne  pizza etc  but alas all gluten and wheat free but milk galore. Why is this? You have started selling white sauce  and you already sell dairy free cheese  therefore you must be able to assemble a lasagne or pizza that is dairy free along with wheat and gluten.

Currently people can buy directly from the FARM and raw milk is not dangerous as many people like to think it has stringent production and regular visits from the authorities to make sure standards of hygiene and production are kept high and to the standard required.  Raw milk is a superior product to pasteurised and in fact a health product  but pasteurisations damages the protein in milk and actually makes it a non health product.;;;;;2016-10-28T09:44:59+0000;1477647899;2016-10-28 11:44:59;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Today I visited my local store in Whiteley with my daughter who was celebrating her 15th birthday. We came to pick up a cake for her. She was wearing a birthday badge and when we arrived in store we were greeted by the most wonderful man Ola.  He wished her happy birthday and sang to her then later on as we were leaving to go home he did something truly amazing. He gave her a card and some chocolates and spoke to her about her dreams for the future and that she can achieve anything she sets her mind too if her heart desires. Now Ola didn t know that my daughter has additional needs and he didn t know that she s been struggling with life recently and what decisions to make for the future. But after her chat with your wonderful member of staff she told me that she felt better about her future and she smiled and laughed the rest of the day. A simple act of pure kindness has done so much and I don t know how I can thank this guy enough for what he did today. He is truly one of life s special gems and he needs to be recognised for this. Please give him a big pat on the back Tesco he so deserves it.

But in that moment I just wanted to tell you not to come.  I had no choice however as despite the fact you could contact me I had no way of responding to your texts.  Eventually the shopping arrived at 9.50.  My feedback would be this: if you can t make the time I ve booked please let me cancel. If this was a day time slot we may not have been in if you were late.

I was supposed to receive my delivery between 4-5pm today. When it didn t arrive  I called at 5pm and after speaking to a lovely customer services rep  being put on hold and then being called back I was informed that the driver who was supposed to deliver my order didn t come into work today and it had been put on another van  but they didn t know which one or what time it would arrive. At 7.45pm I was pretty fed up  I spoke to another lovely customer services rep and was on hold for about 15 minutes while she tried to sort it out for me. She said she had spoken to four different people in the store and nobody could give her any answers and I was told to call back at nine so that we could take this further (her words). I called again at 9pm and after waiting 10 minutes for someone to pick up (a third friendly customer services rep) I was told that I would be called back within 20 minutes so that I didn t have to stay on hold and listen to your horrible hold music (his words not mine)  but I haven t been called back. I don t know about you guys  but I can t just relax thinking that my delivery with tomorrow s dinner  that I need to put in the slow cooker in the morning before my little boy wakes up  I had plans for this evening  but I just seem to be sitting here aimlessly waiting for a delivery that I think won t turn up before hell freezes over. I ll call back at 10pm if this friendly sounding  but not very efficient  as he hasn t called back  customer services rep will call me with an answer.;;;;;2016-10-27T20:42:56+0000;1477600976;2016-10-27 22:42:56;0;20;0;0;20;20;5;15;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Two members of staff then checked the stock room   and advised that this particular store are no longer stocking them  but was told I could make a request at customer services to try and get them back in. I spoke to customer services who located the manager  who proceeded to tell me that this store will no longer be stocking the requested brand of crisps as they are not making enough money on this particular brand.  Clearly it all comes down to profits instead of catering for every individuals needs  this is complete discrimination. This is not the first time I have contacted Tescos to complain or make a request for gluten free foods to be available. Sadly Tescos you have lost a customer after 20+ years of shopping with you  and I will be making the fact profits come before needs to all the gluten free /coeliac groups available.;;;;;2016-10-27T19:03:42+0000;1477595022;2016-10-27 21:03:42;9;4;16;1;21;3;1;2;0;0;9;0;0;0;0;7;0

He made a difference to my day today and i just want him to know he is doing a good job.

When I rang to clarify this I was told the October s payment was a few days late and the early payment was classed as an early payment. I have been charged for making the payment early. How crazy is this? To charge a good customer for over paying. I will not be using the card again  or any of your banking services.

I purchased an iPad 2 yrs ago - the Home button broke so I took it back and said that I would have expected a more robust manufacture of a key component and that 2yrs is not Fit and Proper.  I was advised by the young man  in a very aggressive tone  that I was using the incorrect terminology and that when purchased the item was Fit for Purpose.  He would advise what he needed to help me further.  Did I have till receipt: no but I have the Interest Free Credit Agreement.  Thats no good - Did I have proof of purchase like bank statement - well yes.  Could he have the last 4 digits of the DD.  No I didnt have it with me - to this he said - again aggressively - but you told me you did.  No I didnt say with me didnt think I would need all that.  Then he said he would need a full written Repair Report from Apple.  I had already explained that I had been through to Apple Help and their advice was that they do not repair iPads merely recycle but would exchange mine for a like for like at a cost of ¬£180.  I reminded the young man of this and he said that in order for him to help he had to have a repair report from Apple.  So the upshot of this story is that where Apple and TESCO are concerned you dont really have any recourse for complaint.  TESCO have now lost one loyal customer - disgusted;;;;;2016-10-27T11:36:47+0000;1477568207;2016-10-27 13:36:47;0;12;0;0;12;12;3;9;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My mum is a regular user of your Callington store and often has my little brother  who is 12  with her.  She has mentioned to me that the store intends to employ parking attendants to patrol the car park. Part of the rules they will enforce is that in order to use the parent and child parking area she will have to be issued with a  ticket or badge  to be displayed when parked in a bay - it s a fantastic idea as these are commonly used by people without children and can only be used until the children are 12 years old.  Usually this would be perfectly acceptable  however my brother is autistic. He quite often forgets where he is and the kind of safety advice that most of us follow without a second thought - such as not running into the road without looking.  Not to mention should a melt-down happen. He will either walk or run away  sometimes with his eyes closed.  As he is fully mobile  he isn t entitled to a disabled parking badge.  As you can imagine  the parent and child parking area is a great help to my mum and brother  especially as 99% of the time she is on her own with him.   I was wondering whether you knew if there was a way we could get a permit for my brother despite the age-related rules  or whether this will be a blanket age limit with no exceptions?   Thank you for your time :);;;;;2016-10-27T09:39:48+0000;1477561188;2016-10-27 11:39:48;1;6;1;0;7;6;3;3;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Launceston is an ever expanding town that needs this service available in all locations possible for those who are elderly  disabled and/or have children. I personally have two young children(1&3)  my nearest shop is tesco at half a mile away. The nearest place I can top up my electric key is in town which is over a mile. I do not drive and it is an incredibly long walk for my eldest just to get electric. I also know that the estate I live on is densely populated with families and elderly people and the street I live on has more than one disabled occupant alone. Launceston Tesco is the first supermarket I have come across that does not offer this service.

Your interest is self interest  you certainly don t have the best interests of this country at heart. You are no doubt a remoaner who does not respect the democratic vote that took place on the 23rd June.  You should be ashamed of yourself !;;;;;2016-10-26T09:01:21+0000;1477472481;2016-10-26 11:01:21;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Today my daughter and I visited to do a bit of quick shopping for dinner  my daughter was dancing around and tripped over my feet and fell face first into one of the fridges. We were in the corner of the store but a young man (one of your staff) literally dropped what he was doing to get a first aider and some ice for my crying 3yo. He returned and he and the first aider stayed with me to help calm my daughter and get her back on her feet. I m so grateful for their help  as any mother will agree to  the crys of your child in pain can bring you close to tears yourself and these two wonderful members of your company helped me not to break down in front of my daughter and helped her to bounce back. So thank you and I m sorry I didn t get these people s names. But they were fabulous.;;;;;2016-10-25T13:29:56+0000;1477402196;2016-10-25 15:29:56;8;3;8;0;11;3;1;2;0;0;8;0;0;0;0;0;0

I purchase a lot of products from Tesco and Tesco direct and have recommended it to a lot of my friends and family.   Unfortunately I will no longer be using Tesco services as I have received some bad service the last few times of using them.   Few months back I ordered a laptop through Tesco as I needed one urgently and they promised me that if I order before 3pm I can collect from my local store the next day. I was let down by this as the laptop didn t arrive and I had to wait for a week to get the laptop. They gave me ¬£6 compensation. Which I guess is something.   I decided to still shop with them. I wanted to order a iPhone 7 sim free this week as it s 20% off for staff and my dad works for them. They didn t have the 128gb black in stock so I spent a little more money and purchased the 256gb black one. As it said it was in stock. I went through with the transaction  they took my money within minutes. I then purchased a new SIM card with my network and bought the case for the new phone etc. The next day I receive a email from Tesco direct saying that they made a mistake and that I will not be getting the phone and will be refunded.   I am extremely disappointed as this is the second time of being let down by Tesco. Also they have now got my money in which I won t receive for 3-5 working days. Meaning I can t even purchase a phone from somewhere else as I don t have the funds to do so.   When calling them. They had not offered me anything in compensation seeing as it is their mistake in the first place.  I feel as if Tesco has purposely taken the stock off there website due to the 20% discount. When I check the day night before 20% started they were all available. Yet within the night they had all gone.   I feel as if as it s Tesco fault that they should allow me to purchase the phone at the price it is when I went through with the transaction. As it clearly was in stock otherwise it wouldn t have completed the transaction and taken my money so fast.   I will be making a formal complaint if the matter isn t resolved;;;;;2016-10-25T10:58:49+0000;1477393129;2016-10-25 12:58:49;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My experience of buying a PC online which after 14months is unrepairable and being offered less than half its value does not feel like trying hard ! Being told that the matrix applied makes it uneconomical (for Tesco ) to give me anything approaching the refund I should be or replace it . SO BEWARE if you buy a PC from Tesco don t expect it to last more than 2years. Don t expect customer service just expect to be fobbed off. We treat people how they want to be treated . Joke number 2 I have made countless phone calls to get nowhere. No one listens just repeat policy as if it s a solution for me !! Customers want outcomes not to know why Tesco do what they do. It must have taken much more time and trouble to deal with this stupid situation in a prolonged manner than it would have cost to sort it fairly. I am getting Barclaycard to contest it and liaising with Consumer Rights . I will keep going until I get some justice but NO this is NOT how I want to be treated . When something goes wrong I want ownership of the problem and swift restitution. I am the one who has had no PC for months . My last one incidentally from Curry s lasted 10years !!! DONT buy from Tesco I won t because every little doesn t help me ! I can t do anything with the peanuts you are offering me back. You try to take every little you can from people. It will cost you what you make out of selling me a substandard product and refusing to put things right as I will not shop in Tesco at all because of this Food clothes anything . Not that you care !!

However I m really unhappy at the tendency of this store to remove popular selling products; such as Udi s Tiger Loaf as an example. They are then replaced with Tesco s own version of free from breads and products.  Due to levels of sensitivity and variance  many coeliac and gluten free people find a brand or make of bread that suits them and stick to it. This isn t easily reproduced by another manufacturer  particularly a non specialist branching out into perhaps a lucrative but incredibly nuanced area. Some of us react or experience adverse reactions to certain types of gluten free products  for some reason  and we learn what works.   It s particularly galling when it is a popular product that is then phased out and remains unstocked - only to be replaced by an alternative supermarket version and to take away consumer choice by not stocking the original.   Please can you address this insidious policy of replacing reputable gluten free food manufacturers with own brand free from products- or at least stock both so that consumers are given the best choice. At least then your customers are still purchasing from you. Currently  even though I am about two minutes away from our Tesco Extra  I will now be taking my custom elsewhere due to the fact your bread is unsuitable for my needs.   Many Thanks.   #coeliacuk #udi #coeliac #glutenfree #freefrom";;;;;2016-10-24T11:10:02+0000;1477307402;2016-10-24 13:10:02;11;7;11;3;21;7;5;2;10;0;11;0;0;0;0;0;0

We used to grow hyacinth and make shoe boxes full of festive cheer and staples to help when the need for heating was stronger than the need for food.  Now as an adult I would like to continue this age old tradition and I am now looking for some help to give as many elderly people in my local area a little bit of ease and maybe for a minute forget the worry of food and heating costs. Would you be willing to support my cause and be able to pledge some help towards the people who grew us and our country and now need us to make their lives just that little bit easier.;;;;;2016-10-23T21:45:54+0000;1477259154;2016-10-23 23:45:54;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Upon looking for mozzarella dippers in almost every aisle we found ourselves amongst your frozen goods - we met John next to the party food - he was dressed in his Tesco uniform and his trolley had approximately 48 beers in! I proceeded to ask John. John looked approachable like he would a man that you could rely on for your food needs....  Excuse me please  but where would I find your mozzarella dippers.  I directed at John with a huge smile his reply.  I have no idea.  To which he proceeded to walk off in the opposite direction.  I looked at my driving companion scared that we may have to head further in her car to find our mozzarella dippers. She returned my look and we proceeded to head back to the chilled section. I looked at my designated driver and told her  it s ok  John had probably finished work and was heading to a party with all that beer.  We returned to the chilled section where (I may get this wrong) Kazlick was sorting the 2 mains 2 sides for ¬£6 section. I approached him on my hunt.  Excuse me  do you sell mozzarella dippers  Mmmm his reply  mozzarella dippers?  He walked off and I followed. He approached his colleague who s name I did not catch but before he could ask after my mozzarella dippers this man proceeded to shout at him about not putting the 2 pint of semi skimmed milk on the shelves - poor Kazlick was only trying to help me - he finally got chance to ask and they were pointed out to me by shouty milk man - not a smile on site. At this point my friend found me she has also found alternative mozzarella dippers for the same price but in different packaging on the chilled section we were puzzled but we thanked Kazlick and went to pay. Upon paying - our service with a smile continued to be non existent. As we were leaving we realised we had forgotten the limes - so I headed to the fruit section to which both members of staff on said section were too busy flirting to direct me to where they were so I found them myself. The only person who redeemed this terrible shopping experience was the man on customer services who was friendly  approachable and all that a person in retail should be. Whilst paying I noticed John having a good old chat with the security card so my thoughts about him finishing work were quickly dismissed and he obviously just isn t very good at his job. Overall my visit to Tesco today was disappointing.  I would probably give it a 4/10 and that s being nice. We are eating said mozzarella dippers right now and I must say I just wish I had held the handle in the car and let me friend take us a little bit further to Waitrose.  This taught me to trust my friend and not men called John who work at Tesco. In this case every little didn t help In fact John was helpless.;;;;;2016-10-22T18:11:36+0000;1477159896;2016-10-22 20:11:36;0;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0

According to my online account I have received ten coupons in the last six months  but I haven t received any nor has any every been available on my account. Is this due to the fact that my account had been changed to say that I did not want to receive marketing or money off offers from Tesco? If that is the case  why was I never informed that this was now the case as I have never changed these details?  It s gotten a bit ridiculous just how much the incentive schemes have been cut down over the last year  adding to that that the shop continues to use confusing and misleading offers in store and the fact that I have gone from getting coupons every time I got my vouchers to not getting anything at all has not put Tesco in any more of a favourable light with me.;;;;;2016-10-22T17:20:25+0000;1477156825;2016-10-22 19:20:25;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Have taken the advice from your helpline and uninstalled and reinstalled the app after clearing browsing history etc.  Something is seriously wrong. Am beyond frustrated and understand there have been 8 problems like mine today..Have re entered my card details and persevered but am now giving up. Thought I might be able to pay over the phone  but your system does not allow this  so goodbye to my order. I won t have the weekend I planned but I sincerely hope you are able to sort this out soon  as you are going to lose revenue and loyalty.  Had this problem last week but re entering the card details worked on that occasion. Also had a problem the week before that when I had to change my password as the previous and original one was not recognised.

We particularly have one driver who goes above and beyond ever time. My kids are so happy to see him and he always makes us smile. He is called Mario and works in the Newcastle/ north Tyneside area. It would make me so happy if he could be acknowledged for excelling in customer service. He is such a lovely  genuine guy that you are so lucky to have working for Tesco.

I would like to thank the staff in your Flitwick  Bedfordshire store for being not only extremely helpful but going above and beyond the call of duty today.  My 9 year old son was playing at the park with his friends after school and some children took it upon themselves to bully and threaten him.  He made his way into Tesco and asked the lovely lady at customer service if he could use a phone to call and ask me to collect him. The lady called me herself  explained what had happened and kept my son in the store talking to him until I got there. When I arrived she even walked him out to pass him over to me. To top it off  he had his bike there  which wouldn t fit in my car. So another member of staff put his bike in their car and delivered it back to my home address.   I think you ll agree this was over answer beyond the call of duty. Their kindness and compassion  really has touched me. Unfortunately I was so worried about my son I failed to make a note of their names but I will return tomorrow to find out. They should be rewarded highly for their excellent customer service.;;;;;2016-10-21T17:38:39+0000;1477071519;2016-10-21 19:38:39;2914;113;3150;154;3417;113;103;10;124;0;2890;219;15;0;0;0;0

Bought a few bits  6 things actually. Went to the self services till to pay. The screen was on the usual  home  screen where it said start. There was also a bit that said cards only  no coins or cash or something similar. This wasn t a problem as I was using my card any way.  I scanned my first item  a cake that was ¬£2.65. I put it in the bag and as I went to get item No. 2 to scan  I noticed the screen showed my one item at ¬£2.65 but the total at the bottom of the screen was ¬£5.25.  I Calle dyne assistant over. She looked puzzled. Suggested we cancel the transaction and start again. This now worked fine.  I asked her how this happened. Her answer was that the person before me had moved tills! But there were no other items listed  otherwise I would have noticed them.  She said oh it does it sometimes. It would be ok any way as you could get your money back from customer services. Oh that s ok the.  Assuming of course I realised the total was wrong or checked my receipt.  So how often does this happen? How often does a shopper unknowingly pay for something they haven t had? Would some older or with a learning disability be expected to notice? Not saying they wouldn t notice but it would be harder.  Extra few quid. Multiplied  by how many people  how many stores?  Every little helps!;;;;;2016-10-21T13:33:41+0000;1477056821;2016-10-21 15:33:41;3;26;3;0;29;26;4;22;4;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

But when my husband went in our local store (One of the large stores in Hemel Hempstead) to pick up a Tesco direct brochure so mum could browse herself  they had none??? Where can i get one Tesco?

As I previously mentioned  you closed my credit card account due to inactivity. I used the account to make a payment so that you would not close it. However you closed it with a balance on it. So that leads us to paying off the amount. A I had a direct debit attached I wasn t worried. But when you closed the account you cancelled the direct debit. Now you have charged me ¬£12 for late payment. How on earth do you end up with procedures and systems so full of illogic? Please advise?;;;;;2016-10-21T10:30:09+0000;1477045809;2016-10-21 12:30:09;4;5;4;0;9;5;1;4;0;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

I popped into Tesco at Wath upon Dearne yesterday and found two lovely tops. Once at the cash desk I realised I didn t have my card with me  infact I had left it in another store the night before. I told the cashier my dilemma and asked if she could save the tops for me which totalled ¬£65 and I would pick them up tomorrow morning. The assistant replied No we cannot do that we haven t the room  you must collect them today. I told her as I have to travel back to town to collect my card I wouldn t have time as I am going to work. She was totally unsympathetic and said it s the policy  nothing I can do. She could see I was upset  but didn t seen to care. It s ironic that the staff all wear badges with  here to help   and your motto is  every liitle helps  Just to let u know Tesco I see myself as being a very loyal customer. I have shopped in this branch since it opened spending on average ¬£250 a month plus my husband fills his car every month in their petrol station. After yesterday I feel that you don t value this loyalty and questioning why do I bother and just take my custom else where.  I ve not bothered going back to the shop for the tops if your interested.;;;;;2016-10-21T10:08:03+0000;1477044483;2016-10-21 12:08:03;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My fitbit must have fallen off and after re-tracing my steps I went to the Customer Service desk to see if anyone had handed it in. I was seen to by Amy and although no-one had handed it in she took my details and said if it was handed in she would phone. I was gutted to say the least but such is life  got on with my shopping. Half way round the shop Amy found me and told me an amazing lady had handed it in  she initially thought it was hers as she had an identical one. She didn t leave a name or contact but she was an NHS worker  if anyone knows who it was please thank her for me.

I displayed my ID when asked but they refused to sell me the scratch card as I was with my mates who couldn t provide ID I received immature and sarcastic behaviour from the serving staff member. I felt this was uncalled for and extremely rude  it was like getting treated as a kid.  she also sarcastically smiled and put the thumbs up as I left the store.  After getting so worked up over this incident I decided to confront the staff member and get her name to complain about her. As I walked back into the store she tried to avoid me and tried to walk off but I just managed to see jacquie s name badge.   Once I got jacquie s name I went to leave the store as I had seen my college lecturer who asked about the incident as he could see I was wound up.   my college lecturer informed Jacquie that we would raise a complaint   Jacquie continued the poor customer service by dismissing my college lecturer and walking away saying  Do I look bothered  This left both me and my lecturer shocked and speechless!  This is by far the worst customer service ever received!  - Joe white;;;;;2016-10-20T12:57:59+0000;1476968279;2016-10-20 14:57:59;1;2;1;0;3;2;1;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Its not after 11pm yet I say. I ask where the drivers last delivery was and told he was at Erith at 10pm which is only 5 minutes away . ( Which is where the online shopping distribution centre is ... how suspicious... Maybe he is parked up in a layby which I ve been now told  the drivers do to waste time if their deliveries are delayed) So there is no reason why my shopping could of been delivered in the delayed time slot you gave me.

This morning at around 9.30 in the Harold Wood Essex area  I was happily pulling in to my works carpark as I do every morning when unexpectedly a Tesco van pulled in behind me. Not unusual you might think but as we don t order from Tesco I was slightly confused. The lovely driver parked in the corner of our carpark and climbed out of his van whilst I m still confused as to what he could possibly be delivering. A few moments later he gets back in the van and merrily drives off. Leaving a puddle of his urine against our fence. If he wanted to use the toilet he should have just asked. Not what you expect to see on a Wednesday morning and a very bad red representation of your staff!;;;;;2016-10-19T08:50:09+0000;1476867009;2016-10-19 10:50:09;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Yesterday I ve been shopping to your branch in Elgin and i carry my disabled 5 years old son with me inside the store thinking that you have a special push cart that i can put him into. ( the same one as what you got in your buckie branch ) but surprisingly elgin branch don t have any  i ask one of the employee in the costumer service shes very nice she said they don t have any of the special push cart  i said why they don t have it. its handy so i don t need to put my son into his wheelchair because i can only take a small basket if i put him on his wheelchair. Then the lady said they got a push cart that can attached to the wheelchair we tried it on but because my son s wheelchair still small and narrow its to dangerous coz he might bang his head on the handle of the push cart because its too close on his face. So i just decided to take make son on his wheelchair and me taking a small basket thats not really good thing considering its to hard to push a wheelchair while im carrying a heavy basket pull of things that i need and i cannot do more shopping to do with a small basket. Hopefully you can get one of that special push cart on your elgin branch. For sure it s not only my son thats been looking for one when they go shopping with there special needs kids.

The milkfloat goes round at an ungodly hour (5.18am past my house) and in an effort to not annoy and awake every living being on its round the providers of this amazing service worked out almost 80 years ago that a quiet float is better. To that end they invented the electric milk float  which was eerily silent and  floated  around its rounds delivering it s goods and making breakfast a happy time for millions of people across this fair land.   So my question would be  why do you choose to use an old rattly transit van that sounds like an earthquake moving down the street  and with the frequent stops I get to listen it idling a few times down my street as it wakes up the sparrows. I can assure you it needs a service  or quite possibly just scrapping completely.   Whilst I appreciate it may not sound too loud during daylight hours   imagine the dead of night silence in a quiet residential area being completely and utterly shattered by what I actually thought for the first few times was an articulated lorry.   Do you have any plans to replace the cursed vehicle that wakes me every morning without fail  or should I invest in some heavy duty earplugs?    This would have been a wittier message  but the truth is I am exhausted.  Tidworth  Wiltshire.;;;;;2016-10-18T18:12:42+0000;1476814362;2016-10-18 20:12:42;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

One particular time I felt a seizure coming on and in panic I notified a member of the security team who was nearby and he helped me out of my wheelchair and onto the floor   and phoned for an ambulance and stayed with me and when I came round he was very reassuring and helpful  another occasion I was sat in the cafe and I felt fine but a member of the security team was walking by and actually noticed the warning signs before I did ! He calmly advised me to lie on the floor and minutes later I was in a seizure which in my opinion and experience goes well above and beyond what is expected. I would definitely say that Tesco are good with people who have disabilities as sometimes I m in my chair and struggle to reach something off a shelf and if a member of staff is passing by they will often pick the item off the shelf for me .Thank you :);;;;;2016-10-17T22:10:03+0000;1476742203;2016-10-18 00:10:03;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

She felt very nervous about getting her eyes tested  we spoke about it over and over again at the weekend  trying to reassure that there is nothing to worry about. We also watched kids friendly video about the visit to optitian to ease the worries  however she started to cry uncontrollably every time we mentioned it.  When we arrived at Tesco  she hid around the corner and refused to coorporate. She was very upset and could not overcome the fear. I informed one of the member of staff ( Michelle) about the possibility that we might need to cancel our appointment. Michelle was very understanding and told us to take as much time as needed. While I was trying convince my little girl  Michelle came around the corner with a sticker and started to have a friendly chat. They both agreed to book another appointment in a weeks time. As a parent I felt so grateful and even amazed of such  friendly and understanding approach. Michelle booked new appointmen after checking a diary to make sure  her friend  will be there to meet us. She also describe her friend ( colleague) to my little girl. Additionally she offered her to see both rooms that she will need to visit on the day of her appointment. My little girl replied that she will possibly do it next time. Michelle understood that it is important for a child to feel familiar with the setting  changed her offer saying- ok  can I show mummy then? You can also come with us. She happily agreed. Michelle was very positive and friendly towards us and even allowed to test the equipment. I can not express  how much I appreciate Michelles amazing skills and kindness. My daughter was just another customer in Michelles busy day but for my daughter it changed the whole day and I believed made her a better person by showing how a complete stranger can care and support someone who is feeling scared or upset. She skipped around the shop and mentioned the lovely lady in Tesco opticians. My little girl cant wait to see Michelle s friend and get her eyes tested next week. Thank you for such a positive experience!;;;;;2016-10-17T20:08:20+0000;1476734900;2016-10-17 22:08:20;2;1;3;2;6;1;1;0;0;0;2;1;0;0;0;0;0

I chose to use your music download service a year or so ago  on the basis that you were competitive on price and that your name meant that you would be a safe bet for the future. I was wrong.  Obviously the main selling point for using a music download service over buying CD s is that it acts as a backup if you should ever lose your music from your computer.  Well  the inevitable happened and my hard drive died  causing me to lose a large amount of music collected over the years. No  problem  I thought  I can always download it again from the various service providers that I have used. Luckily much of this was through Amazon  where I have had no problem in downloading my purchases.  When I came to get the music that I had bought through Tesco though  I found that the service no longer existed. I contacted you by email to ask what alternatives were in place to access the service I had paid for  only to be told that there were none! I was also told that you had emailed all your customers telling them that the service was being withdrawn. Well  I happen to have an email service where no emails are deleted. I went back through them and found no such emails. I am sure that if I d had an email telling  me that a service I had paid for was being withdrawn I d have been having this conversation with you then.  I am left feeling that Tesco s has ripped me off  taking a not inconsiderable amount of money for a service which  at the point of needing it  was not there.;;;;;2016-10-17T19:13:14+0000;1476731594;2016-10-17 21:13:14;0;4;0;0;4;4;1;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Whist paying for my shopping at the self-service check-out the man next to me was just paying for his daily shopping and lunchtime meal deal. He promptly paid and left without looking back to notice he had left his lunch at the check out.   One of your members of staff came over to pick-up the abandoned lunch items and checked to see if he could see the customer who had already left. Following this  to my utter confusion  he threw the items into the trash.   As I witnessed this  confused by the utter wastefulness  I looked out of the window to see the homeless man who I pass outside your store every day salvaging through the bin for scraps of food - what a messed up world we live in!

Funny looking Lego eh?  So we ve spent ¬£33 and instead received a PS4.   Now  some might call us a pair of mugs but the conscious in our heads told us we couldn t keep it  I mean some poor employee in the warehouse is probably gonna lose their job over it right?   Call it  is there a thanks? Cheers for covering one of our employees?  Oh can you drive out of your way and drop it in a Tesco extra? (No we don t live near one).

I ve been having a much needed sort out and filing session over the past weekend to try and have a post-summer tidy up. This included filing a few Clubcard statements that had been sat on the post table for the past year(!) or so  so I only noticed this niggle today.      When doing Clubcard statements/mailings that the customer might be inclined to file or archive in some way  please can you *avoid* the use of glue-spots or strips anywhere on the mailing itself? These have a nasty tendancy to be impossible to remove from the mailing without prior knowlege of how to do this (Normally requiring a heat gun or hairdryer and a lot of patience) and tend to cause statements to stick to other documents  which makes filing a complete pig. :-o      If the use of glue could be restricted to the flap of the mailing alone (As used to be the case) this would be far better and much appreciated by many customers  especially as a gluey flap on its own is much easier to remove and dispose of separately.      Many thanks in advance for following the above recommendation. :-);;;;;2016-10-17T00:07:07+0000;1476662827;2016-10-17 02:07:07;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We understand this may be quite a petty complaint but we re really upset at the poor quality of this product.

After we finish the long queue for the  self check out  one of the staff members said we can t check out there because in her eyes  we have a lot of articules  and she may loses a lot of time to help us out in case the machine blocks. We explain her that we have been doing the same shopping  for the last 5 years and no one has requested such a thing before. Then she said all right. 5 minutes after she pointed her finger on us and sent some one else to make us move to a cashier. With have of our groceries already checked  he stopped the machine with the argument that our shopping was to big. They didn t even let us to finish or listen to us  just tell us to move! Was a very embarrassing and humiliating! that never happened in the 5 years we have been shopping there!

The card may be faulty but it worked less than an hour before in a petrol station chip and pin.  The customer service guy gave me some line about how if you use swipe and sign instead it s open to fraud but I can t imagine many people keep a deliberately broken chip card especially so they can sign for purchases and then immediately withdraw all the money - since you only use swipe as a backup.  Swipe and sign (and even taking an impression of the card) are still valid backup systems.  If the chip and pin goes down store-wide are you going to only trade in cash and turn away all the other customers?

All arrived and in good order  I noticed that carrier bags were used despite me accepting not to. Then I found out why. There had been a spate of safety issues raised  mainly about entering customers  houses and that the  van-to-fridge  delivery may not always be guaranteed.  Whether this is a local issue or a nationwide issue I do not know  but the point I would like to raise is that I am a disabled person with mobility problems and rely on your delivery person to bring my weekly shopping to my kitchen. Take that away I will have no choice but to find another supplier.  KInd regards   Hazel Brewer  PS In my last job I did a stint as Safety Officer. I have noticed over the years that some of your delivery personnel double up/treble up the loads to save the number of trips from the van to indoors. Perhaps you can incorporate carrying manageable loads in your next team brief?;;;;;2016-10-16T11:13:28+0000;1476616408;2016-10-16 13:13:28;0;5;0;0;5;5;2;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I went to collect ¬£50 worth of toys which I purchased online for my 3 year old daughter to be told when I arrived that the items had already been collected by someone else using my name.   One of your employees went to look at the CCTV and returned to tell me I have to wait until Monday as someone is on holiday!!!   I am left without a refund or the items which I have purchased and as a result my daughter is left without her toys because apparently no one else in the store can deal with this in the managers absence.   I cannot afford to pay ¬£50 for more toys and am left now explaining to my child why she doesn t have any presents for her birthday.

I m 29 and she could easily be my daughter! When questioning if all adults and families with children are refused alcohol in store your answer is it s  objective . What on earth does that mean? This is the sort of rubbish I read in the newspaper and think surely it s because the customer isn t telling the full story  but nope. This is just a hopelessly pathetic policy Tesco have decided to make up to make the public feel like idiots in public when shopping. I feel sorry for the young lad who had to tell me this  because it isn t his fault but no doubt one of the many silly rules Tesco impose on their employees. I ll remember in future when I have children and want to buy alcohol to leave them tied up outside. Look out for my next post whereby a child is abducted from tesco because of their failed   objective  policies. Before you get worried  no  I won t be tieing a child up outside one of your stores whilst I go shopping. I ll just be going shopping elsewhere where these silly policies do not exist.

I have recently been into our local tesco on a few occasions now and I ve wanted to buy some bread  rolls  pastries and cookies what have yellow stickers on them and I ve been told I m not allowed to buy them as they are giving them to a homeless charity. Now while I think it s fantastic they are giving food away to charity instead of putting them in the bin I think the way I have been treated when asked if I can buy something on your shelves you sell isn t at all fair.  I struggle for money like lots of people do and reduced food at the end of the day really helps. I think it s brilliant if when the shop shuts they ship the food off to the food banks etc rather than chuck it in the bin but if I come into your shop to purchase something off your shelfs I should be allowed to buy them.;;;;;2016-10-15T16:00:58+0000;1476547258;2016-10-15 18:00:58;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

So cross in fact I may throw a princess sized tantrum. However  this is an impossibility. Why I hear you ask? I have no wand!  I bought myself a Glow heart wand from your store in anticipation of being the glowiest princess at the party. Great idea right? Not so. You see I also bought two more Glow wands so I can have fellow Glow princesses. However  as we handed out the wands amongst ourselves  I had the last one.  We were discussing how they may work their glow magic when disaster struck! My fairy princess glow wand felt like it was in fact missing... the wand!  Alas I have a heart but nowhere to mount it s magic! I haven t yet opened my wand so it may be that mine is the magicest and has an invisibility spell on the wand (quite clever I do say  if this proves to be the case). I am now the grumpiest Princess at the party. Please can you advise how you intend to restore peace to the kingdom and the magic to my wand! :);;;;;2016-10-15T13:17:53+0000;1476537473;2016-10-15 15:17:53;0;2;2;1;5;2;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;2;0;0;0

I bought a car DVD player from Tesco and it broke  I took it back and you replaced it for another one. This week the DVD player broke again.  My partner took it to the Aberdeen store on Thursday and explained the situation  the shop assistant phoned your head office and then came back to my partner and said okay we have refunded your money back to your card that you bought the DVD player with.  My partner said that he hadnt wanted a refund he wanted an exchange and also that the card that we had bought this with was no longer the bank that we used  the shop assistant went and called head office again and explained the situation. Head office said that because the card was under my name and not my partners if I called the next day with my new card details that they would get this sorted and paid to the correct card.  I called yesterday to be told that the payment has already been made to my old bank and there is nothing they can do about it. I apparently have to phone my old bank (which I have no details of at all as it s an old bank account and I have no paperwork for it) and try get my money back.  To make matters worse Tesco can t even give me an ANR number (I believe that s the correct name) until Monday maybe Tuesday to even try sort out this mess that Tesco have created.  I now have a very upset daughter as she has no DVD player and we have not been given our money so can t even go out and buy her a new one. I have asked for compensation and apparently even that can t be dealt with as the situation is not resolved. This would not of been a situation if Tesco had asked if we wanted an exchange or a refund rather than just decide we were getting a refund and not give us the chance to say we had changed bank details.  I am very unhappy about this and will be putting this on social media as to how Tesco have treated me.;;;;;2016-10-15T13:13:36+0000;1476537216;2016-10-15 15:13:36;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I stayed on the bike as I always do  and he got off and began to use the pump. Across the filling station came a very irate store person shouting  you have to get off  you have to get off   when she got to us she repeated  you have to get off the bike   when my husband asked why she said  its legislation its the law you cant fill your bike with a passenger on the back  (I m not a passenger I m a pillion). I explained I couldn t get off whilst the bike was being filled up  she said  well were going to stop the pump then  and proceed to move her hand in front of her throat in a slashing motion to her colleague in the store  who stopped the pump. I would like to know which law she was talking about and exactly what the legislation states.

The first customer service assistant added that it s not nice  but the other assistant shrugged again and said  nothing we can do . No apology or empathy  baring in mind I needed to purchase some necessities. I am now stuck with no card  can t get the shopping I needed.

I was waiting to buy stamps. The lady in the queue ahead of me was being served at the till by a Tesco rep but having a personal conversation with a second Tesco rep who was standing at the end of the counter. I waited while the transaction completed. Then waited some more as they continued their personal conversation which was about the second Tesco reps health problems. And waited... Finally the customer ahead of me wrapped up the conversation and left so the counter was free for me approach. I took a step forward....But no. The second  rep said to the one serving that she wanted to put her stuff through the till  so (both still ignoring me) the two members of staff put her items through (2 bottles of hairspray and a packet of sandwiches). This is with the second rep leaning over the end of the counter to pass them to the serving rep. Neither of them even looked at me although it was blatantly obvious I was waiting. I waited a bit more. Finally they completed putting the rep s transaction on  stored  because she wanted to pay for it later. Finally the serving rep looks up at me. No smile  no  sorry for making you wait   nothing. I asked for the stamps. She put the transaction through without saying a word  then handed my my receipt and said  there you go  no thank you  no goodbye. It really p****d me off. Customer service in your stores is usually excellent. These two members of staff are pretty rubbish examples of that. It s not nice to feel like a nuisance for actually trying to buy something.

We always do our shopping in Tesco and i would hate to go to an other supermarket so it would be really good if you could have some nice vegan choccie boxes! I know you brought out other new vegan food not long ago eg. burgers in the frozen section which i love!

Everyone from the concerned lady who interrupted her packing duties to ensure help was called  to the first aiders who examined our son  called the paramedics and stayed with us until the medical team arrived and the in-store janitors who cleaned up the mess with smile and word of encouragement  to the pharmacy staff who kindly allowed us the use of their private room and the gentleman who brought a bottle of water for my son - you were so kind and helpful to us and we appreciate all your help immensely.  We also wish to thank the retired GP who examined our son and Steve and Carly  the two paramedics who assisted us on the scene.

Today I put 20p in the machine and waited for it to start. Nothing! I then noticed the sign saying it s 50p for air. 10% increase on Marmite doesn t sound so bad when you re actually getting a product for that. This is air! Dispensed by a machine that s always been there. Can you please justify a 150% increase on basically something Mother Nature provides for free?

On Thursday 13th Oct I purchased two newborn pramsuits and when I got home I found one had been displayed on the wrong hanger and was the wrong size. So this morning  Friday 14th  I ve returned to Store to change it for the correct size. While in store I met three ladies from your team in the clothing department (I m sorry  I didn t catch their names) One who checked to see if any of the pramsuits were in the newborn size I wanted. (There wasn t any) Another lady that ordered the pramsuit online for me (I m picking it up tomorrow) and another lady who refunded me. All three of these ladies were so helpful. Now  it might seem like they ve not done anything out of the ordinary and that they re just  doing their job  but when it s 8am  you re heavily pregnant with twins  you re exhausted from lack of sleep  your feet are swollen so you have to waddle everywhere and all you want to do is sit down with some chocolate ~ this service  friendly chat and helpfulness means a lot.

I did some shopping after I finished my shift at Clacton 5125 on Saturday the 1st of October. The amount after staff discount came to ¬£80.74. I was chatting to one of my colleagues and being distracted  removed my card a smidge too early  cancelling the transaction. Tried again  and payment went though fine. I didn t realise that the first amount had still been earmarked from my account  and the second transaction went through. I thought the amount set inside my account all this time was the second try but having just checked my account  the second try went out of my account fine on the 3rd. I ve just spoken to my bank  and they said that the amount appeared to have been cancelled at the merchants end  and that I would have to wait for it to be returned to me. I have the transaction number  but was just wondering if there is any way to get it cancelled at Tesco s end so I can get the money back. Is there anything you can do  or do I have to speak to the store manager/customer services?

I want to give a big shout out to the home delivery lady  who upon my arrival home from work  had just finished unloading my shopping to my husband and was about to get back in her van. However  she waited for me to get out my car and said  before I drive off I just want to check you are ok with the substitution  I know your husband is but now I have seen you  I thought I would check with you as well . I was pretty impressed by this as she could easily have just waved and driven off.

Its important I feel  to let you know that I scanned as I shopped.  Long story short  just as I was nearly done Jens asked me to carry him as he was tired. Seconds later he was throwing up on me in the isle  2 shots fired.  Fortunately it seems my hood caught most of it  with the rest running down his jumper and my chest. Fortunately we somehow managed to avoid a spilage..well at least one that would have required a Tannoy announcement.  So i pushed my trolley to the toilet carrying Jens and smelling absoultely revolting. In the loo I bagged my jacket and my tshirt and Jens s jumper  handsoaped my chest  neck and his hands and face.  Thankfully I could quickly pay and be on my way. I walked gracefully and topless to the scan as you shop (SAYS) tills and scanned the barcode to upload my list.   Then I was selected for a random security check....I don t blame you Tesco but I swear to god you check me everytime!  The girl manning the SAYS walked past me with judgemental eyes  obviously not the reaction I would have hoped for when topless but still  i was aware I probably stilled stank of sick. I tried to pass her my scanner in a frenzy and explained  child  sick  me. She was having trouble with another customers security check and she soon walked back to them. Now I dont wanna complain and I know I cant justify queue jumping (or can I?) But she didnt even seem to call for an extra hand. So i stood there topless  smelling of sick waiting to get my kid home for a bath.  Definately not a long story short it seems.  Anyway I m not here to complain  I wanted to thank the gentleman that came and handed me a t-shirt. I was a bit rushed and didnt get a chance to see his name or anything  but he came over handed me a t-shirt and allowed me to gain back some of my dignity. He was wearing a Tesco jacket so I am assuming he wasnt a random handing me clothes to steal...  It was a very small and very kind gesture and I hope you identify him and give him some recognition for it  he is clearly a credit to Tesco for his customer service. Well unless what you take from this is that your staff are giving away clothes...  I was eager to get home and I was dealing with a variety of emotions  this guy made it all that little bit easier.   So thanks Tesco  thanks Tesco employee and sorry to you both if there are any unfrozen chunks in isle 2!;;;;;2016-10-13T19:10:22+0000;1476385822;2016-10-13 21:10:22;22;15;23;2;40;15;12;3;2;0;22;1;0;0;0;0;0

I shop for a family of 5  which I m sure you can imagine means every penny counts. It is a regular occurrence on my shopping that items are missing (I contacted about this previously as on numerous occasions my alcohol was missing from my order). It is also a weekly occurrence that some of my items are substituted  which is an inconvenience but understandable. I chose not to complain when you substituted the wine I d ordered for non alcoholic wine. However this evening I am again left unhappy. I ordered 1 pack of super bock Portuguese lager 4x330ml for ¬£4. You have delivered 1 individual bottle of Chimay blue for ¬£2.49. Please explain how one bottle worth 3/4 of the price is a substitute? This is happening far too often!;;;;;2016-10-13T19:09:50+0000;1476385790;2016-10-13 21:09:50;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

When you do click & collect they do not tell you that you need to keep the confirmation email to return the item to the store so then you have to go all the way to the post office to send if back. But the best thing is that they can t even get the order correct. It s so much easier to order from the professionals like asda.;;;;;2016-10-13T19:00:12+0000;1476385212;2016-10-13 21:00:12;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I received a text to say it could be delayed by up to half and hour which was fine. I then received another text message to say it could be up to 11.05pm. With a 5am start this morning that was too late. I called in and explained this to be told they could reschedule to this evening which I was fine with. At 10pm I was just heading to bed when your driver arrived with my shopping  I thought great he has made it. He handed me my shopping apologising for some of it being wet. This was a huge understatement... at least 60% of my shopping was covered in red wine... the driver spotted this and said oh there must have been a breakage on the van ( I hadn t ordered any wine) I then had to stand and wash loads of my shopping  kitchen sides mop my floors and front step. The last thing I wanted to be doing after a long day ... I then discovered the tissues I ordered where unusable so called the call centre this evening after work. I was told that my shopping was still scheduled for this evening?????? I explained I had already had it. He said we ll you asked for it to be rescheduled and that s what they have done so again explained I thought that seeing as they delivered my shopping there was no need for another delivery..? He then advised that I would still have been charged for today s shopping??? I explained that if they have charged me again then I would be left with no money for a week. As a single working mother of four children under 7 every penny counts and I cannot cope without that money. He offered no solution other than to process the refund which will still take 5 days! He said I should have been informed another payment would be taken during my original call as this is how rescheduling works...  this was never explained to me (please listen to the call) as i wasn t  rescheduling out of choice as it was a delay caused by Tesco. I am now left with no money at all and 4 children to provide for... thanks.;;;;;2016-10-13T18:50:39+0000;1476384639;2016-10-13 20:50:39;3;3;3;0;6;3;2;1;0;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

Firstly radox shower gel now I find this shower gel to be amazing and that s just simply because on offer it s ¬£0.90 not a pound or ¬£0.99 but 90p and you gotta love a bargain  secondly you ve scrapped pot noodle??? üò° how do you expect my children to get a well balanced meal now with no pot noodle available yours are ok but without that tasty sachet of goodness the kids just won t get the same nutrition from them! I m not to fussed about the flora as it s always far to expensive with it being a margarine for the rich people ect then there is the loss of the lynx deodorant?? At a pound a can on offer this makes us feel less Chavvy because it s quite a well known brand to have on your shelf with the value soap you know! So please Tesco from a concerned customer please please reconsider your actions! If I can be of any assistance in striking a deal with these companies to get them back please don t hesitate to contact me obviously if successful I d require some free treats from you ie a pot noodle for each three kids at least 5 radox and maybe some lynx??

Just been to Tesco supermarket at Wrekin Retail Park in Telford. Drove round for about 5 mins looking for a parent and child space. After parking  me and my husband witnessed a couple (say mid to late 60 s) with NO children park in a parent and child space. My husband approached them and asked   you do that you are parked in a parent and child s space? They are for people with kids ? The man just shrugged his shoulders. My husband then said   we just drove round for 5 mins looking for a space  he said   so what  and started walking off. My husband then said   I hope you get fined  and the man said   if I get fined  I get fined  he then walked off with his wife towards the shops on the OTHER SIDE of the retail park ! So not only did he park in parent and child space  he parked in Tesco car park when he wasn t even going there !  We reported them to the friendly staff at Customer services in store but they advised us there isn t anything they can do and unfortunately all they can do is ask them to move. The law hasn t come in yet at Tesco for people to be fined.   I took a pic of the car.

I don t have photo ID. I have no need for it- I am a 27 year old who looks 27- I don t get ID d for age restricted items. I do not drive so I don t have a drivers licence  and I ve not been abroad in nearly 10 years- so my passport is still in my maiden name and is also now out of date...I do however have the bank card which I paid for the item with  I have the order number and emails from Tesco with the barcode to be scanned. I have an out of date provisional with my photo (I ve not changed much in 10 years  it s quite obviously me) yet all of this is not enough to prove to tesco that I am the person who made the order.   I am due to collect a Hatchimal toy from your store this afternoon and messaged yesterday afternoon after finding that when you say you need identification that this means photo ID and not just the payment card and was told that no it needs to be IN DATE photographic identification.   I am still going to store (after all I ve just paid  ¬£57 for a toy my daughter is desperate for for Christmas  and which is sold out everywhere else) I will take with me the proof of identification which I have and which was acceptable for the DBS service to verify my identification last week so I could work in my daughters school. Should none of this be enough to collect the item I have bought and paid for  then I am afraid Tesco you are going to have one exceptionally angry lady in your store.   I bought some toys from The Entertainer a couple of weeks ago using their own click and collect service...all I had to do was go in there with my order email and my payment card and they gave me my goods.

Where do WE stand in all this? Maybe this is the opportunity to question if Britain even wants any of all that rubbish anymore. Maybe it s an opportunity to close this picture and People stand up to refuse any more poisoning.  This is not sbout boycotting. There are healthy options out there to knorr cubes  lipton tea and helmans mayonaise etc. Maybe Tesco can start stocking Ethically manufactured  organic certified  GMO-free products.  Many argue these products are more expensive  but then it is an opportunity to buy and eat what we need for our sustenance and health and not have fridges and cupboards overflowing with stuff that expires and winds up in the bin.  We do have choice. Imagine that? How lucky we are to have choice. We can choose for our health and for the planet.;;;;;2016-10-13T07:04:18+0000;1476342258;2016-10-13 09:04:18;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Do you routinely train your checkout staff to accuse customers of theft over their headsets in front of said customer without any cause to?  After visiting your Tring Road  Aylesbury store this evening I found a lovely pair of PJ bottoms in your clearance section - at 6 months pregnant its the little comforts! so whilst my other half went to check the price on a fryer (that was missing the shelf edge label) my 6 year old and I finished our shopping and headed towards the self service checkout. My other half had returned the fryer to the shelf and said how rude the checkout assistant Fozia was claiming she was unable to price check items so would have to take it to another till - Complete rubbish! We continued to the self service checkout and proceeded to scan our items  on scanning the PJ bottoms they came up as ¬£9 instead of the marked sticker ¬£5. ¬£4 difference not a major issue but still a pricing error I called for the assistant and Fozia unfortunately was the one to  assist . She looked at the sale sticker pulled it about and then over her headset loudly claimed that she had a customer at the checkouts who had changed a sale sticker and could someone confirm the price. My blood boiling at this point - being accused of tampering with sale stickers I asked to see the duty manager. Another member of checkouts arrived and exclaimed the till price was correct and again claimed the sticker had obviously been tampered with. I again calmly explained I wanted to see the duty manager  well the DM Tracey? Was apparently unavailable so Alison came over to apologise. Alison repeatedly said how sorry she was however as I m sure you can imagine by this point I wasn t going to continue my purchase purely out of principle! Is it really worth accusing and infuriating a customer over ¬£4?! I m absolutely furious at the complete lack of customer service and inability to handle a complaint in store that I ve had to resort to posting this!;;;;;2016-10-12T20:09:36+0000;1476302976;2016-10-12 22:09:36;0;5;3;0;8;5;3;2;0;0;0;0;3;0;0;0;0

Well Tesco WONT do this for me  they told me to contact the supplier which is The Sports HQ. They don t deliver upstairs and so have advised that Tesco should deliver upstairs as per the website.

The groceries online has been my life line   I have a very badly disabled son and going shopping is often impossible so I rely on getting the right groceries delivered to my door..... I was disappointed when Tesco stopped the voucher double ups as I saved and used it to buy my sons Christmas present  which has often saved Christmas for us and quite frankly the triple points on days out mean nothing to us as my boy couldn t go to the theme parks etc  but that wasn t enough to make me think about moving to a different supermarket  the minimum spend of ¬£40 was also a bit of a problem as I can t now suddenly decide to get a few extras delivered when I need them when my son it too ill to go out  again I decided to stay loyal and keep going....... BUT..... in the last few months the deliveries themselves have got worse and worse..... the substitutions have become ridiculous..... (cling film instead of the tin foil I ordered)... in the last few deliveries I ve had rotten items  missing items  a whole bag full missing and I now send back more substitutes than I accept..... the customer service team are always polite and will refund when things are wrong immediately but quite frankly when I can almost guarantee there will be items wrong or missing that s no consolation when I then have to go without something I need or make arrangements for someone to sit with my son so I can then go and get them....... I pay for delivery saver but tonight I am having a delivery from Morrisons and over the next few weeks I will try Asda  Sainsbury etc and if they can give better service I feel I will have no option but to cancel it and go elsewhere.... after being a customer for 30 years that saddens me........;;;;;2016-10-12T13:53:21+0000;1476280401;2016-10-12 15:53:21;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Came to the point she was getting very frustrated with us because we had to explain she was scanning the same item 3 times to then go ahead and shout in front of customers and staff  THIS IS MY PROBLEM WITH YOU PEOPLE  to which I asked what she meant by this for her to then say quietly to me  what you want to say something now  for me to ask her again what does she mean by her phrase  YOU PEOPLE  (in my eyes a very racist remark) to which she then shouted again in front of everyone  SHUT YOUR MOUTH  and enticing me to fight her! To which I got very upset and angry to the point I kept saying if I said what you said I would be wrong so what makes you right? My point is I got told it was best I left the store (this is my local and I use it everyday) nobody came and asked if me or my partner were okay  the manager was there and did nothing the stuff did nothing!

On the 30th September i had so many problems on your direct site it was unreal. I was trying to order some xmas presents for my girls and i wanted to use my clubcard vouchers. Well that never happened. Basically my clubcard vouchers were used as your site went down. I called to query and was told tbey would be reactivated. That never happened. At 6pm i called back to be told they hadnt been reactivated and they woule do it and call me back. Then i checked my bank and in fact tescos had taken money from my account without anything being ordered. When your customer service representative called me back i explained all of this. He couldnt understand either why money had been taken yet there was no order. Eventually he told me that my vouchers could not be reactivated and to order the items i would need to pay by card  promising me that the money would be refunded as well as the money that had been taken from my account.  Well that hasnt happened so in effect i have paid twice for my order. Not actually sure how you sleep at night knowing you are doing this to people. I have 8 children  every penny counts to me and you have done this. I have always been a loyal customer of tesco well i wont be now. My mum has worked for tesco for 30 years. Frankly if this is how you treat your staff and customers i would rather go elsewhere;;;;;2016-10-12T09:05:25+0000;1476263125;2016-10-12 11:05:25;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I assume around 8pm you reduce your stock to pennies and it invites a groups of people that stand by the doors that you bring the stock out. I have seen this a couple of times now. I was nearly knocked flying when staff brought the bread out.....Tesco need to reduce the stock during the day to allow your loyal shoppers some discount and not attract customers who only want your cheap stock only. I probably spent more than them customers put together but I won t shop in such a awful environment anymore. Why allow this to happen in your store  giving it to the homeless would be a better idea!;;;;;2016-10-11T16:17:33+0000;1476202653;2016-10-11 18:17:33;1;5;1;0;6;5;1;4;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Upon taking my mobile phone contract out I was sold phone insurance. I was advised that I would be covered for loss  damage etc and there would be an excess fee but if there was a fault with the phone there would be no would be no fee. This was the same with a previous provider and so it was never queried and I never checked the small print of the terms and conditions. In hindsight I should never have trusted his word of mouth! My phone has had a few issues over the course of the contract but nothing to require a new device. On Monday of last week my screen went red and then black with white lines. It hadn t been dropped  wet or damaged in any way. I was without internet and phone access until the following day when I called one of your stores. They advised me I would need to contact the insurance team as i have insurance. I spoke to them and was advised for a replacement device it would be a charge of ¬£85.00 due to the excess fee. This is not what I was told when I took out the policy nor is it a process I ve ever known before. I was disgusted as I don t have that money spare but  due to needing a phone for cases of emergencies with school etc  I paid it and requested a call from a complaints manager. I was told they would contact me on Thursday 6th October  the day after the new phone would be delivered. Today I still hadn t received a call and so rang the insurance team again. I got a very rude member of staff who  after reading the notes on the file  asked if I had received a letter advising my complaint was not upheld!! I hadn t actually made a complaint at this time  merely asked to speak to the complaints team. I asked to speak to the complaints team again and she advised me that they don t take calls!!! They read the file and then can take up to 7 weeks to respond. After working for a large corporate firm I know the complaints process and advised the 8 weeks is the ombudsman said timeframe to resolve complaints....not a timeframe to call customers to discuss the matter. She then said that a letter had been sent last night to me advising of the outcome and if I wanted to appeal it to speak to the ombudsman. I asked for an emailed copy whilst I was on the phone and she said she would do this and then came back to state that she wouldn t there and then but that I would have it within an hour. It still hasn t been received. I asked to speak to her manager but was told he wouldn t take the call as a letter had been sent. This is absolutely appalling customer service. I have the times of calls  names of staff and notes of what has been said. I will be making a formal complaint to the ombudsman. Upon my contract ending I will be leaving Tesco mobile. I was conned into an insurance policy and now I m being lied to by staff and not having any remote resolution being offered. To top this all off  there is a fault with the replacement phone to which I m told I have 24 months warranty so it can be fixed free of charge but was only given a 12month warranty with the initial handset. Ridiculous!!!! I used to think that Tesco looked after their customers but this is clearly not the case. This has really upset me and feel I ve been lied to and ignored!!!!;;;;;2016-10-11T16:14:25+0000;1476202465;2016-10-11 18:14:25;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

After finishing our shop we were told by the check out assistant that if we had been parked for longer than 3 hours we will be fined ¬£70. Absolutely no clear signs around the car park advising of this new rule  just steps on how to pay for your parking. If you can t be bothered to put up clear signs advising your customers of this then you have no right in fining them. Do have photos of the signs if you need them as I think you re just trying to scam your customers and your parking marshal agreed with this too.

I appreciate that some stores are the victims of theft and I can understand that your make up counter would be a important area for security measures  but to have a sign saying I have to ring a bell for someone to come and unlock the counter so I can purchase some make up  and then to be stood there for 25 minutes for anyone to come and help is RIDICULOUS!   I stood there for 10 minutes ringing this bell and no on came  I walked to the customer service desk where they made an announcement for someone to attend and still no one! By this point there was 4 customers there stood waiting with me. I walk into the centre isle to find 3 managers standing there having a conversation. I asked one of them for help to be told that she would find someone  and then to fob me off saying that the bell was not working  they WERE working as I could hear them ringing when I was continuously pressing It over and over again.  She then went off to get someone  5 minutes later she comes back with a man who unlocks the counters whilst they were laughing and joking  I didn t find it funny at all. Then under supervision I was then watched whilst they rushed me to pick my make up and then ordered to put it in a security box (which wasn t an issue).   I then went to the self service till to find I then again had to wait a further 10 minutes whilst the lady covering these tills was chatting away with another colleague and cooing over a baby. Not watching the tills at all  and I couldn t scan the make up I wanted because it was all in a box.   A simple quick 10 minute trip to Tesco turned into a 40 minute nightmare. The level of service that store did to help me was disgusting; they have no respect for there customers at all  and quite frankly I won t be going back there if I need something in a rush.

On Sunday I was shopping with my family in your Taunton store minding my own business when one of your staff in an electric wheelchair ran over the back of my foot  she then proceeded to stay there until I told her she needed to reverse off my foot  which she did then she rode off mumbling under her breath  she did not even stop to ask if I was ok. As you can imagine with the weight of her and the wheelchair on the back of my foot I wasn t ok and hobbled around the store until it was so bad I went to your customer services department to report it in the accident book. At customer services the staff member called a manager and laughed as she told him I had been run over  when he arrived he wasn t very sympathetic he handed me a phone to report my accident and then when finished handed me the cheapest bunch of flowers he found in his display saying I hope these make you feel better  well they didn t. I was told someone would ring to check on me on Monday  I never received a phone call from anyone. I could not drive all of Sunday and was still hobbling yesterday.   I m all for employing people with all disabilities but that has to come with some health and safety in mind  she was clearly going to fast for such a busy day instore. The level of customer care I received on the day and since the incident has been poor to put it mildly.;;;;;2016-10-11T11:00:45+0000;1476183645;2016-10-11 13:00:45;1;6;1;0;7;6;2;4;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Usually I really quite like you  but on Saturday you left us cold and disappointed. We ordered a fire pit on Friday morning as your website promised it would arrive at our local store on the Saturday. The email didn t say we  might  be able to pick up our crucial element of garden warmth on Saturday - it said we  can  - which is far more promising  I am sure you d agree! We had guests travelling four and a half hours up to see us  for this weekend just gone. We went out for the day Saturday  and swung by your place at 7 o clock to claim our already paid for outdoor heating system  only to be told it wasn t going to arrive after all - and the next delivery would be Monday. Our friends left on Sunday  Tesco. SUNDAY. We were cold. They were cold. No one likes to be cold. :-( We planned on swanning around in our bikinis just because we could - knowing we would be safe from goosebumps in the blanket of high temperature the fire pit would provide us. I am sad  because apart from my terrible lack of prior planning and allowance for mistakes  this is otherwise utterly your fault. **sighs**;;;;;2016-10-11T10:32:52+0000;1476181972;2016-10-11 12:32:52;1;5;1;0;6;5;4;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Late Saturday afternoon I attended the Lowestoft Tesco store with my daughter to do a bit of shopping later that night I realise I had left my card at the store I rang and they told me to collect as soon as possible I replied that I would as soon as I can but would be in the next few days. On Sunday my daughter was poorly so couldn t leave home Monday my car was at the garage so couldn t get to the store  on Tuesday morning I arrive at the store to be told my card had been cut up as they hold them no longer than 48 hours if I had known this previously I would of tried my best to come sooner or made other arrangements but I don t just live down the road I live 4 miles away if I wanted I could shop at Morrisons which is down the road from me but I don t I choose to shop at Tesco. As you can imagine this is very inconvenient and very annoying if it was made clear they don t hold lost cards longer than 48 hours then this upset could of been avoided.;;;;;2016-10-11T10:17:09+0000;1476181029;2016-10-11 12:17:09;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We are a registered charity in East Ayrshire  Scotland and we regularly purchase baby clothes from your online store for our Baby Starter Packs  which we give out free to families in our area.  We placed an order on the 4th October online and was advised that it would be ready for collection in store on the 5th October.  We went to the Kilmarnock store to pick up our order only to be told that it would be in later that day.    We decided to leave it a day or two so it would definitely arrive  and went back to the store on the 10th October and we were informed that the order couldn t be found.  The assistant telephoned Tesco Direct to speak to them on our behalf and was on the phone to them for over half an hour trying to find out what happened.  We were then advised that the order had been lost and we were asked if we would like to re -order which we agreed to. The member of staff at Tesco Direct had to place the order manually which took another 10 minutes.    Once the order was placed  we were then advised that half of our requested items were out of stock.  Since your clothing F&F line amalgamated with Tesco Direct we have had lots of issues.  Ordering online has become difficult and it takes time to work out what is in stock and what isn t.    As a charity we are always looking for cost effective clothing for babies and are keen to purchase your items and feel that these should be clearly advertised. It is difficult to identify whether clothing suppliers such as Mothercare are being offered as a first choice rather than an affordable brand such as F&F.  As a charity  we value our time and money and if these issues are not resolved  we will have no other option but to use another store.   We look forward to hearing from you.

This morning around 9.10 I pop into my local tesco to see what I could make for my children dinner after a while I decided on potatoes since I had chicken already on my way to the till point I was  tempted by some nuts I took a pack of peanuts and one pack of cashew nuts and some green beans once I reach to the till point I started to scan my items I noticed one of the sales assistant  telling his colleague to come and look what I was doing I paid this no mind as a black person sometimes unfortunately we do get some stereotypes  shallow minded people. Upon scanning the potatoes I realised that they where quite expensive for there was in the package so I decided I m only purchasing one I also bought a loaf of bread and some beans and left behind a packet of nuts and one packet of potato after i left the store i decided to go on the other side of the road where there was a Waitrose so I decided to have a look in there to see if it would meet my needs a bit better I found the items I needed at a cheaper price and more volume so I decided to return the potatoes that I purchased but upon me arriving in store because of the customer assistance behaviour I decided to return everything that I purchased earlier I was greeted with bad manners and attitude which later lead to a verbal altercation with one the staff while he was Taking Back the product to the shelf he made a remarks no one tell you lots to be theifts anyway this really annoyed me and I went on to make a complaint to a store manager and told him his stuff need to apologise because not only did I not put anything my bad that I didn t pay for I did not leave the store without paying for what items I have taken so therefore his staff was rude and accusing me of wrongdoing and I won t stand for it as I m also a manager at Marks and Spencer and I can tell you that there is no way under this heaven that staff could ever deal with a customer like that after speaking to customer service the guy was vaguely and said to me  if I ve spoken to a manager what do I expect him to do. this is not how tesco should do with their customers because your customer is who keeps your business running without your customer you will meet the same end as a lot of these high  street chains . I urge tesco to deal with there customers better as you have just lost a loyal customer to the Waitrose next door.;;;;;2016-10-11T09:48:01+0000;1476179281;2016-10-11 11:48:01;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ordered several toys last week in a single transaction online  for me to collect from store. They were bought to as Father Christmas gifts for my twin daughters and the main present they ve asked for is a baby Annabelle doll each. I decided to collect from a store that isn t necessarily close to where I live but a town that a needed to go to for other reasons so I could run all my errands on the same day. This store is otherwise a 30min car journey out of my way. I received two separate emails to say that all of my items had been delivered to the store but it was clear they had been dispatched to the store in two deliveries - hence receiving two emails. I went to collect the toys and throughly checked that all toys fell under the same order number (which they did) and the shop assistant checked that all the parcels were all of those listed (which they were). As they were all in boxes and silver bags I couldn t see the items when collected but trusted the assistant and Tesco that the order would be correct. Whilst my daughters were still in school on this day that I happened to have off work  I took the parcels to my mums house ready to leave the toys there until Father Christmas could take credit for them. I opened them all  and I only had one baby Annabelle doll - I had definitely ordered and paid for two! The next morning I called The Tesco store I collected from and nobody on the clock and collect counter answered so my call went through to a call centre line instead. I told the story to the other person and I said it is likely the doll was left in the store room and not brought out  or it hasn t been sent along with the other doll by the depot. They said they would need to have someone at the store check so I specifically said they hadn t answered my call and I wasn t willing to wait on the phone for an unknown length of time because I was busy that day  so they said they would call the store themselves to check and call me back. I still have not received this phone call. That day I was fortunate enough to be able to make a trip to that store again 30mins form where I live before my daughters finished school. I again had to explain the situation and a new assistant checked the store room. No doll. The manager came out and was very friendly but he had no answers for me so took down my number and said he would investigate and call me back. A couple of hours later I had a call from another store assistant to say they had another doll there if I wanted to collect it. My response was that I wasn t willling to make a second trip that I shouldn t have had to have taken after already doing one earlier that day  and i preferred that it was delivered. I was especially unable to go to the store with my daughters as it was to collect their Christmas present! The manager again called back later and was more helpful explaining that the depot had forgotten to send the second doll with the other deliveries but they had one in stock and offered to deliver it - but it would only be next time one of their .com vans was coming our way and he wouldn t know the schedules until today (Monday). Fortunately my husband is off work this week  but he didn t want to be waiting in the house all week waiting to see if the doll got delivered or not  especially if it arrived when our daughters were at home. He therefore had to go back instore to collect the doll. 4 separate trips we made between us to collect these toys  it should have only taken one trip! Each journey was a 25 mile round trip  we therefore drove 75 miles for 1.5hrs unnecessarily! Absolute nothing has been offered to us to compensate the trouble we endured. We are only glad that we had time off work over the last week to make sure we could get it! Tesco call centre still haven t called us back as promised but luckily we resolved the problem ourselves. We had hoped that their phone call might have saved us from doing all that driving but after being told those dolls are out of stock online now we had desperately make sure that we got the other doll so both daughters had one for Christmas - it was already paid for! We also felt that one of the assistants in store didn t believe that we didn t have the other doll - like we were lying or hadn t checked properly. I said they could check CCTV if needs be.

I also read you are going to fine people for parking in parent and child bays too  although some people do take advantage  ive noticed your signs state you can only park there if your child is 5 years and under. However have you considered that some parents may park in the parent and child bays because they have a child  who has a hidden disability or a condition that doesn t qualify for a disabled blue badge. I my self am guilty  i park in a child bay even though it says for children 5 and under. My child is 9 and has disability s but doesn t qualify for a mobility blue badge. When my child is having a melt down or kicking off i appreciate the wider bays purely for the safety of my son and also so he doesn t damage other cars. He isn t naughty and his behavior is not down to bad parenting its due to his condition. I think its unfair you assume once your child is out of a baby car seat the space is no longer needed. Have you considered making bays wider for parents with children under the age of 16. Not necessarily near the front of the store but somewhere within the main car park its self? Children and Adults with hidden disabilities should not be discriminated against. Yours Sincerely  A Parent with a Child who has Hidden Disabilities.;;;;;2016-10-10T20:01:35+0000;1476129695;2016-10-10 22:01:35;1;2;1;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

So I m trying to find bread that has no soya.  So I m looking at your I store baked breads and the only allergen or lists is wheat. I m like great  that was easy. But then I think  No. That s too easy  So a after scouring the store for a tesco person  I finally find a guy in fruit and veg. Poor guy being a fruit and veg guy has no idea if the wholemeal sliced I m hopefully carrying contains soya so he trots off to find someone.  When he does its someone who is obvs off duty cos they are in a coat ect. This poor guy has no idea either  but tells my fruit and veg guy to go downstairs and ask at the bakery. So off he goes to ask with my hoped for loaf of bread  and asks if the bread contains soya.  Which it does. I thank the poor guy and head slowly to the free from section.  So here is my question.  The labels are obvs printed for each item And it obvs has room for allergens cos it states  contains wheat  so why does it not contain a full list of allergens including soya which is in bold on most other items because it s an allergen? It s four letters. Less letters than wheat and would have easily fit on the same line as  contains wheat  there would even be room for a comma. And a full stop. I mean you d going if you can put one on then you could fit the whole list....you know?;;;;;2016-10-10T19:45:32+0000;1476128732;2016-10-10 21:45:32;0;2;1;0;3;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0

Obviously I agree I did wrong parking in a disabled space(sorry my 4 year old had a poorly belly)  however the amount of parent to child spaces is a joke ¬£70 fine.

Netto was a little bit of a different experience but overall cheaper with a surprisingly good selection and choice for shoppers. Since competition opened Tesco seemed to immediately sit up and make an effort  the store was re-vamped  socks seemed to have been pulled up and the shelves were well stocked  not before time...   Netto has since closed to the dismay of many. My real problem is that since your only competitor has closed down your store has really slipped back down again. Yesterday like most other weeks I chose to do my weekly shop at this local store for convenience  how disappointing to see huge gaps on many of the shelves yet again  many items I needed were missing  the shelf labels were there so I knew you were still selling the lines I wanted but so many things were out of stock or just hadn t been filled up  it was a struggle to find staff to ask and just a real let down. I had to go further out of my way to buy the items I needed. I made a concerted effort to use your store  I may as well cut my losses and drive to a different store permanently or even a different supermarket. Tesco you need to sort this out!

Whilst when you have babies the close spots are amazing  what parents really need after the first year is the extra door space. So what if an area towards the edge of your car parks was labelled  extra area  and every other space had hatching (or something) on it so if the car park wasn t packed people parked in every other space. That way you don t lose spaces but people that need the extra space can find it and walk a bit further. This could then be used by older customers that have difficulty but are not disabled and people who have brand new Ferrari s too!

You used to sell them in 400g packets for ¬£2 too so I believed that they were to begin with. Also the store is littered with new tickets stating  ONLY ¬£...

As a consumer I feel it is my duty to make conscientious decisions with regards to what I do and don‚Äôt buy in order to manage my impact on the environment  which is a big deal to me and should be for all of us.   Using your service  I very much appreciate the option to say no to plastic bags and to be able to buy loose fresh produce however this is where my gripe comes in. I purchase loose fruit and veg in order to avoid plastic packaging which cannot be recycled. When I placed my online order with yourselves  under ‚Äòcomments for delivery‚Äô I clearly stated ‚Äúplease use as little plastic packaging as possible‚Äù  yet you can imagine my frustration when my shopping arrived and still I find my single courgette  among others  arrive in individual plastic bags WITHIN a recyclable paper bag. Why is this? I will not accept that it ‚Äòmakes it easier for the cashier‚Äô as a single courgette is handled in exactly the same way  whether in or out of a bag. And I have no doubt that all of your cashiers are more than capable of handling 5 loose apples that are not held neatly together in a bag. To say it makes it easier would be an insult to your staff. I also disbelieve that it may be to protect the vegetable in question  as this plastic bag offers no padding and as I said  they all arrived together in a separate paper bag which could surely do the same job. After that  I am lost for reasons as to why this may be the case and so am disappointed in your staff‚Äôs lack of thought with regards to environmental impact and also a complete lack of regard for their customer‚Äôs requests  which were clearly stated before purchase.   Now  this is not a personal attack at the staff who packed my shopping as I‚Äôm sure they were following protocol set by the company (this is not the first instance). Therefore I am urging you  as a company  to go one step above the rest  and get rid of these unnecessary plastic produce bags completely. Paper bags are provided for mushrooms  why can‚Äôt they be used for all vegetables?  As a large company you have the power to influence and help thousands of other people to make positive changes. Think of the difference that could make  just with one small change. Empower people  don‚Äôt frustrate them by ruining their hard work.   Do not apologise for ‚Äòthis mistake‚Äô or simply thank me for my feedback. Tell me what you are going to do about this issue.

I could understand if he had already scanned a lot of items  but it was only 2 which he could easily have voided then rescanned.  When I suggested this  he IGNORED me and turned away from me! I wasn t rude in the slightest  and his lack of response was completely unnecessary.  If there is a company policy that prevented him doing so  he should have just said so.

Just a quick message with regards to your parents and children parking bays. I live in Ammanford Wales and your store in our town is superb.  My only issue is people using the parent and child bays who have no children or display a disable badge  when the disabled bays are empty.   As a father of 2 children (4 and 12 months) I find your parents bays essential. The wider parking space allows me to safely remove and put my boys back in the car without damaging other parked vehicles whilst ensuring the safety of my children.  The purpose for which you have these bays.   I m really getting fed up of people using the bays who shouldn t be  but it ppears nothing is being done about it.  I have told staff on site but nothing ever appears to be actioned.   If it s evening and all the bays are free then it s no problem using one to pop in or use the cash point. But when it s busy  what can be done about it?  I d like to see a sign that states parents can use the disabled bays and vice versa IF THEIR OWN BAYS ARE FULL.  What are your views on this? In the big scheme of things it may seem trivial to others but to parents I belive it s an important issue that deserves consideration.  Every little helps? I honestly  hope so. Many thanks for your time in reading this. Andy.;;;;;2016-10-09T07:50:08+0000;1475999408;2016-10-09 09:50:08;1;3;2;1;6;3;2;1;2;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;0

I haven t been in since and probably never will. I bought a Sony Experia from the Oakham Store some months ago and then three weeks ago it refused to switch on leaving me without a phone. I am a taxi driver and so went to the store to see if anything could be done. Nothing could according to the staff I saw there and was told I would have to take it to get repaired and so I bought another cheap mobile to get me by as it was and is my livelihood. A couple of days later I rang customer service and a lady by the name of Hannah said she could help me out and over the phone gave me instructions as to what was probably wrong and explained what to do. This was totally successful and my Sony is now perfect again. When I explained to her I had bought another phone to get me by she told me to go back to the store and they would probably refund me the ¬£25 it cost. This I did only to be told by a woman on Customer Service  and I quote  If you want your money back I suggest you take your phone back to the person who told you to bring it here  and ask her for it  That is where the conversation with this person in Oakham ended. I wasn t over bothered about the ¬£25 but I was flabbergasted at the rudeness of the comment. If she didn t want to give me a refund that is fine. There are ways of dealing with customers though  and I am sure this isn t one of them. Consequently  she has lost Tesco a customer.;;;;;2016-10-08T20:37:12+0000;1475959032;2016-10-08 22:37:12;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Finding food in the reduced section but the staff haven t reduced some of it.  Also when second reductions are done. Not all of the going out of date food is been reduced again.  Also identical items end up with different prices.  When I asked about this. The staff member was rude and just went off with the food.

I went in on Friday around 6pm with my children  and as I m trying to encourage my 10 year old autistic son social and communicative skills  he went up to customer services to get some flowers wrapped. Now usually we would be rushed through these opportunities with very little interaction  and child centred approach to conversations  this young gentleman was so patient  kind and gave my son perfect opportunities to facilitate his conversing skills  he gave him full attention  asked him questions  got to his level and made it a really positive experience for him. It s the little things like this that pave the way to positive interactions and build confidence and self esteem to such children who perhaps struggle in situations we take for granted.  I only know his name was Ben (which my son is also Ben which naturally made his day) he helped on customer services but was in a Tesco Mobile uniform and usually on that department. Thank you Ben!

When we got home and checked the receipt we found we had been charged for 3 bunches of flowers when we only bought 2. We also purchased 2 packs of picture hanging strips that had been reduced from ¬£4 each to ¬£1.50 a pack  we were charged full price for them both. I phoned the store and in a very rushed call I was told to take my receipt back in to store. I asked if I could uses a more local store to us to sort the problem but unfortunately I was told this was not possible. On Monday we returned to Hemsworth and was given a refund for the flower over charge and our money back for the picture strips  not given them at the reduced price they were marked at  your colleague took the items from us and refunded our money. We weren t offered so much as an apology for being over charged almost ¬£10 never mind something towards our diesel costs or our time  in fact your colleague found it funny and laughed as she said she hoped this wasn t our first experience at shopping with Tesco! It wasn t our first  but if this is how a company like yours treats it s customers  it will be our last!;;;;;2016-10-08T16:41:55+0000;1475944915;2016-10-08 18:41:55;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Whilst I m all for this (if its true)  I m concerned that they are completely overlooking pregnant women.   I m 8 months pregnant and whilst walking and having enough energy to shop is difficult enough at that stage  I also suffer from severe pelvic girdle pain and am on crutches. I have had a couple people make comments when I have parked at my local tesco in the parents bays because I don t always have my 5 year old with me  or shoot me dirty looks before I even get out of my car based on assumptions.    Many of your competitors make it clear that parents spaces are also welcome to be used by expectant mothers - I have on more than one occasion gone there instead to avoid the hassle at tesco.   If you could recognise expectant mothers as part of parents welcome to park on parent bays this would be welcome in my opinion -particularly if you are looking to start fining people. It s very difficult for women at that stage to have energy or stamina to go to the store and  every little helps!   even if it s a small gesture like making pregnant women feel more welcome.    If pregnant women aren t welcome to park in parent bays  why not? Yiu cannot assume that every pregnant woman is able bodied and even the underground has bump badges so women don t have to ask for a seat or be made to feel uncomfortable.    Pelvic girdle pain is actually given temporary blue badges at some councils and there is a movement to recognise this across more areas - and up to 20% of women suffer this in pregnancy. So please bear in mind this demographic before you start letting unsympathetic employees give penalty fines and generally make sire that they are aware that not every disability is visible either!!   Just because someone can walk doesn t mean they don t suffer ulcerative colitis  crohns  fibromyalgia   or some other illness that means they are disabled.  I hope you have thought through exactly how employees would be equipped with the judgement before they send across pictures to the parking enforcers for fines - staff in customer services generally need up skilling on equality and diversity and you could be opening a massive can of worms.;;;;;2016-10-08T16:28:58+0000;1475944138;2016-10-08 18:28:58;2;8;4;0;12;4;2;2;2;0;2;1;0;1;0;0;0

Went shopping there today and my 5yr old helped himself to a piece of free fruit which he chose an apple however when he bit into it the apple was wrotten which made my son spit it out straight aay and was very upset. I took the apple to customer services which the lady said sorry and left it at that. As I walked back to where my son was standing with my mum a gentleman walked out of the staff private area and I asked for a cup of water so my son could get rid of the taste of apple which the gentleman got and asked if everything was ok when I explained what happened he got down to my son s level and asked if he was ok and offered him a free bag of sweets. I was expecting a pack of sweets however the bloke returned with a multipack of haribo to say sorry. Unfortunately I didn t get the blokes name but he was fantastic and when I saw him again in store he asked again if my son was ok.

I ve just had the run around looking for the  Speak Out Game  at your Merthyr and Aberdare stores. Tesco direct shows that they are in both stores. I popped to Merthyr last night and the shelf with the ticket on was empty  it has been for around a week now. I asked on customer services and the gent informed me that there were 8 in stock and popped to the warehouse to see if he could find any  he didn t have much luck but asked me to pop in when someone on the department was there to have a good look.  In the meantime I popped to the aberdare store as I thought it may be easier and it showed the game was in stock according to the website. When I got there  there wasn t even a ticket for the item  the store assistant wasn t much help and just palmed it off as not being put on display yet. I then returned to the Merthyr Tesco  I advised the assistant that I was told by customer services that there were 8 in stock but the shelves have been empty for days. The advisor told me she d been through most of the crates this morning and if it wasn t there it wasn t there  after reiterating that customer services said last night there was 8 in stock she went to the warehouse  again to no avail.  I m quite disappointed not so much by the customer service  but at the fact you obviously seem to have some stock issues in both stores and the fact that some colleagues are not even bothered by the discrepancy in the store systems and the actual stock levels... I hope that you will feed this back to both stores as obviously there is something going amiss and they can then take the relevant measures to resolve the issues.   Unfortunately  someone will not be getting the game as a birthday gift off me due to this issue but hopefully you can prevent it happening to others!;;;;;2016-10-08T14:33:35+0000;1475937215;2016-10-08 16:33:35;1;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Basically I went to Gatwick tesco last week to buy a TV  got the TV home in a taxi safely And there was a leak in the screen. I took the TV back to tesco walked it all the way the top floor at the back of the store for an exchange for the same TV   The staff was quiet blunt and rude! I was then asked to go back to the bottom floor front of the store to get another tv (no staff was offered for help with this big tv)  by the time I got back upstairs with tv I was only then informed all these tvs kept being returned for faults and would I like to look for one at the same size?  I them went to find a third tv however there were none for the same size at the same price only one that was the same size but ¬£20 more..  I then carried a 3rd to the counter again with no help from staff. Just my mother who is quiet poorly herself! I paid the extra and carried this tv to the taxi  To now find out I also have to return to the store to return this 3rd tv due to a fault with the software on the apps as it s unfit for purpose. I would like to know what s going on with all the TVs and the rudeness from the staff??  Thankyou will look forward to a reply;;;;;2016-10-08T13:13:21+0000;1475932401;2016-10-08 15:13:21;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I hear you are planning to have you staff monitor disabled parking spaces for unbadged and illicit use. This is at the same time both a correct and generous act as the level of misuse these days is becoming intolerable. Just this morning I was at a rival supermarket and saw a large Mercedes being parked in a disabled bay and the young woman who got out (wearing running shoes) walked rapidly into the store  showing no hint of disability at all  nor displaying a blue badge. Frankly it is acts such as this that now encourage me to support your store if you in turn are supporting disabled people. For your information this may be repeated as word is already travelling amongst disabled groups in social media. Thank you.;;;;;2016-10-08T12:23:11+0000;1475929391;2016-10-08 14:23:11;0;7;0;0;7;7;6;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

There s a massive generator parked over two parking spaces with a massive power cable going past the entrance doors. Easily a tripping hazard. Trolleys in the middle of the parking spaces.

Might I suggest that you employ enough staff to open enough tills to service the queue in a timely manner and to also inform your staff of the legalities of the sale of alcohol which would have allowed them to serve me under the circumstances.  I wouldn t be so irked but your staff weren t even trained enough to feign an apology and to make eye contact rather than staring at my rather cool hat (The last point may be my fault).

I went into your store on Sinclaire Street in Helensburgh today with my 15 year old autistic son. On entering I noted there were woman wearing  stand up to cancer  packing bags at the checkouts. ( A very worthy cause).  The store was quite busy and my son was showing signs of becoming anxious early on. By the time we reached the checkout he was gripping at his ears  lashing out and starting to shake. This is where your Helensburgh team really showed they re worth their weight in gold!  Whilst in the line a staff member asked if he could help in any way. I explained the issues my son was having. He went to the bag packer and quietly explained  and then he and the bag packer walked away from the till without saying a word. The lady on the checkout ( Margaret) put the  till closing  sign on and asked me very quietly if I needed bags or a hand packing. As I was holding my son she took my shopping from me and loaded it onto the conveyor belt  and packed it away. No fuss  no song and dance  just gentle grace. I paid and thanked her and left the shop. On leaving the sign was removed  Margaret had more customers pass through her checkout and the bag packer returned to her task. I managed to leave with my son in shut down mode NOT melt down. I didn t have to ditch my shopping and leave without my groceries. I didn t have to restrain him. I didn t have to lift him from the floor.  May not seem a big deal to some  but to me this was the best service from any store ever. The staff just knew what to do. I can not thank you enough!;;;;;2016-10-07T20:42:30+0000;1475872950;2016-10-07 22:42:30;23647;950;26279;1630;28859;940;887;53;518;0;23418;2434;155;6;4;1;0

I ordered a toy from your online sale and at the checkout was given the option of standard delivery or paying extra for specific day delivery. It was my nieces birthday  so decided to pay extra for specific day delivery  to ensure it arrived on time. My parcel did not arrive!! I contacted Tesco via email to ask where my order was  I had no response for a couple of days! Today I received an email with a full refund with no explanation. After telling my niece she still had a gift to arrive I now have to tell her it s not coming or try and find it else where!!

I placed an order for home delivery on Sat 1st October - order number 601566906  It was ordered to delivered between 7 & 8pm on Sunday 2nd October at 19.33 on Sunday I received 2 texts to say my order had been delayed the first said it would be delivered between 21.05 & 21.50 and the second one said it would be delivered between 19.00 and 21.51.  At 21.22 I rang the customer service department for an update where I was told that my driver had one more delivery before mine and they would be with me no later than 22.00.  As a gesture of good will they would send me a voucher - which they did for ¬£7.00.  It is now 23.50 on a Sunday evening and I still haven t received my shopping  I am now going to have to get up early in the morning and go shopping to buy my children s pack lunch items - at an extra cost to myself  as this should of all been delivered.  This is totally unacceptable  I have not been kept informed of anything since 19.33 this evening  and no one has told me that my shopping isn t actually going to arrive.   I would also like more than a ¬£7 voucher for the inconvenience.

Please look into this as a matter of urgency.

At 8.30pm my partner rang tesco (colchester) to be told our shopping had been delivered & signed for. It had NOT been delivered to our address so it was clear the driver had delivered it to the wrong address. After an hour of constantly being on hold etc  we were then told nothing could be done tonight & we would have to wait till tomorrow. We explained that we need our food because our 4 year old daughter needs breakfast & lunch for school tomorrow. No one cared. We were told nothing could be done because the shopping had been signed for which WASN T by neither of us. None of this is our fault  & it feels like we are being punished. My partner then questioned whether he could go to the store & collect our shopping & they said no. He then asked if it could be delivered  they said no. The woman on the phone was very difficult to deal with  awful customer service. We are owed ¬£50 worth of shopping. We have NO money now due to you withdrawing the money  & NO shopping. This is absolutely disgusting. We cannot afford to fund someone else s cupboards & fridge.

For at least 6 weeks I ve been trying to get hold of your Free From Tiger Rolls.   You can t imagine how delighted I was to see that I could add them to my order for delivery this evening... they ve always previously been unavailable.  I was so excited  I showed my colleague and informed her that I was going to rush home to make soup to have with my crusty rolls.  Which I did.   When my order arrived  the rolls were missing...  not available .  Please can you tell me if the Free From Tiger Rolls exist? Or are they mythical creatures like unicorns? Or are they real  but evasive and fleeting  like my happiness after my gluten intolerance diagnosis? Where can I find them?  I just need to know whether to give up this hope.  Jade  P.S. Your Free From range is amaze balls and thanks for getting GF Betty Crocker. My mate Debbie and I love your Angel Slices. They re kind of like vanilla and pink brownies.;;;;;2016-10-06T18:55:43+0000;1475780143;2016-10-06 20:55:43;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

After using the tablet for nearly 3 weeks  I came across a news item online regarding a recall of Amazon Fire tablet power adapters due to risk of electrocution.  The recall was back in March so I was suprised that my new tablet was supplied with one of the faulty power adapters.  As tablets are still being sold with the faulty power adapters  I would expect Tesco to advise their customers that they need to obtain a replacement power adapter from Amazon free of charge.  Details of the recall are on the Tesco website with the advise that the original adapter should not be used. I ve twice tried to post a review of the tablet on the Tesco website to alert other purchasers to this issue but my reviews have been rejected.;;;;;2016-10-06T17:30:37+0000;1475775037;2016-10-06 19:30:37;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I called in  to your Newton-le-Willows/Earlestown store  a few days ago and you had a display complete with games. I picked one up and took it to the till. I was told  after queuing-up  that I couldn t pay for it there and that I needed to go to the cigarette kiosk/click & collect desk - as that s where the games are kept (which seemed fine to me  except for the massive queue  which was being served by one person and that nearly everyone in the queue  aside from myself and some children (also buying FIFA 17)  were cigarette buyers/smokers - i.e. largely stinking of stale cigarette smoke). It took ten minutes to get to the front of the queue. It was at this point  that things really started to take a dark turn. FIFA 17 wasn t in stock for PS4. No explanation was offered as to why the FIFA17 for PS4 boxes were still on the shelves  let alone on a prime location display. Today  I thought I d try again. I called ahead to check FIFA 17 was in stock. I was told there were loads [of copies] (for PS4) on the shelves. I called in. I queued up (this time at the stinky-queued kiosk immediately). I was psyched and excited  finally I thought - only to be told it was out of stock again. A little annoyed  I questioned why the PS4 version boxes were on the shelves - I got a slight apology  and the games were taken down. Now things wouldn t be too bad  except for the fact that  two minutes away from TESCO  on my way home  at a traffic-light I wouldn t have been at - if not for visiting TESCO  some children threw a milkshake at me  which rather completely covered me and my motorbike.   So  my question to you  TESCO  is  is this just some round-about way of sending me a message that you don t want me to play FIFA 17?  - A supremely disappointed (& miffed) Pete;;;;;2016-10-05T17:57:59+0000;1475690279;2016-10-05 19:57:59;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I m writing to ask you what the hell is happening with your  ideas  wo/man (although juding by some of the combinations I have seen  it ideas could be being drawn out of a hat by a cat at random and fused together.)  I ve seen crisps with a myriad of weird combinations  dark chocolate and red chilli sausages  parsnip crisps with honey paprika  prosecco and elderberry crisps are just to name a few.  Today  I was shopping in one of your stores with my son  Lil Jabari  when I saw a box of  Glittery Shortbread  and I thought I was dreaming... please would you look into your ideas team/pack as it seems they re either having some kind of mid-life crisis or that they are taking some seriously mind-bending psychedelics.

I purchased a bed through your website with one of your partner company s  Comfy Living. They intially delivered two of three required boxes 13 days ago. Today after the third day of promising by Comfy Living that the missing box Would be delivered it has not been. It s safe to say Comfy Living could care less and every time we speak To them they just lie to our faces that the item Will be delivered. Today I was assured it would be here by 2.30. Then 3.30 and now at 4.16 there is still no bed and all the company could say was  it s the couriers fault. They are essentially holding me hostage. My daughter is sleeping on the floor  I haven t the money to replace the bed and they have no intention of Delivering it. How is this acceptable Tesco? That you give this company a platform to treat your customers Like this? I will not be using Tesco for anything again. I urge everyone to avoid Comfy Living at all costs. They are inept at best and liars at worse. I am gutted for my daughter.

Yesterday around 12:30pm just before leaving the store I had returned an item  I then walked around looking at a few products such as make-up. I had also purchased some snacks. After paying for my items I walked towards the exit to leave the store  however the alarm went off and I was immediately stopped by two male security guards. They requested to look through my belongings and they had asked me to empty my bag within the front store open to the public. Firstly they were not allowed to search me in front of the public. They in fact had to do a search behind closed doors. After the security guards found nothing they continued to accuse me and asked what make-up did I ‚Äòsteal‚Äô. In shock I explained exactly what I done within the store  I had returned an item  looked at a few products for a short period of time followed by purchasing some snacks. I expressed that I did not steal anything as it is not in my nature to do such a thing. A friend of mine had come entered the store and saw what was going on  he insisted on helping me and he was also shocked that they would make such accusations. After thoroughly searching my bag the security guards were still not satisfied so they therefore called for another security guard who had then escorted me and my friend to an isolated room where they could do a further search. I felt so embarrassed and they made me feel so petite. I could not believe that they would accuse me of stealing. Stealing or being dishonest is something that is not in my heart and I would never even consider the thought of stealing anything from anyone. I am a hard working and a religious girl. I was in tears that they had continued to accuse me.   After bringing me to an isolated room  another male security guard had further searched my bag  belongings and my jacket. I felt even more embarrassed that a male security guard would go through my belongings especially that I am a female and I carry around products for female and personal reasons. After their second attempt to search me they found nothing  however they still continued to accuse me of stealing ‚Äúmake-up‚Äù  they asked ‚Äúwhere did you put the make-up‚Äù they also stated that it was a white item. In tears I continued to express that I would never steal anything. For almost the fifth time I explained that I had returned an item and the only thing that I had placed within my own bag was the receipt from the item I had returned. They stated that they monitored me throughout my time in the store  so there is no way they could assume that I would place a stolen item elsewhere. They came to realisation that I did not steal an item and they were willing to let me go  I was so upset  disappointed and frustrated that I wanted to make a complaint for how unprofessional this situation was dealt with. The security guard called in the store manager ‚ÄòHus‚Äô  after he assessed the video he also accused me of stealing an item. My friend was just as frustrated and shocked as myself; therefore he requested to see the security footage. The security guards and the store manager ‚ÄòHus‚Äô allowed my friend to view the security footage. After my friend watched the security footage he did notice that I had put something into my bag  he immediately expressed that it does not look anything like an item or a product whatsoever  in fact he agreed that it was a paper material ‚Äòthe receipt‚Äô that I had continuously expressed to the security guards. My friend was so frustrated that they had wasted our time for making the biggest mistake. The manager ‚ÄòHus‚Äô and security guards were very opinionated that a product was stolen. The ‚Äòmanager‚Äô stated that they would normally inform the police to do a search. My response from the very beginning was to inform the police  I told them many times to call a female police officer to do another full search. I had no problems whatsoever with informing the police. I know how valuable a police officer‚Äôs time is  and if they did call the police they would have wasted their time too. The manager was willing to let us go as they could not find a product that they thought was stolen.   The manager ‚ÄòHus‚Äô did apologise to an extent that this was a misunderstanding on their behalf. At this point I felt relieved that he was taking ownership for their mistakes  however he made a very sarcastic comment by saying ‚Äúin my opinion  it looks like you have picked up a product and placed it into your bag.‚Äù I then realised that he did not mean his apology as he continued to accuse me. I felt even more upset. The two security guards did not want to acknowledge that they were in the wrong and not at any point did they want to take ownership for their mistakes. To top this off and to make things even more embarrassing a crowd of ‚ÄòTesco‚Äô employees from different departments were standing and watching from outside the room I was interrogated in. The door was wide open for the employees to watch and pretend as if they were doing work in a security office. This was very irrelevant  unprofessional and shameful. The feeling was even more unbearable. After me and my friend were free to leave  as there was no stolen item and I was undoubtedly innocent. As I walked out I felt so out of place that they had accused me of being a criminal. After I was searched I left with the exact same items that I had purchased and all my belongings that I brought into the store. After passing through the security ‚Äòalarm‚Äô by the exit  no alarms had gone off  they therefore intentionally turned on the alarms from when I was previously leaving the store. It made no sense  for someone to steal a make-up product there is no doubt that the alarms will go off. This therefore justifies that I did not steal anything.   After leaving the store I had called Tesco‚Äôs head office to make a complaint. I spoke to a kind lady and I thoroughly addressed my complaint expressing every detail possible. She immediately apologised for what had happened and she had agreed that this was very unprofessional. She also informed me that something will be done about this  as this is not the service Tesco provide. She insisted that she will get down to the bottom of this situation and contact me as soon as possible. It has been 24 hours and I still await for her call. I will now be contacting the ‚Äòombudsman‚Äô to make a further complaint.  I am extremely dissatisfied with how this was dealt with. It was very unprofessional  and I felt so embarrassed about what had happened. Tesco Extra in Goodmayes is my local grocery store  I shop there on a weekly basis and sometimes I come in as often as a five times per week. I have a lot of  family  friends and work colleagues who also shop at Tesco‚Äôs. A work colleague of mine also saw what had happened. I was so embarrassed that I did not go into work today as everyone will know what happened in the event that took place yesterday. Although I did nothing wrong I would never want people I know to even think that I would ever committee such a disgusting crime. The event that happened yesterday has left me so upset that I no longer feel comfortable shopping at Tesco‚Äôs Goodmayes. Firstly due to the security guards and the manager for how they treated me  also the random employees who decided to watch and for those I personally know who may have saw the incident.   As a customer I did not feel as if I was respected by the security guards or the manager ‚ÄòHus‚Äô. Never could I imagine I would receive such poor and unprofessional behaviour from Tesco‚Äôs and its employees  one of the leading stores in the UK.";;;;;2016-10-05T15:16:33+0000;1475680593;2016-10-05 17:16:33;1;2;1;0;3;2;1;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Definitely more emphasis should be given to the disabled bay signs.  Often there is not one to spare because non-disabled people prefer to use them because they are close to the store and there is no deterrent if they use them.

At 5.10pm called to check upon the whereabouts of the order and after being promised a call back  which never happened  I called again at approximately 6pm to be told that the driver could not find the address  did not ring me on my mobile number detailed on the order and returned the Berwick store. I requested the order be cancelled and a refund be actioned.  I was advised this would take 3-4 working days.  I did receive a call from the store late morning on Sunday 25 September stating that they may be able to delivery in the afternoon/evening  despite my instruction the previous evening to cancel and refund the order.  Again I requested the order be cancelled and refund and was advised it would take 5-7 working days to refund?  Sent an email to this effect to your Customer Service on Monday 3/10/16 and received a call earlier this afternoon to say that the refund had never be actioned but it would now and could take another 3-5 days?   I have to say that I have been very disappointed at the service received at this time.  I have placed several grocery orders  over the last 5-6 years  that have been delivered to remote addresses and have had no problems/delays until now.  Due to the appalling bad service received  for any future food deliveries  we will NOT be using Tesco again!!!!

I thought it was because of the environment and landfill and plastic bags not being bio degradable!

It was a weekly shop for my household of 5 so it was pretty big!  Now my normal weekly shop i manage to get in about 5-6 reusable shopping bags. Whilst putting my shopping in the car i couldnt help but think it was packed in alot of bags!  When i got home i counted the bags  some of which only had one item in them  there was 28 bags in total!  Now i dont care about paying 5p for a bag its not about that its more about the fact the government put in this rule to stop us wasting and harming the environment but what penalty is there for big companies like tesco over using the plastic bags! I mean 28 plastic bags and at least 10 of them had one item in!

Bearing in mind one of the orders was a replacement of an original order which arrived swathed in bubblewrap yet the box was so battered it was rendered completely useless as a gift!!! I think I ll be taking our custom elsewhere in future!!;;;;;2016-10-04T20:09:06+0000;1475611746;2016-10-04 22:09:06;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

On Sunday I ordered a LEGO Classic Large Creative Box 10697 from Tesco to collect from my local Tesco garage.  I was told both before and after the order:  You can collect your order after 3pm on 3/10/2016.    I received an email at 06:24 on the 3rd saying  We have just dispatched your order 4D4G6HMYF.   I drove to the garage immediately after work  but when I got there at about 16.45  the member of staff rumaged around in the storeroom and came back saying that they could not trace the package  and that I would need to phone customer services.  When I got back home I phoned customer services and spoke to an assistant called Mohammed. I explained what had happened  and he was courteous and polite.  He checked with the courier company s website and said that Tesco had failed given the courier the package. I pointed out that at no point had Tesco contacted me to tell me the package was not actually on the way and that I had had a thirty minute round journey in vain.  He apologised for (as he put it) the cowardice of Tesco s not informing me that the packet was not on the way and offered to send another packet  but now that it was after 5pm he could not promise that it would arrive today (the 4th).    I have received no further email and looked at the website this evening and still can only see the original dispatch on the 3rd.  I am not planning on driving over to the garage tonight in the vain hope that it has arrived undocumented.  I can only hope it will arrive tomorrow  because my son keeps on asking where it is.  This is not the first time.  A couple of years ago they claimed to have left a crate of wine in my garden  which never came (and they could not describe where they had left it)  then when they tried again  they claimed noone was in  even though I had stayed in all day  so I assume on both occasions the delivery driver went to some other address.  As I told Mohammed  if I don t get the Lego tomorrow  I shall try to find it locally and shall send them the bill.  Tesco offers a good discount  so it will end up more expensive  but it is the only reasonable way that I can have my contract with them fulfilled.  Hopefully it will not come to that and if it does hopefully they will pay up immediately rather than forcing me to escalate the complaint up the management chain  though the ombudsman  and ultimately through the small claims process. It is shameful to give such shoddy service  especially for products that they must know children are likely to be looking forward to.;;;;;2016-10-04T19:37:08+0000;1475609828;2016-10-04 21:37:08;0;5;0;0;5;5;2;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am referring to the Tesco Express store in Uplands  Swansea  SA2 0EY where I shop regularly. Today I went in to buy a few top up shopping needs and was pulled aside by a lady who works there regularly who told me the duty manager wanted to speak to me about some unpaid goods. I was a bit incredulous about this to start with as I am a very honest person  not that this should make the blindest bit of difference to the situation. The duty manager came out and said that I had only paid for half of my shopping on a previous in store occasion. Apparently the cashier had put through that I had paid half in cash and half on my card and I had dishonestly not made them aware of this. I would wholeheartedly agree that it would be unusual  though not unheard of  for me to pay half my bill in cash and half on card  but I would never not correct a mistake of this kind. In fact there have been previous occasions when I have corrected the cashier for undercharging me. The duty manager couldn t tell me when this allegedly happened  but said he would show me a receipt to prove it had happened. After leafing through papers for a good five minutes  he told me that he had been unable to find the offending receipt and that I was free to go.  I was really offended that this entire exchange played out in front of a shop full of people  many of whom I knew. I was accused of having done something dishonest without the slightest bit of proof. I ve shopped in this store for two years  probably spending in excess of ¬£75 per week and I m completely put off visiting again. The service has never been good there- it s not unheard of to spend five minutes waiting for alcohol purchases to be authorised  to be told to just use the self service machines if the girl behind the counter is restocking cigarettes  to have to navigate around the orders that always seem to be put away during the morning and evening rush hour etc  but this has really upset me.  May I suggest that if this incident even happened in the first place that the store firstly takes responsibility for their cashier s mistake and further to this  if they do want to pursue it with me that they have  the evidence  to hand instead of making me wait red faced in front of a shop of my acquaintances having essentially been accused of stealing. I am an honest person- had I realised I had been undercharged I would have mentioned it  but if it did happen the way they allege it did  it was certainly without my realising.   I m really disappointed. You would expect better customer service from a retail giant like Tesco.;;;;;2016-10-04T19:23:58+0000;1475609038;2016-10-04 21:23:58;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

She brought my 3 items back (eventually) and scanned them  but then refused to give me one of the packages as she couldn t find my name anywhere on it (even tho she got it from the store with my name on it) spent the next 30 minutes looking for another package (no idea why when she had opened said package and it had my order in it) she then collared another woman who also looked for my package in the cupboards and in the back store (all while my package was sat behind the desk that deb had refused to give me) then eventually came back checked the package behind the desk saw that it did in fact have my name on and gave me it! No apology no nothing! All this happened with me repeatedly asking for the package that I had already ordered and paid for which was sat behind the counter and telling them I needed to leave to collect my son from school and was met with being completely ignored!

It s bad enough when you mix your metric units on a single product. for example Kg and Grams on the cheese. But most people can work that one out! But it s still not good as there are a few people who can t even do that type of simple arithmetic.   However I just went in to Milton Cambridge Tesco and was surprised to find grapes  one packaging marked with the price per Kg and a different packaging marked in imperial pounds and ounces.  Now if I was the type of person to be cynical I would think it s a con to make the larger package seem to be less expensive as I suspect trading standards would.  My mental arithmetic does not run to converting metric to imperial weight  Ask around your office and see if any of you can?   When did we stop teaching imperial units in school?? I left school in 1971 and we were using metric then.  You really need to get this sorted and have a common unit for at least the same products. In the ideal world you should have everything displayed with a price per Kg or gm.;;;;;2016-10-04T17:33:48+0000;1475602428;2016-10-04 19:33:48;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Firstly she went to your store in Leith  Edinburgh   where she was told they were not sent in the mini binders but had the cards  so she got the cards and was told to go another branch. She then went out to your store in Corstorphine to be told by a rude member of staff that they were not sent in there either to get then told it states while stocks last where my family member said yes that s right but you need to be sent them first for that to happen. After spending money on bus fares to these 2 stores she wasn t travelling any further. My question is why negotiate a deal for an offer that we cannot get cos you did not send the binders into the stores. They were large extra stores she went too. Is there anywhere that does have these that she can go get as it is for my son. I look forward to a prompt reply since we have cards but no binder!

I cannot fault the customer care I received from your transport manager Marcus  as he dealt with the situation well and took full responsibility of the accident and gave clear instructions to both me and the driver to resolve the issue of my damaged car.   It took the company 2 weeks from this date to come and collect my car for repair. As promised I received a courtesy car  which was supposed to be a like for like comparison to my car (Honda jazz). I received a 4 seater smart car. This car is very small and is not very spacious at all. The two back seats are only able to fit children.  This has made it very difficult to make trips in this car  as I have a disabled sister and a mum who suffers from arthritis  neither of which can sit in the back of the car without causing pain or discomfort. I have therefore had to rearrange plans and rely on taxis  or friends and family for lifts out. I drove the car to do my weekly shop and put my shopping in the boot. I was not made aware when given the car that the engine was under the boot space and this would become warm when driving  resulting in me loosing most of my frozen goods bought on that day. Furthermore the smart car I currently have is now due a service and does not have any screen wash in. I would expect all this to be checked before lending out the car.  The GC South company that have taken my car for repair have now had my car for 12 days and not once updated me on the progress of the repairs. I had to phone them myself on 28th September to ask how much longer it would be for the repairs to my car will be complete as an email I received stated that the completion date is the 29th September. I still have not received my car and it is 3rd October. My car is due in for a mot in 7 days‚Äô time and I cannot book it in until I can guarantee I have received my car back.   All this would not be so much of an issue if I only had this car for a short amount of time  but it has now been a 4 weeks and 3 days since the incident happened and it has not been dealt with very quickly  causing great inconvenience and stress.   I have also tried talking to people in your bursledon store who said they will look into things and contact me by 6pm tonight as to when I will receive my car back and why no one is communicating with each other and myself but this also hasn t happened!   I look forward to hearing from you about this. Kerry Harder;;;;;2016-10-03T22:33:26+0000;1475534006;2016-10-04 00:33:26;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

(It is OK when using the normal tills). Out of principle I took my receipts (3 in total) into Infirmary Road  Sheffield branch to be credited.  I was served by a pleasant young guy.  Whilst adding my points I asked is it normal that the self-service tills don‚Äôt accept my clubcard and why this would be the case.  Straight away an old woman (store manager I believe who was watching over the young guy rudely interrupted and chirped in we can only do 2 receipts at a time. I explained my situation to her and she accused me of being fraudulent (even though the last receipt was only for 1 point!! Again it‚Äôs principle and more over I would like to have known why my card is not working correctly.) The woman  who identified herself as Karen Jackson said it wasn‚Äôt her problem and I should revisit the stores I can‚Äôt use my clubcard at and ask them.  Now presently I‚Äôm living in Sheffield so to drive to Dundee store is 320 miles then onto Glossop store is 297 miles and back to where I am staying is 25 miles  totalling 642 miles.  I charge 45 pence /mile totalling ¬£288.90.  I am an Airline captain and my daily rate is ¬£450 per day  which I believe the whole journey will take about a day to complete.  I also charge ¬£5 for lunch and ¬£15 for an evening meal.  Could you please arrange for a cheque to be sent totalling ¬£758.90 so I complete as requested by your employee Karen Jackson.  This besides I still believe after my journey it will be no clearer why my clubcard does not work whenever I‚Äôm not interfacing with a human. I find the rudeness and lack of customer care represented by Karen Jackson to fall well short of that expected by a huge international company.  I have not experienced such shortfalls with Sainsburys  Morrison and Waitrose and their loyalty stores cards have always worked as intended.;;;;;2016-10-03T20:19:35+0000;1475525975;2016-10-03 22:19:35;2;8;2;0;10;8;3;5;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Monday mornings are always a bit stressful when you r a busy mum of 3 and extras (I m a childminder).  Whilst fishing around in my bag earlier on today for that elusive pound coin and with a 1 year old attached to my hip a lovely trolley girls came up to me and asked if I needed any help. My reply being  I m fine I just need to pop inside to get change for the trolley . Her reply   No need to do that I can unlock the trolley for you .  Something so small to others made a huge difference to my morning!! With baby all secured in the trolley we walk straight to the fruit and veg where the baby spotted the bananas . This being her favourite word at the moment as well as  yellow  she repeatedly told me what they were in a very excited manner. A lovely manager who was in the process of restocking as led me if she liked bananas which I replied yes too. He then took the time to look through the pre packed bananas   opened them and offered me the bunch to pick one for her. There were loose ones on the stand but were obviously  the ones that people had left so rather than offering me one of those which still would have been a lovely gesture he hunted for a fresher bunch!! These two kind gestures together made what was normally quite a stressful experience on a Monday morning a lot more pleasurable !!!  Thankyou Tesco St. Mellons for doing that little bit extra and brightening up my day!!!! :-) :-);;;;;2016-10-03T17:36:05+0000;1475516165;2016-10-03 19:36:05;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

How come you you can debit my bank account BEFORE you deliver any goods to my house as part of an online order  but when that delivery fails and no recovery action is carried out  it takes 3working days for the money to come back?

I picked it up from the shelf (where there was no price tag) and took it to the self serve with all my other shopping.  Firstly  the bar code wouldn t scan so had to wait ages to actually be noticed by a member of staff. She then took it out of the protective case and it still wouldn t scan. The system  didn t recognise this item . She said would call someone else to assist us but after waiting around 15/20 minutes of standing at the self serve she eventually flagged someone down and asked about the CD.   She came back and told us she couldn t sell it to us as she didn t know the price. We queried this but she took the CD away and just said we couldn t have it  depsite being nurmourous copies on the shelf and it being released the previous Friday.    Surely there is a system in place  some kind of inventory/stock system like most retail establishments where the item can be searched for to find the price. Surely even a quick search on their own website would have helped them find the price. But sadly  they didn t even bother to check this. It was easier for them to not sell us the CD than it would be to go and check the price.   So after waiting for maybe 25 at this point  we were then not able to buy the CD (which was one of the main reasons for coming into Tescos today). This also seems pretty unfair for the band in question  who will now not be able to have a sale for their CD and this could affect their position in the charts.  I really do hope this issue is sorted as the customer service was poor  we barely got an apology for our wait and the staff didn t seem to care that we weren t able to leave with our product  just told a  No  you can t have this . Begs the question of why even display this item at all if you won t let anyone purchase it? I m sure the CD we were denied went straight back on the shelf and no one took the time to find out the price or take them off the shelves to stop this happening again.;;;;;2016-10-03T15:46:09+0000;1475509569;2016-10-03 17:46:09;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

It was particularly rotten. I did know about this as it had been posted on one my local Facebook selling site and there was a lot of nice comments about her.  I also work in retail and as a new mum sometimes just a smile from the lady in Tesco makes your day when you might be having quite a tough one. I always try my best in my job to do this as you never know what a smile can do. As you say every little helps. Well Sara does this every day.

They know I have to shop with them now and wont go elsewhere because I have already paid them.  It s a shocking service and I won t be renewing next year.  There are many other supermarkets that deliver.;;;;;2016-10-03T13:19:50+0000;1475500790;2016-10-03 15:19:50;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I recognise this is a problem across the clothing industry  but change needs to start somewhere and you have a very powerful voice! Girls and boys alike need clothing which is practical for them to be able to run and play  and feel that their ideas and dreams are respected regardless of their gender. I work with pre-school children  and fighting those stereotypes is so hard when they re constantly being reinforced by clothing and toy marketing in the media and in big stores such as yours. I d love to see such a big company take a stand and get the ball rolling on this much needed change!   #standwithdaisy #amightygirl;;;;;2016-10-03T10:11:54+0000;1475489514;2016-10-03 12:11:54;2;0;3;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;2;1;0;0;0;0;0

It was supposed to be  Tender fillet of beef with roasted mushroom and onion duxelle wrapped in golden puff pastry.   What we actually got was lumps of fatty  sinewy mush of meat not actually a fillet but in 3/4 different pieces  with a bland tasteless mushroom and onion duxelle and soggy pastry despite following all of your instructions as per the pack.  My partner got a lump of sinewy fat so bad he had to stop eating and throw up.   I wish I had bought and made it myself as we now have 2 full meals wasted because it s practically inedible.   What was supposed to be a nice romantic relaxed meal for 2 while my son is with his grandma has turned into a wasted night and 2 very unhappy people.  Will certainly never buy anything  Finest  again.;;;;;2016-10-02T17:35:56+0000;1475429756;2016-10-02 19:35:56;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I today went to the local Trent Vale branch of Tesco in 287 Newcastle Road  Stoke-on-Trent  ST4 6PL   armed with 6 unique Covent garden internet printable vouchers in black and white. I purchased a number of items along with 6 Covent garden soups  I had also got 6 vouchers from the company which was  new Covent garden  soups Co.  Paying through self scan I was allowed to insert 2 vouchers without any problem  scanning the 3rd voucher an alert message appear for a supervisor intervention pops up. Fine I thought  so along comes the self scan body and checks everything.  This is where the fun starts  she quizzed me over the vouchers  she asked a manager about them who duly tooted along and started to accuse me of fraud not directly i may add  she said the vouchers were photocopies and she wanted originals and the originals had a silver strip down them  I explained that these were  internet printable  vouchers and they do not have a silver strip on them for the obvious reasons  however the  duty manager for the day was adamant that they were not original despite me telling her till I was blue in the face. Even going as far as explaining how they are generated.  The duty manager informed that the companies should be  posting genuine   vouchers   through the mail i m sorry but who is she to tell companies how they should be issuing promotional money off vouchers and coupon?  I requested the 6 vouchers they had in their hand back as I stated that I had used the same type previously on another visit a few days prior  the security   self scan operator and also the Duty Manager refused to give them back.  I challenged them on this stating that they were my property and had indeed been duly printed honestly and with good intent and that I wished to have them back so I could go to Sainsbury;s to redeem them.  I was refused by all three members of staff and did not get the vouchers returned  by this time people were standing around and watching  I felt intimated  belittled and made to feel as though I was committing fraud  I duly left after emptying my bags for life of the shopping I had purchased.  On contacting the duty manager for the store in general he stated tjhat it was due to the multiple names on the vouchers  I would like to add that as long there is one unique voucher to one unique invidual  then this should not create a problem. How many customers purchase shopping for disabled partners  friends  neighbours   relatives etc etc.";;;;;2016-10-02T15:41:39+0000;1475422899;2016-10-02 17:41:39;1;15;1;0;16;15;4;11;5;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I bought a phone from you less than 28 days ago. The phone has been awful: freezing  buttons jamming and yesterday the power button fell off. I took it back in and was refused a swap or return as the assistant said it was in an unacceptable condition - when asked what that condition was he said the power button being off (aka the issue I was bringing it in about) and a tiny scuff on the shell from removing the case I d had it in  - I now have to send it off to be  investigated  due to the assistant exaggerating its condition down the phone to the person he called up about it  (I can provide photos if needed of phone condition ) - I use my phone for work so not having a phone for a week plus is going to be a huge issue for me.  The assistants attitude was awful  he at one point face planted onto his computer screen in some amateur-dramatic response to me spelling my name (the only reason that I can think of for such a ridiculous response is some sort of transphobic reaction to a trans masculine person having a name he felt should be a woman s name). His whole attitude felt like it was designed to make me feel like I was being unreasonable or a trial on his patience just for existing and being in the shop asking for a replacement of a phone that was/is not up to standard with several faults it shouldn t have developed within the 26 days I ve owned it. It also felt like he was looking for excuses not to help me (searching the phone for any mark on it that he could use to refuse a refund  at one point claiming damage on the screen which turned out to be a fleck of dirt).;;;;;2016-10-02T14:52:10+0000;1475419930;2016-10-02 16:52:10;0;9;0;0;9;9;5;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Friday 30th September. My shopping was delivered with 12 items missing. I contacted your call centre and spoke to Lauren.(5pm) Lauren spent ages trying to get through to the store and told me that I would be getting a call back. Lauren was very helpful and refunded my delivery charge and also mailed me a fifteen pound e voucher by way of an apology. 2 hours later I d had no call so I called again. I was told that the person that should have called me back was named Levinson. He was on his break and would be calling me back at 8.20pm. 8.50pm stll no call so I called your call centre again. Spoke to Mark who left another message for Levinson to call me back and said it would be just after 9pm. Levinson finally returned from his mammoth break and called me at 9.25pm. No apologies instead denial that he had been given any messages to call me and said that he had been waiting for my delivery van to return to see if my missing items were there. I asked him how he knew I had missing items if he had not had any messages. He chose not to answer and asked me to tell him what my missing items were. I did. He assured me that they would be delivered the next day (1.10.16) between 11am and 12pm. (He had a bad attitude and was quite abrupt). Mark did call me back to check that Levinson had finished eating his Kit Kat and had called me. Saturday (1.10.16) 12.15pm.....Don t you just know....the missing items have not arrived. I call the call centre again. I spoke to Claire. She tried calling the store 3 times but there was no answer. (Levinson was probably on another break). To save me hanging on (again) Claire said she would call me back which she did to inform me that I wouldn t be getting my delivery today.Claire wanted to know what the missing items were so I told her and she said they would be delivered on Sunday (2.10.16) between 1pm and 2 pm.Claire told me that a manager from the store would be contacting me.(I believe the store is Greenford/Perivale) I got an email straight away from Claire showing that my delivery was scheduled for today with the missing items. I also got an email showing that the 12 items had been refunded and that I would get that refund in 3-5 days. Sunday (2.10.16) 1.15pm my order arrives. It s all there (not in carrier bags which I had previously paid for). On my receipt I noticed that not only had I been charged the delivery charge again I had also been charged because my order was under forty pounds. Are you having a laugh? The money for the missing items had been taken from my account this morning although the refund will take 3-5 days. So again I call your call centre dreading having to listen to the music that makes my ears bleed while life passes me by. I get through. I explain the whole sorry saga all over again. The man says he will refund my delivery charge and the minimum order charge. He then asks if I want anything else...yes I want to speak to a manager at the store because no one has called me back and I want to check that Levinson isn t being overworked and getting plenty of breaks..Man on phone puts me on hold. Another 10 minutes passes me by. No one is answering the phone at the store. Man on phone promises that someone will call me today or maybe tomorrow. Forgive me if I have no faith that I will get a call back.  So my questions are;Why did Levinson deny that he had any messages to call me? Why did it take him so long to call me back? Why was I promised my delivery on Saturday morning by Levinson and it never arrived? Why has no manager called me back? Why am I currently out of pocket because of Tesco s mistakes? And how long are your breaks at Tesco for your employees?  I get my shopping delivered by you every week and spend quite a bit of money. Apart from the man I spoke to today at your call centre all the other people have been helpful.(Obviously Levinson is not included in that either). Can someone please get in contact with me so that I can get some satisfactory answers? Many thanks.";;;;;2016-10-02T13:09:08+0000;1475413748;2016-10-02 15:09:08;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Tonight just proved nope you don t. When a young man walks in and asks for a box of paracetamol and a lucky dip for the national lottery please. He s sold the paracetamol but refused the lottery ticket as he doesn t look 16.  Amazing so you can cause irreparable damage to your liver but you can have the chance of winning the jackpot! BTW he is 16 and also my son. The response when I confronted him why he had sold him paracetamol when he thought he was under 16?

I have never received such poor customer service in a Tesco until I moved to Stalham. Several times I have been in the store and asked a member of staff where a certain item might be  each time I was told they were out of stock and each time I have been about to leave the store when I see the item I was looking for had been placed by the door for promotional purposes  I assume. This is just laziness from the staff. However  the incident I am complaining about is unrelated other than by location.  I had just arrived and parked my car  I was walking towards the store when I heard a lady shouting in frustration. I could see a woman struggling to open the boot of her car to place a Zimmer frame in there. The person behind her had parked over their space and into hers. Now there were two trolley attendants only a few feet away from her and they ignored her completely. I could hear her from halfway across the carpark and seeing that no one was helping  I walked over and helped her to get the frame in her car. I went into the store and spoke to someone and informed them what happened. I do not feel satisfied with the response of  I will tell them  referring to the attendants.  As a customer  I expect good service whether I am in the car park  at the petrol station or on the store. It is unacceptable that your staff do not provide this service. As a staff member  customer service should be a top priority but on top of that  you are a human being and surely it should be nature to help someone who clearly needs it? I understand you can t change someone s natural instinct but it should be a heavy part of the training to be BOTHERED about the customers around you.   This store has tarred my opinion of Tesco which used to be very high. If there was another supermarket close by to my house  I would change without a second thought. I m sure the poor lady that was struggling today  would want to as well.;;;;;2016-10-01T14:02:20+0000;1475330540;2016-10-01 16:02:20;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Unfortunately today for the first time ever  I made an error with the delivery time  I thought it was 1-2pm but it was 12-1!. I got home 12.08  with a voicemail saying  in an annoyed voice  that no one was in! Completely my fault  so I rang the driver and apologised saying how sorry I was. He was a bit stroppy   I m on my back to Inverurie! . So I nicely asked if I would be able to collect it  and he said he would leave it at click and collect. Fine I thought  my fault  but the more I think about it  the more I think his attitude could have been a bit better. It was an honest mistake. I have previously gotten in my car to drive to a layby to collect my delivery because the van broke down  I did this happily  it was not a problem. I got no refund of delivery but I wasn t bothered as the delivery drivers are always so nice.

I ordered ¬£60 worth of groceries to be delivered between 9pm and 10pm on Wednesday evening  as I was having people round for dinner the next day.  At 10.30pm there was no sign of my delivery  nor had anyone contacted me to say that the delivery driver was running late.  I contacted the customer services number and spoke to someone who told me that the delivery driver had returned to the store with my order as he was running late and could not deliver my order after 10pm because my order contained alcohol (one bottle of wine).  I think it was completely unfair that because the delivery driver was running late  I did not receive my order at all.  I was not contacted at all by someone to explain this  until AFTER I had phoned customer services  nor was I given the option of having my order delivered without the alcohol  and by the time I had spoke to someone in customer services about my order they said it was then too late for them to re-deliver the order that night.  This then put me in a predicament as I was having people round for dinner the following night and had to make alternative plans.  The gentleman at customer services arranged to have my order delivered the following day between 5-6pm  the order came WITHOUT bags (which I had previously asked for) which then meant that I had to dump ¬£60 worth of shopping in my hall way and to top it all off I have now checked my bank and it seems I have been charged twice by Tesco for my entire order.  The gentleman that I spoke to previously in Customer Services sent me through a voucher by email to the value of ¬£10 but I m afraid after all this hassle that does not even come close to making up for all the inconvenience it has caused.  I would be grateful if you could resolve this situation as soon as possible as I really am completely dissatisfied with the service I have received and would consider using other supermarkets in the future if this is not resolved quickly.  Thanks.;;;;;2016-10-01T10:47:49+0000;1475318869;2016-10-01 12:47:49;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

After spending 15 mins in the store we tracked down someone to talk to about buying a ps4 we were passed on to a manager who told my other half that they have the stock but it  wasn t for that offer . Confused we walked back to where the PlayStation stock was and picked up a ps4 ticket which had the offer on it   saying  take this ticket to electrical / click and collect to buy    A staff member named Sam was helpful and went out the back to get us a 500gb one telling us what a great offer it was and saying he has brought one himself a few hours before. He brought out an old ps4 500 gb   I then asked if they had any of the 1TB in stock as it was such a great offer we thought we would pay the extra and upgrade.  He went back and bought us out an ps4 1Tb and walked us down stairs to the till to pay as the tills were all shut upstairs.  As we were waiting to pay the night shift manager Damo walked up to us and took the ps4 out of Sams hands. His first words to us were  you were told this is an online only deal . He then repeated to Sam that the offer was online only and that we could only order online and collect in store. We then tried to do this but it said it was out of stock   even though the stock was physically there in front of us!!!  We then asked if we could have the 500Gb to which we were told they didn t have any....even though 5 mins ago Sam had brought one out to us!!  I then went onto the Tesco website to show that it does say in selected stores not just online only to be told again by Damo that it is an.online deal only by hot UK deals. Even though staff had told us they had brought one in store   and the tickets were out for the offer. We left empty handed and confused by Tescos Yate clear mistake. I don t understand why we were talked to like we were worthless and told time and time again that we were wrong  and then lied to about stock that we could see!!!!

The cucumber survived and it came in my bottom but everyone was (were) thoroughly good chaps  thanks again   Richard.;;;;;2016-10-01T00:25:51+0000;1475281551;2016-10-01 02:25:51;2;7;2;0;9;7;2;5;10;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0
