Now  I feel that the clue is in the name and that this product should indeed  pop.  My 5 year old Son  hanging eagerly from the string of the first one  pulled....... and the string came off in his hand. The only  pop  evident was the sound of his little  hopeful heart breaking. We tried another 4 times and the same thing happened. At ¬£3.50 I was reluctant to purchase them anyway  being that they would simply be money  literally  burnt. But knowing that my children find them an integral part of New Year s Eve  I purchased them.   Tesco  I now fear that our midnight celebrations will be  damp  or at least premature as we will have to manually burst the party poppers and unravel the cheap paper insides ourselves.   I ve endured many a disappointing bang in my lifetime but now you re messing with my kids and I have to draw the line at that.   We will start prepping for midnight at 11:45 due to the terrible quality of your party poppers. I hope you can live with yourselves.

I was advised to buy a replacement coat or bring the original receipt in  for my coat. I went away feeling annoyed and stressed as I had so much other stuff to do for Xmas.

The cost came to ¬£89.79. She had 2 full cards of saving stamps - so ¬£100 with which to pay. The young lad didn t know how to do it (? seasonal staff)  so asked for help from the girl behind. She explained how to do it but then said that if we used both cards we wouldn t get any change!  Due to a growing queue behind us we didn t feel that we could argue  so just handed one card over  along with ¬£34.50 of vouchers (which didn t need to be spent until November 2017) and then paid the difference (¬£4.71) in cash. I suggested going to customer service to check that the information about not getting change from unused stamps was correct but there was also a queue there. On 30/12/16  my mum went to the Widnes Extra store (her local store) and handed over the other card with ¬£50 of stamps on and was given change with no problem.  We are both annoyed that we had to use ¬£34.50 of vouchers and cash that we didn t need to use.

I dropped my basket and ran around the aisles I‚Äôd been to see if I had mislaid it etc. It wasn‚Äôt there. I started to really panic and get quite upset as the next bag had ¬£70 worth of baby outfits inside. I‚Äôd only bought them 20 minutes previous. I ran to the customer services desk  where they told me no (and without any obvious empathy either) I asked the security men who were standing by the door  at the CCTV cameras  if anyone had handed to them. They said no. I said would there be any way they could quickly check past 5 minutes of cctv incase the bag and potential thief were still in the store. They told me no and that I would have to come back tomorrow?! (Helpful). I  again  ran around all the aisles. At this point  I was actually crying with panic because I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford to buy these presents again. I asked a few employees again if anything had been handed in. They all said no... One actually said ‚Äònaw hen  it‚Äôs probably been lifted!‚Äô‚Ä¶ Not very helpful and frankly quite upsetting.      I stood at the door. Revisited the customer service desk and the various other desks (opticians etc.) a couple more times before I eventually gave up and left to go home. On the way home  I remembered an area I hadn‚Äôt revisited. I tried calling customer services to see if there would be any way they could check the specific area for me  as I don‚Äôt live near this particular Tesco. I got through to a call centre. They told me to drive back if I wanted to check it. (Wish I‚Äôd have thought of that myself Mrs Brains!?!)  From that point on  I got the local customer services number and proceeded to call the desk 13 times in total over a 6 hour period. They either never answered or hung up when they heard my voice. I spoke to one lady from these 13 attempts who seemed to be the only helpful employee in the whole store. She did check the area for me- unfortunately the bag wasn‚Äôt there either.     I returned to the store the following day to query the CCTV. The gentleman phoned his colleague to come down to the main entrance where my partner & I were waiting. I told him the exact time I entered the store  what I was wearing  what bags I was holding and told him the first place I headed for. He left and told me to come back in 15 minutes once he‚Äôd looked at the playback. When he returned  the gentleman said these exact words ‚ÄòYes I can see you on the camera. You came in with the bag and left without it‚Äô‚Ä¶..    He‚Äôd spent 15/20 apparently looking at CCTV... to tell me that? Useless information that I quite obviously KNEW. He then proceeded to lie to me... ‚ÄòWhen you came in  you veered over to the right and I didn‚Äôt catch where you went after that‚Äô... I replied ‚ÄòNo  I didn‚Äôt go over to the right at all? I went straight ahead. I went straight for the wrapping paper?‚Äô He replied ‚ÄòNo cos I seen you and your boyfriend go that way?‚Äô‚Ä¶    My boyfriend hadn‚Äôt been with me.       I am a retail manager. I regularly watch CCTV. I asked him had he not followed my route? Had it been the other way around... I would have followed a customer in segments to see at what point the bag wasn‚Äôt on their person anymore... Not only could I narrow it down and save myself time... but I also then be able to inform the customer of where & when exactly the bag was taken. I told him this. I wrote down my full route of the store and asked him to look at it for me. He said it would take him couple of hours... I reluctantly agreed that he could just call me instead. He said he‚Äôd phone me that night once he could confirm what the fate of the bag was. After this  I began to wonder how he‚Äôd seen me leave without my shopping bag if he hadn‚Äôt followed my route? Probably another lie...     That was the 19th December. It‚Äôs now the 31st. I‚Äôve never received that call back.   As a retail manager  I am genuinely appalled at this level of customer service. To show no empathy to a young girl who is visibly upset is bad enough. To ignore calls  hang up on customers  lie to their face and never give them the call back promised to them is horrific.   To make matters worse  I‚Äôve since been informed by an employee of the next store that I also revisited  that Tesco Silverburn are hopeless at helping people in circumstances like this. That is awful. I will never step foot in your store again. I know Tesco won‚Äôt care that 1 person  a number like me won‚Äôt shop there again... but hopefully people reading this never have to rely on the staff of the Tesco Silverburn store ever again. They are useless and quite clearly have no regard for their customers and their customers‚Äô possessions.";;;;;2016-12-31T10:44:45+0000;1483181085;2016-12-31 11:44:45;6;5;11;8;24;5;3;2;3;0;5;0;0;0;0;5;0

I m really disgusted at your attempt to mill me and my children. Whilst travelling on your travellator from the top floor back to the first floor  I received a mains electrical shock to my left ring finger. The shock was large enough to cause my forearm muscles to contract. I am an electronics engineer and I am well aware of the difference between static discharge and a mains electrical discharge. I immediately held my children away from the sides. And contacted a member of staff to ensure they shut off the power supply immediately. This didnt happen. They tried to fob me off with a static story until eventually I insisted the store manager attend. When she did I told her in the interest of public safety it needed to be turned off until an electrical safety check could be carried out. Unbelievably she said she would need to check with the area manager!!!!!!!   What if this had been a child? What if the next time it stops someone s heart? This is an  appalling health and safety attitude!!!!!  Please please get the travellator shut off and get it checked!!!!!!;;;;;2016-12-31T09:35:18+0000;1483176918;2016-12-31 10:35:18;1;11;5;4;20;10;6;4;4;0;1;0;2;0;0;2;0

He returned a Lego yesterday as he had received it twice for Christmas. He was told it would be easy to exchange if we found something for the same value or more. He excitedly (after 25mins consideration) selected three boxes of Lego for the similar value. We went to the customer services desk to exchange and was told one item was not on the system. The sales assistant then said they would not be able to sell him the Lego. I asked if they could find the price or a manger to help  to which we were told to select another item. I am unsure why there would be products on your shelf which you cannot sell. My son was very disappointed he could not have the Lego he so wanted. I am very disappointed at the level of assistance offered by the staff. I look forward to your response.;;;;;2016-12-30T20:11:07+0000;1483128667;2016-12-30 21:11:07;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

On numeorus occasions they have snapped at customers for asking on issues why actual prices are different than display prices. I and my mother are regular customers  here for more than 6 years and previously we are customers at tesco kajang. Further necessities like sugar or salt or vegetables if out stocks are not stocked promptly. The cashiers or staffs loosely will address most female customers as aunty.They refer my mother who is in her mid 60s as aunty and I in mid 30s as aunty.What is the actual meaning of aunty? Does cashiers and staffs at UK Tesco refer to their female customers as aunty? Why in the earth they make us as their relatives? And today when I asked a temporary cashier at counter 17 around 7.30 pm  why she addressed me as aunty  she replied thats what they were trained to call customers like that. She didn t even apologise for wrong use of language.When I correct her that she is in customer service line and she should address customers promptly like sir  madam or ms (in malay cik or encik).Mind you I was not shouting or scolding at her.However she snapped and started to throw the items I have purchased  after  she finished scanning prices and when I asked her to stop doing that she didnt bother to apologise or stop. She continued to throw my credit card and receipt. I immediately I told I will lodge a complaint against her  she just said thank you very much. I can t bother to complaint there as previously other rude incident took place in front of the line leader or supervisor but he didnt bother.Disappointed with bad customer service.;;;;;2016-12-30T14:26:11+0000;1483107971;2016-12-30 15:26:11;0;5;0;0;5;5;1;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My first delivery had the following missing item...shower gel! I have said that I will take substitutes but it said no substitute available!!! Am I dealing with a corner shop here? I really can t imagine no shower gel on your shelves. I didn t bother to complain at the time just thought a minor fault. Let s go on to the second delivery  on taking out the fridge bag I could see it wasn t mine! The young deli very man went to phone his team leader  returning to me he said I had two options  either money credited or goods redelivered the next day  which I think was the Saturday. This was the option I chose  he was unable to give me a time slot  but after staying in all day there was no delivery. I then phoned the customer service in Wales  they tried to get in touch with my Southampton but for whatever reason were unable to have a conversation with them. At this stage I elected to take a refund for the goods. Later in the week I did receive a telephone call from yourselves apologising and offering me a ¬£10 voucher off me next delivery  which I accepted. She did say that after asking team leaders they said that they had not had a call from the delivery man!  My next couple of deliveries were okay.....now we come to my delivery of yesterday. I was away for Christmas so this order was covering a meal for company yesterday but what should be missing...my pork leg joint!!!! and a picking fault  the security tag on a bottle of whisky. After about 5 minutes of trying to remove tag by the delivery man we had to admit defeat  he did say I could send it back but seeing how I needed it for my guest that was not an option. I phoned customer service again who contacted Southampton who duly phoned me. This phone call was not helpful and I was given the option to go into store and pick a joint  of which on consulting your sight were plentiful! including the one that I had chosen.

Having ordered a wooden kitchen for our niece for Christmas  it arrived in good time and was set aside for the big day. Upon opening the gift  it was found that one of the plastic panels had a severe crack in it  rendering the item dangerous and unusable. Having travelled over 2hrs to drop the gift off in the first place  we explained to your call centre staff member that we were unable to exchange the item in store and that they were welcome to collect. Having agreed to send a replacement out to our local store  we asked if there was anything else that could be done  as in addition to having a very upset little girl on Christmas morning  who had waited months for her desired present  we would now have to take another trip  over 2hrs in order to deliver it to her and the magic of the present being from Santa had been lost. This has not only inconvenience us  in that we both work full time and the delivery of this gift to our niece would now be very much delayed  but it is also  obviously  very difficult to explain to a very young child that her gift will not be with her for another lengthy period. Having explained this to your staff member  he merely laughed at my partner over the phone  which is not only poor customer service  but extremely rude behaviour and as a result we will definitely be thinking long and hard before we shop with you again. Having worked for you ourselves  in management positions previous to our current employment  we were unaware that your customer service training had altered so greatly  or been omitted altogether!;;;;;2016-12-30T09:07:05+0000;1483088825;2016-12-30 10:07:05;14;2;14;3;19;2;2;0;5;0;14;0;0;0;0;0;0

I felt so belittled & as if i was a  bad parent for having my son out late. It isn t something I make a habit of & I m sure im not the first parent to have to take their child out late for medicine. Unfortunately I don t have anyone else at home or I wouldn t have had to take him with me. Maybe you need to be better educating your staff instead of letting them make your paying customers feel so small! To most it s not a big deal but I genuinely felt like I had done something wrong & immediately went to pay and leave!!  So upset!;;;;;2016-12-30T01:30:23+0000;1483061423;2016-12-30 02:30:23;0;1;6;0;7;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;2;0;0;4;0

To crown it all  the assistant  somewhat exasperated  took the batteries from me AND PROMPTLY THREW THEM IN THE BIN UNDER THE DESK!!!! How irresponsible.  I did ask for them back so I could dispose of them properly. Is Tesco above the law?;;;;;2016-12-29T19:59:09+0000;1483041549;2016-12-29 20:59:09;0;4;0;0;4;4;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

A blonde lady member of staff helped me trying to find some. She checked all the shelves and was so helpful. In the end she suggested customer service to check stock in case some somewhere. As I walked away I heard her shout and came running up to me with a box of bay leaves. We had a big hug and everyone around us smiled. It was like  Love Actually ! I felt Christmas in that moment. Then to get to the check out and realise I forgot the cheese and crackers so the lovely lady at the checkout says  don t worry-you get what you need . I came back to find she had emptied my trolley for me and my put all my shopping on conveyor belt. What an amazing staff. Thankyou. Wish I had got their names.

Today I visited my local branch  Swan Centre) and used scan and shop. Myself and my 3 year old enjoy doing this  and she had a very special treat she was allowed to buy ¬£15 of toys. A massive treat!  So we found a LOVELY Pink cat with sparkly eyes  it didn t scan  and said that it was not on the stock file and see the staff at the till. My daughter  needless to say  was EXTREMELY excited  a pink cat that even had glittery eyes  what more could a 3 year old want?  We got to the till  scanned and it asked if something wouldn t scan  so hit yes. The slightly helpful man  sauntered over  took the teddy that my daughter was excited about  couple of minutes later  sorry madam you can t buy this  it s not on file  it s a Health and Safety issue .... Sorry what? A health and safety issue  are you taking the mick??? A pink cat teddy  what s it gonna do? Throat slam me as I put it in the car? So I calmly ask  sooooo  the toys faulty  and on your shelves? ‚Äú his baffled response   no its just a health and safety issue .  My now upset 3 year old  had to watch the pink cat  be taken  and put in the basket of no return. So now I have a distraught child  no flipping pink cat with glittery eyes  and tears as she sat in the car with nothing to hug.  Please don t stock your shelves with toys that can not be sold  and definitely don t teach your staff that just because something isn t on stock file  that they should tell customers it s a Health and safety issue. My daughter  crying in the back of the car however is a health and safety issue.  Thanks Tesco for spoiling our special treat.;;;;;2016-12-29T18:52:13+0000;1483037533;2016-12-29 19:52:13;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Unfortunately when she opened it it would not turn on  we then charged it for 2hrs and still nothing appeared on the screen to say it was charging or even to just turn on. The whole of Christmas day was ruined for her as she didnt get much else to play with and she was very upset thinking how  Santa  would be able to fix it and he might not be able to do anything. I reassured her I would go and buy her a new ipod and she even offered to give me her ¬£35 she recieved from others for Christmas to help with the cost.   I sent an email to the CEO straight away but still havent got a reply!   Now I decide to take it back to Tesco Peterborough and ask for an exchange as it was faulty  but the lady who served me (Jane) asked for my card  I found that strange as it was just an exchange and as I went to put my card in the machine I said to her I wanted an exchange but she just said  the money will go back onto your account within 3-5working days  I then said that I never wanted a refund and I asked for an exchange  she got funny with me and said I never said that. I was more cross that I only had ¬£250 in my account and that was going on bills and that I promised my daughter I would get a new ipod and now because of this womans mistake I would either have to wait a few days to recieve the money back to purchase a new 1 and let my daughter down once again  or buy her a new 1 and me struggle for a few days.   This is probably going to be my daughters last year of believing in Santa and her day was ruined because of the faulty product I purchased from Tesco.   All they could offer me was ¬£20 fuel costs for the inconvenience! In my opinion it was not good enough for the mistake a collegue had made and also had an attitude who offered no help and also still having no reply from the CEO regarding my email of complaint!   I will be emailing the CEO again.  Elisa Conte;;;;;2016-12-29T13:26:46+0000;1483018006;2016-12-29 14:26:46;0;5;2;0;7;5;2;3;3;0;0;0;0;1;1;0;0

We ve just been shopping at your Park Farm store in Ashford  Kent.  Myself  my wife along with our 2 year old and 11 week old had to do a big shop and it ended up being a bigger shop than planned!  After 2 hours and 2 full trollies  by the time we get to the check out - patience was wearing thin.  Our little girl was irritable  our baby was screaming - they were fed up  we were fed up (the people behind us in the queue were fed up!)   2 of your wonderful staff came to the rescue!    We didn t catch their names  but a gentleman and a lady  both with headsets on  so I assume your Check out Managers / Supervisors.  They gave our little girl a banana to keep her occupied  unloaded our trolley onto the belt so my wife could take the baby out and offered to help with the packing.    We thanked them for their kind help - but their service was above and beyond - so I d be very grateful if our appreciation could be reiterated to them and their managers made aware of their excellent service.    Well done Tesco!;;;;;2016-12-29T12:15:32+0000;1483013732;2016-12-29 13:15:32;19;3;19;0;22;3;1;2;3;0;19;0;0;0;0;0;0

As I was approaching the parent and child parking (I have a 1 yr old who was with me) a car reversed into the place next to me. The driver was on his own  he took up 2 spaces and proceeded to stare at me the whole time I walked towards the door. I reported that he was in a parent and child space to customer service and even pointed him out  he verbally abused me in the store and the lady I reported it to asked him if he was parked in a P&C space  he replied yes but I only came in for a magazine  to which she replied  oh  ok then .....  The car park wasn t full  and in fact there was a vacant parking space right outside the door.   How is it acceptable for this to happen? Maybe I should park in the disabled parking and do the same? Or perhaps I should park across 2 normal spaces so I have room to get my child out of the car?;;;;;2016-12-29T11:48:29+0000;1483012109;2016-12-29 12:48:29;0;13;1;0;14;13;6;7;9;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

The Hatchimal has now become a thorn in my side. After searching for one for my great granddaughter  who is 8 years old  for a surprise christmas present I thought all my troubles were over when I was visiting my stepdaughter in Watford and we shopped in your Extra store there. Eureka !! Ifound a pink Hatchimal sitting there   I bought it   thought problems solved. Christmas day arrives and my great granddaughter arrives at my home with Mum and Dad for dinner. She opens all her gifts first and then i gave her the Hatchimal which she didn t know she might be getting. The excitement on her face  she couldn t believe that she had one. She does have problems in getting over excited so she was getting frustrated getting it out of the packaging so I took it out and she proceeded to follow the instructions as she saw them to get this thing to Hatch. after twenty minutes of her getting more and more frustrated and no sign of anything happening with this Hatchimal   I started to investigate it . i followed the instructions to the letter and it did absolutely nothing ?? There was no obvious signs of how to check batteries or even where they fitted in etc. During the initial handling the shell did start to feel soft and pliable in parts and pieces of the shell came off for us to discover this tiny little wide eyed creature sitting inside doing absolutely nothing ??? Now for  cutting the long story short  what has made it worse was that one of her cousins also received one and we have since seen what they are supposed to do so we are now certain that we have a DUD. I went on line to a website they said to check in the instructions and then found a free phone number to ring to troubleshoot. This kept me on the line with a recorded voice asking me to wait and some one would attend to me . Needless to say after patiently waiting for two hours( good job it was free) I got tired and hung up. I then went on line to tesco site   which i now realise is the Tesco Direct  and found the number to contact some one with regards to this. i have spoken them today and after going through all the ritual of name number etc. and asking me to hold  a very polite young man then informs me that they have no record of my order on my account ?? I again explained that i bought it in the store and he then said oh Im sorry we can t help you   this is Tesco Direct so we have no record of your buying this item. he said i would have to return it to the store. As I bought it in Watford and I live a couple of hundred miles away I don t think this was very helpful. I would like some one to come back to me to advise what to do now with a totally defunct Hatchimal   a lot of money out of pocket and most important of all a most upset  disappointed great granddaughter  and no type of recompense can help sort this out. She is just so upset. I look forward to hearing from some one by return to try and resolve this for her.

I went there yesterday to exchange a gift my neephew had for Christmas. I was told to take a non electrical toy to the electrical desk  when asked why as it s not electrical the staff member said she would serve me. I explained I didn t have a receipt and she just smiled at me. I chose a few items went back to the desk and she told me I had to find items to the same value and couldn t put the difference on a gift card. So off I went and did some food shopping. I picked up some wrapping paper and a member of staff told me they were still in the 3 for 2 offer even though they were reduced. I took all my bits to the desk to get served for the 3rd time and asked her to check if the paper was in the offer to which she smiled at me in-between chatting to her mates at the desk. I was told yes (in reply to my question about the paper and it came up on the till) Brilliant I thought  managed to pay the difference for my good in between her chatting to her mates and hardly looking at us let alone speak to us. She was so engrossed in her conversation  she didn t ask if I had a Clubcard. So after serving me I asked her to add the point to which she huffed. I left the store biting my tongue. Got home and checked my receipt and the wrapping paper didn t come up as 3 for 2. Im more annoyed with the fact that she had no time for us as customers and was more interested in talking to her colleague mates and was dismissive of us more than the fact she blatantly had no idea i had asked about the paper and just smiled at me.;;;;;2016-12-28T08:16:16+0000;1482912976;2016-12-28 09:16:16;0;7;1;0;8;7;5;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

However  Tesco bank were not so helpful. We pay money into Tesco clubcard plus account every month throughout the year to pay for our Christmas shopping. When we came to pay this year however we were told to use alternative payment even though we knew there was enough money in the account. Customer service phoned the bank who couldnt help as account wasnt set up for phone banking. This account was set up in 1997 when it wasnt the norm for telephone banking and we have used the card every year without a problem. So that was the end of that  they couldnt do anything about the fact we had no way of paying for our Christmas food.

Every time he plays with it the track seems to fall apart as the wooden supports just slip out causing the track to fall down. As this is designed for small children it doesn t seem to make sense for it all to just balance causing it to constantly collapse with the slightest amount of pressure or smallest bump to the table which is to be expected from small children. Sadly this has caused many tears and a lot of upset over the last two days. I would defiantly not recommend this product to anyone and feel very disappointed that we spent the money on it for our son. We sadly also bought another of your train sets to go with it (which we haven t yet been brave enough to open) costing us almost ¬£100 along with all the extras bought for him by friends and family. All in all a real waste of ours and other people s money and one very upset little bot for Christmas !!!!

Well this one could not be bothered to come out from behind his hideyhole and left the assistant to do all the questioning.  She was very pleasant and willing but as there was no one else there I would have appreciated speaking directly to him instead of her having to relay my symptoms and check with him what she thought would be ok.

Firstly this breaks trading laws as I was informed I was buying a new ps4 not a refurbished one.

(Ystrad Mynach) Majority of the money spent was on 3 turkey crowns. While carving the crowns to serve up christmas lunch i was rather disappointed to find not only big legs left on the crowns but a lot of other bone too  never had this before with crowns from Tesco.  Therefore  i don t think these crowns were good value for money  less meat and more bones! Normally a crown id all good meat and no waste!!!!!  Luckily enough i alway go over board and cater for more than i need so i have extra meat for the following days to feed the guests  so we all had enough for our christmas lunch.

Spoke to the manager of the store and no real apology nothing and nothing from the security guard. To say I am upset and disgusted is beyond words. I will not be shopping in store again and will be forwarding this to Guide Dogs as it is discrimination and illegal to one trying to refuse entry and 2 speaking to me in manner in which I was spoken.;;;;;2016-12-26T14:46:34+0000;1482763594;2016-12-26 15:46:34;0;5;1;0;6;5;2;3;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

I am writing to seek some information on your Brussel sprouts. We are now two hours post Xmas dinner but the wind hasn t arrived. This has led to the cancellation of the twelfth annual Stokes family farting competition.   We have our suspicions that these sprouts have been genetically modified to reduce the output of the happy gasses that normally abound post dinner and support the competition.   As the defending champion  My 86 year old gran  is inconsolable that she hasn t had the opportunity to defend her crown. She had promised wind to match that of storm Barbara  We feel that you should‚Äã mark the packaging with estimated happy gas output so as to allow customers to make better choices.  I m not saying you have ruined our Christmas festivities but it has put a huge dent in family morale. The turkey crown and pigs in blankets were most excellent so we congratulate you on this aspect of the meal.   It could be there is a delay in the action of the sprouts and I will feed back if this is the case but we are normally well underway by now.  I would be grateful if you could confirm if anything has changed with the genetic make up of this usually wonderful vegetable.  Lastly we would like to thank all the wonderful staff at your Hunstanton store who bent over backwards to be so friendly and helpful with our Christmas shop. We wouldn t want there good name sullied by the failure of the sprouts.  Best wishes  The Stokes ;;;;;2016-12-25T17:05:26+0000;1482685526;2016-12-25 18:05:26;90;34;181;62;277;31;27;4;72;0;90;5;0;85;0;0;0

Whilst waiting a member of your staff wearing blue jeans and a red top with blonde hair came up and tried to turn the self services machines on  another worker approached her and told her to keep them turned off as the store was closing in 5 minutes. She then stood there and and argued about management and how the woman would never answer when she needs to be called down to help them in the future. The poor colleague she was shouting at left her and walked away because she was causing a massive scene. She then decided to stop and tell all of her colleagues what had happened. She was completely unprofessional and was bad mouthing your management as well as her other colleague who was just clearly doing his job. It s people like her that brings shame upon companies. I honestly felt so sorry for the man who was just trying to do his job. This was about 6:55pm. I suggest you talk to whoever this person is because her language  tone of voice and professionalism were not at all in line with where they need to be.;;;;;2016-12-24T22:51:11+0000;1482619871;2016-12-24 23:51:11;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

The table cost ¬£75  he only has a couple of presents as that was expensive enough for me... instead of building it  thought maybe putting it back in box and wrapping it so we could put him off building it tomorrow and resolve the issue Boxing day with you.

I visited Tesco new ollerton store today with my disabled mother. As I could imagine we was greeted by a very busy store!  My mum uses the wheel chairs that Tesco have  but today both were in use. Whilst hovering around in hope of locating one I was greeted by a lovely Gentleman called Douglas who was giving out free magic reindeer food to the passing children and to which he handed me some too for my children who were patiently waiting at home which I thanked him for. He then went out of his way to help locate a chair for my mother whilst we waited in the cafe with a cuppa and when he located one he came straight to us. We then went in to do our shopping two trolleys became a handful! So at the checkout who appears? Douglas!! What a little Gem he helped to bag up our shopping in a bigger trolley and then took it to our car where he then packed it In Our boot! He then went onto offer to return the wheel chair and trolley too but not before wishing us a wonderful Christmas!  Douglas you re a credit to Tesco! One of the nicest staff I ve ever met and I mean that!  I m sorry I didn t get your surname but I recall you telling me all about you being semi retired.  Tesco this guy deserves a well deserved pat on the back!  Merry Christmas to you all xx;;;;;2016-12-24T18:36:56+0000;1482604616;2016-12-24 19:36:56;15;7;20;2;29;7;7;0;6;0;15;5;0;0;0;0;0

My other two local supermarkets (Asda Aldi) was offering the essentials for 19p each...carrots  parsnips  potatoes  broccoli and sewed. Tesco was twice the price and more with the swede at ¬£1 and potatoes even higher. When I mentioned this to your staff at the octocal way store swindon the reply was .... there is a Aldi 2mins away so go there !  With this reply I emptied my full basket of veg rite there on the bananas n replied back ok I will... please it these back for me.  Also I had purchased 2 bath tin sets ( that s so Betty ) on sale of a caged table in middle of the store  these were marked up on yellow A4 price card reduced to ¬£3.50. On checkout I was charged ¬£7.50 and reported the charge to your customer service desk who said the price is correct without even looking and offered me a full refund  I said I want the items but the ticket showed ¬£3.50 and want it looked at.  The ladie went off to look and said it was the wrong ticket and had taken it off the stand. She then offered to refund me the over charge amount but when I said about the double the difference policy she said no as doing it as a good will gesture ..... I asked again about the policy and told the question is getting big n she was alone . My option is refund the over payment or full refund pick one. Well I took the part refund obviously but if you have these policy s then the staff should honour  them .  That s my rant over. Enjoy your Christmas üéÑ;;;;;2016-12-24T18:36:56+0000;1482604616;2016-12-24 19:36:56;1;5;2;0;7;5;4;1;3;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0

He likes to ride his scooter to Tesco as we live locally. He always leaves his scooter in the correct place at the front with all the other scooters and buggies. After we finished our shop we were leaving when we realised we had forgotten my sons scooter so he ran back inside to get it. My son came back out in tears. He told me your security guard had called him a  stupid boy  because he had knocked someone elses scooter over. I went back inside to ask the security guard what had happened but immediately he was very aggressive verbally and started shouting at me. I asked for his name but he declined to give it to me so I took a picture of him that I can show you privately to identify. I then went to customer services and asked to speak with a manager. I told your manager what had happened and it really was evident my son was telling the truth because as I was telling the manager the security guard was telling other people about it and pointing at us. Your manager apologised to me and my son and let him chose out a box of chocolates as an apology which was very kind of you. Another of your workers at customer services told me that this was not the first time there had been problems with security guards but that there was little to be done because they are employed by a different company and not Tesco. As we were leaving the security guard was shouting at the manager who was trying to deal with the situation. I found this appalling but felt it better to leave it at that.  However I have now felt compelled to write a complaint on here because the security guard has since appear intimidating to us when we have gone back to Tesco Leytonstone on different occasion to do our weekly shop. Last week as myself and my son were walking into Tesco to do our weekly shop he pointed at us out to another security guard and was I assume telling his colleague god knows what about us. I ignored this. However today I popped in to Tesco Leytonstone with my son to pick up some last minute items. As we were walking down one of the isles the security guard walked up to us  stopped and starred at my son up and down. Again I ignored this and just pulled my son along by the hand.   This is not acceptable behaviour. I should be able to do my shopping in Tesco without feeling intimidated or worried. I live local and have shopped at Tesco Leytonstone since it opened. In fact I was present at Tesco Leytonstone when Dirty Den from Eastenders came to cut the ribbon to officially open the store! I spend a lot of money at Tesco Leytonstone as we dont have much of a high street and its literally around the corner from me but I will be forced to shop elsewhere should this sort of intimidation and unprofessional behaviour continue. I am being treated like what feels a potential thief and who knows what he has told other staff about me/us? If you are unable to do anything about this security guard then please could you provide me with the security firm he works for so I can make an official complaint to them about him.;;;;;2016-12-24T16:24:50+0000;1482596690;2016-12-24 17:24:50;0;0;3;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;2;0

I encouraged my daughter to be careful and tried to make conversation by asking what time she finished she abruptly said 7! My daughter continued to look through the clothes with the woman tutting if she accidentally dropped something! My daughter even commented after we left saying  why was that lady cross with me  #cheerupitschristmas!! #smilewouldntgoamiss;;;;;2016-12-24T09:15:02+0000;1482570902;2016-12-24 10:15:02;0;1;3;0;4;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;3;0

I signed up on the tesco website last week  and I ve placed a grocery order to be delivered next week. Is signing up online the same as signing up for a club card? Will I be sent a club card  or do I have to sign up to something different to get a club card? I m potentially suffering from baby brain or something  but I ve been looking on the website and I can t seem to establish what I ve signed up for and if they are the same thing! Hopefully someone can help me  thank you :);;;;;2016-12-24T08:38:40+0000;1482568720;2016-12-24 09:38:40;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My mum sent my family and i a ¬£100 tesco voucher to spend on extra christmas treats but sadly when our post arrived this morning it had been removed from the envelope.  Royal mail refused to even search the postmans bag and so we turned to tesco for some help. After trawling every shopping bag in the house my very upset mum managed to find a receipt that had the whole gift card number on it. Several calls to tesco later and they agreed to block the card from being used and even offered ¬£50 (sent to us via royal mail - no thanks!!) As a goodwill gesture instead of the ¬£100 voucher that had already been purchased. We requested a number of times that the full balance be transfered to a new card or even an online evoucher as we use tesco online weekly to do our ¬£200 food shop. This was absolutely  point blank refused. Why? We can prove the card was purchased  have receipts and credit card statements to back this up yet tesco  2 days before christmas wouldnt allow us the gift that had already been paid for for us.   We now have to rely on a post office claim form to POSSIBLY come up trumps and find our missing voucher but have been told it could take up to 12 weeks just to be processed. Assuming it hasnt already been pocketed by someone - likely!  #tesco  i am incredibly disappointed in your lack of cooperation today. The gift card was lost  we didnt want a refund  just the funds transfered so they could be spent in your store!

While going up and down the isles I came across 2 members of staff having a full in ear shot discusion and slagging match about customers. They were making comments about how many customers were at the store and how busy it was then to my disgust the comment came about how  metal  and  off our heads  we were for being there at this time of night!!!!   I feel now I need to explain WHY we were there at 10:30p.m with a 5 year. My daughter has a condition called hyperacousis.....Google it. It is where she has over sensitive hearing and being in a busy place  music and loads of people talking is scary  loud and over bearing. It is a documented disability and to have members of YOUR staff slagging YOUR customers off makes me sick. Totally disgusted at this and feel comments like that are what makes me scared people judge my daughter. I will not be back and am ashamed of the members of staff who made these comments. Maybe they should live one day in my daughters shoes and also be educated on hyperacousis and the affects these nasty comments have on my daughter  myself and customers. üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤;;;;;2016-12-23T23:28:58+0000;1482535738;2016-12-24 00:28:58;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

She just wanted some pyjamas to go with the Sindy doll. For some reason  the doll is available on line but the outfits arent?? I had friends and family search in their Tesco for the outfits  but with no luck.  So I thought I would contact you. It all looked extremely hopeful. You have me two stores locally that were due delivery of the outfit my daughter wanted  you ensured that one was going to be put by for a friend to collect for me. My friend went in as arranged and one hadn t been put by. She was told they were out of stock and were due delivery on a Monday evening so to go back in Tuesday morning. Still nothing. We were told they were due in but couldn t say when  so my friend has been in every day checking for me. I was told they were out of stock  then I was told that store was due some but couldn t tell me when.  In the end I had to make the decision to get an alternative product for my daughter as you clearly weren t going to produce any.

When you mark up Ben and Jerry s ice cream in your stores as being on offer:  Any 2 for ¬£6 400-500ml ... It implies and indeed means ANY that meet the criteria I.e. 400-500ml  (certainly within in the display/freezer compartment).  What I was not expecting when I challenged your in-store customer services on this  was to be told it only applied to the  normal  ice cream. E.g. Not Phish food as I had purchased. Incidentally  Ben and Jerry s Phish food is clearly offered at 2 for ¬£6 on your website!  This tells me one of two things... A. This is a deliberate act to mislead customers. Or B.

I shopped in the Nailsea branch this evening  as I have ever since it opened. To do my Xmas shop I took my 17 year old son as I required two trollies. Having already put  boxes of beer  cider and wine in my trolley myself I asked my son to get three individual bottles of cider. My son was approached in the soft drink isle later on and told that he would not be able to buy the alcohol unless he had identification. My son stated that he was with me and that he wasn t buying the alcohol. My son fetched me and I explained the situation. Astoundingly  I was informed that because he put the alcohol in the trolley it was considered by Tesco s that I was purchasing it on his behalf. Consequently   I was refused sale of the alcohol and it was taken from me. I was then informed I could not come in to the store and purchase alcohol for another 24 hours. I fully understand why Tesco s and other supermarkets have measures to prevent alcohol bring purchased on behalf of minors however this was an utterly ridiculous over reaction with a spectacular failure to apply any common sense.

Apparently a common fault with there hudle 2 hence why they have stopped making them (more hassle than what it s worth). After calling Tesco s technical support and them telling me to press a few buttons here and there the screen would light up but no android sign. The thing just won t charge nothing wrong with cable as I tried on my phone and that charges fine. They asked me if I had the receipt which luckily I found took a picture and emailed it over. I was told they would be in touch low and behold they rang today. To my disgust they said the tablet was worth ¬£0 and that it was out of manufactured warranty and if I want it repaired I would have to pay ¬£69..... no exchange  no money back  no offer of nothing. Well I will just make you aware TESCO that I have been in contact with trading standards about the matter and they have made me aware of you not following the Sales Of Goods Act 1979  Consumer Goods Act  Satisfactory Rights etc. I will take this further as I did not buy a throw away tablet. As for your customer service it is appalling very rude and unsympathetic. You could say I m a very unhappy customer and will be avoiding your store and products in future.;;;;;2016-12-23T19:45:57+0000;1482522357;2016-12-23 20:45:57;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;7;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My groceries were delivered on time  but with several Christmas dinner items missing. I immediately called customer services who contacted the driver to arrange re-delivery. The driver returned and stated that he had delivered my items to another customer and although he had been back there  he didn‚Äôt have my missing items. He offered me a crate of items to look through for my items ‚Äòor something similar‚Äô  there weren‚Äôt any. He advised he would contact the warehouse with a list of my missing items and have them sent out to me today. I contacted Customer services again (10am) to ensure that this had happened - it had not.   Customer services contacted the store and called me back stating the items would be redelivered today and that the store would call me with a time slot.  At 1:30pm I had not heard from the store so  again  contacted customer services to enquire about my missing groceries. I was put on hold while the store was contacted only to be told that the store ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt have the man power to redelivery my groceries today as they already had 120 redeliveries from yesterday‚Äô. The customer services manager advised that my items would then be refunded.  I asked to be transferred to a team leader who advised he would again contact the store or try to have the items put aside in a local express store. On calling back  he  again  said the store would not redeliver due to a lack of ‚Äòman power‚Äô and that no local store had all of the items that were missing - what a surprise two days before Christmas!   Clearly  Tesco  you have overstretched yourselves and are unable to fulfil the orders that you have taken. Online grocery shopping is supposed to be convenient and stress free - it has been neither today. After one redelivery  4 phone calls and 6 hours of waiting  I now have to shop for my missing goods.  Absolutely unacceptable.;;;;;2016-12-23T14:46:23+0000;1482504383;2016-12-23 15:46:23;0;8;8;2;18;8;4;4;2;0;0;0;1;0;0;7;0

However completely true to his word  Ian called back and tried to explain what may have happened  we spoke at length about different options and how we could resolve the problem satisfactorily  but at the end of it all the item I had ordered had gone back to it s original price but was in stock - did I want to order it again? I had no choice  really as it was a Christmas present for my son so I agreed to re-order the product which I collected the following day.  Ian went totally above and beyond his role to make sure I got the product I wanted and even went the extra mile to make sure I was completely satisfied and not out of pocket. Thank you Ian  I Hope you have a lovely Christmas!;;;;;2016-12-23T12:03:12+0000;1482494592;2016-12-23 13:03:12;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ordered a Christmas delivery for all my Christmas dinner items through Tesco online and before placing the order I called tesco to check EVERYTHING would be delivered as it was important nothing was left out with it being for Christmas. Despite being told I would be guaranteed everything with it being a Christmas slot I still had a load of food not turn up.   I hope all those people awaiting deliveries over the next few days are prepared to go the supermarket anyway as tesco have washed their hands of my complaint   can t find  my phone call where I was assured there would be no issue (despite me giving time / date etc) and told me that if the stock isn t in store on the day tough basically. So good luck everyone because if you have deliveries over the next few days I would put my money on it that there will be a lot of stock now unavailable and therefore you will be missing a fair few order items - but Tesco won t give a toss.;;;;;2016-12-23T10:55:05+0000;1482490505;2016-12-23 11:55:05;2;18;2;0;20;18;3;15;5;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

He was asked for id and being over the legal age to buy alcohol  he did have id. He was with his 14year old sister  who was then also asked for id. As she isn t over 18  she has no id. So the sale was refused.  He explained that he knows the think 25 policy and as his sister didn t touch the alcohol or even ask about it  there was no proof it was a proxy sale  so there was no need to refuse it (this statement is in fact correct  I have done my think 25 Tesco policy training!)  Team support was called and also agreed that he was correct but she was refusing the sale! He said that he would just come back once he had dropped his sister off. He was then told that any future sales would also be refused! So I m wondering 2 things.. 1.. when does Tesco decide that they can refuse any sales to a person of legal age without any real reason?? 2.. when does being a team support give you the qualifications to decide how I parent my child and that I allow her to drink gin???

Never experienced any supermarket shop like it. After using aldi for the main shop i visitted at approx 9:30 tonight for my top end goods. Almost every aisle had new stock littered on both sides making it hazardous and very difficult to pass another trolley. Key lines like bread sauce and cranberry were either empty with replen stock on the floor or top shelf. I chose to unpack my own to glares from a colleague! Most of the staff were discussing how bad it was to work there and i heard one person so it will imrove in the new year. When arriving at the 2 open till points  there were huge queues. After 10 mins one more till opened and poor chanel had no keys. Apologising and hoping i would pay by card as she couldnt take cash. She was very pleasant but by the time i finished at the checkout the queues were down the aisles. A clearly more experiences colleague tried to get more tills open but said sorry hardly anyones trained and we have no where near enough people employed for xmas. Visible leadership. Nope none! Really really disapointed.;;;;;2016-12-22T23:33:15+0000;1482449595;2016-12-23 00:33:15;4;8;4;0;12;8;6;2;0;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ordered a grocery delivery from click and collect at your Batley store for 4-6pm. I arrived at 4.45pm with my 6 year old to collect my goods to be told I would have no paperwork for at least half an hour (so no idea of substitutions). I accepted this and started loading my shopping. I asked the member of staff where the rest of it was  as it looked sparse and i could identify a few missing items from memory. He rang to enquire  said it would be 10 minutes. I parked up and took my diabetic son for a drink and snack as he was feeling hypo. We returned at 5.45pm to collect the remainder of my shopping  paperwork now available - I discovered a good number of items still missing! The member of staff got the manager on the phone for me who  after listening to my disappointment  noted the missing items and promised them delivering out to me later this evening. Tesco ensured the items arrived 2 hours later  along with a sorry card  box of chocolates and small toy for my son - fantastic gestures! Could you please ensure the female manager in question receives a thank you from me and my family. I understand there had been a major issue with computers and orders being lost/wrong (and a fire alarm) but a desirable conclusion was obtained through going the extra mile. Many thanks.;;;;;2016-12-22T23:01:37+0000;1482447697;2016-12-23 00:01:37;34;11;35;1;47;11;8;3;13;0;33;1;0;0;0;0;0

Either way  our big Christmas shop was delivered on time this afternoon and we re really grateful for how considerate your staff have been with our items. Of the very few subs that were there all of them were replaced with items very much in our favour.

Normally I m very happy and accept any substitutions. My delivery arrived yesterday whilst I was at work and my husband accepted it. Unfortunately chocolate rolls had been substituted for leave them for Santa chocolate rolls and Rudolph cakes  which just won t be the same to leave out for Santa. The finest stuffing substitute I received was also significantly smaller than ordered.  I rang customer services this morning and was told to return them to store as we had accepted them. I know this maybe the correct policy  but the whole point of delivery is not to go in store especially at the busiest time of year. I am happy to store the goods until my next home delivery and return them to the driver then. I am disappointed in customer service response to offer no solution other than go into store.

We rang customer services several times and the first time  the staff said he was on the way. An hour passed and no sign of the shopping  so we rang again and the same staff had said that he hadn t placed our groceries in the van (so  our delivery wasn t on the van  nor on the way). We are very disappointed and frustrated that this has happened. Also  we had a screaming baby waiting to be fed  for which his milk was on the delivery!;;;;;2016-12-22T16:38:31+0000;1482424711;2016-12-22 17:38:31;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I contact Tesco to find out they are now out of stock....and the 2 suggestions are either go to a DIY store and source the spares(! It s part of the toy missing not just the nuts and bolts!) Or I could try and source a replacement myself!

I would like to say that she was very polite and was obviously having a horrible job ringing everyone to tell them that their Christmas food was languishing in the store  never to be seen again.

I have just been in your Winchester Avenue  Exeter store to do some shopping with the intention of putting items in the food bank and once again there is no presence of the food bank collection box/point.  Please can you clarify this is a logistic decision by the charity involved and not one by yourself.  I will be contacting my local food banks and attempt to clarify the situation.  Please can you just check if there is a food bank point permanently. Did I just visit on a day when it had been temporarily removed. Is it a choice by the foodbank charity to manage/withdraw it.  There is ample room in that store to permanently place one regardless of how much is deposited in it and there are many of us in the community who want to support it if it is present  especially this time of year under the current economic climate.  I simply wish to be reliably able to deposit items when I shop  I don t want to either know or get drawn into ins and outs or internal politics of the matter.   Thanks.

They took the time for us to have a photo  the elf sat with the children in the sleigh and Santa stood behind. They really couldn t have been more helpful  caring and professional. There was a craft table too and we took home some fab decorations. In the run up to Christmas this was such a thoughtful and welcome experience.

My mum visited your Bellshill store the other day with my 26 year old disabled sister in her wheelchair to do a bit of shopping only to discover that the trolleys weren t suitable for attaching to her particular wheelchair. Instead of coming home my mum took her and trolley into shop and broke her back pushing a heavy wheelchair and pulling a trolley full behind her and not one member of staff offered any sort of asssistance.  I find that absolutely appalling. The only help my mum received was when she was leaving store going back to car in which a gentleman who was a customer saw her struggling and took trolley to car for her. Really bad customer service....nowhere near as good as M&S where one of the stores employees went around the shop with my mum and a trolley and then helped pack her bags and load shopping Into car. Will be shopping in M&S in future. There customer service is far superior to yourselves;;;;;2016-12-22T12:01:13+0000;1482408073;2016-12-22 13:01:13;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

So as I sat myself on the floor  glass of wine next to me to ease the pain of wrapping present  scissors and cellotape at the ready.  I got started wrapping with lovely looking paper I d bought from your store.  Well it s like painting the forth Road bridge! Sodding cellotape doesn t stick to said lovely paper and when it does 10mins later it s popped off! I got about a dozen presents wrapped last night which took forever. Put them under the tree and low and behold they have all popped open this morning.   I am now going to have to go buy more wrapping paper and start again. 6 sodding rolls of the stuff I bought. It s completely not fit for purpose and I didn t have enough wine in the house to deal with its capers.  Oh and to top it off there is sodding glitter everywhere from it! My house looks like a unicorn has farted all over it! Merry Christmas Tesco.;;;;;2016-12-22T08:34:02+0000;1482395642;2016-12-22 09:34:02;5;10;9;0;19;10;7;3;8;0;5;0;0;4;0;0;0

Tesco you have for the second time this year with my second online shopping manage to disappoint yet again. Waited in last night for my online delivery - no call  no text  no email to say if it was late  if you couldn t deliver - NOTHING! I call you  wait 40mins to get through to someone to be told- sorry we can t deliver when we said we would (surprise surprise) and we can t contact anyone to re arrange the delivery. We will try to speak to someone tomorrow!!! Really Tesco? Is this the best you can do? I have 11 people to feed Saturday and guests arriving tonight and no food because I trusted you (foolish of me perhaps) to deliver at home all the food and drink that I need for the coming days. I have to work today and I am left with an empty fridge....and to all of that you can only say sorry?!???? Really!!! What about the fact that you should care about your customers and the promises you make and not simply be prepared to take their money? You re busy? You can t get to all of the deliveries? Well that is your problem and not mine - don t make so many slots available  employee more drivers and put your customers first!! I m fuming and so annoyed that now due to you lack of care and lack to provide a service I need to go to another supermarket at some point later tonight to try to do a shop that already took me hours to carefully  select on your website.  Very poor and I shall never ever buy with Tesco again! You should be ashamed of letting your customers down like you have!!!;;;;;2016-12-22T07:49:08+0000;1482392948;2016-12-22 08:49:08;1;1;3;0;4;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;2;0;0;0;0

I would just like to say a huge thank you to the lovely lady who has helped me in store this evening. I very stupidly didn t find out her name  and I m sorry for that  because she really does deserve recognition for her assistance tonight.  I did the bulk of my Christmas food shop this evening  but when I paid  half of the club card vouchers I have saved all year  didn t work. The till said they had already been redeemed. I haven t used them  so was more than a little gutted at the prospect of losing out on ¬£47.50 worth of vouchers coming off my bill.  The lady took me to customer services and phoned through to clubcard helpline to try and sort it out.  The lady on the phone was also lovely and did all she could to sort it out for me  but just as we were getting somewhere  the fire alarm in their building started going off and she had to abort my call.  At this point  the helpful lady in store said she would put the vouchers through somehow for me  as I had my children with me and there was no way of knowing how long we may have to wait for the club card lady to call back as promised  if they were being evacuated for a fire alarm.  I really am very pleased and have come away feeling valued as a customer.  Credit where credit is due. People are all too quick to complain these days  but not so forthcoming with praise...and the members of staff that helped me tonight all deserve praise and recognition.  Thank you. üôÇ Merry Christmas üéÑ;;;;;2016-12-21T22:57:09+0000;1482361029;2016-12-21 23:57:09;50;6;51;2;59;6;3;3;4;0;49;1;0;0;0;0;0

Only part of the order arrived so I called yesterday to chase outstanding item.  Item was apparently  lost . After being transferred as it s an ELC order I was assured I would receive a replacement today via Yodel.  I was offered either refund or replacement but as I was promised next day delivery I opted for this. This has not arrived and I am becoming very frustrated now.  This item is a Christmas present for my Son. Just to add; Your customer services are very poor and I actually had to check I hadn t just called someone s house.

You think that by paying a premium for a christmas delivery and that it is only 4 days to go that you would get food in date.

Tesco will remove this very quickly no doubt.   Ordered over 4 weeks ago and due to arrive between 5-6pm today. At 6.30  no delivery  so called help number.  Held in a queue for about 3-5 minutes. The lady I spoke to I have absolutely no complaints about at all. I was informed that my order was going to be late  approx 4 hours. So potentially arriving by 10pm. I  at this point had received no communication whatsoever about the delay.  When I asked why none had contacted me  I was firstly said that a text had been sent to my mobile number. When I said it hadn t  then was told that it was sent to my work s landline. Not possible  as nothing was recorded.   I spent  over the 2 phone calls  approximately 30 mins speaking and holding. I refused the offer of the order being delivered by 10pm  so asked for the order to be cancelled. It was a large Christmas order  so it would take me about 1.5 hours to unpack.  I was then informed that a van had broken down earlier. These things do happen  but I was not informed of any delay. I am distraught. Tesco did offer to deliver tomorrow  but I am away from home all day  so noone at home to take delivery. How could they possibly promise this  as they are fully booked and this would mean letting another customer down which  found totally unacceptable and unfair.   Tesco are refunding me the money already taken off my card  but was informed that this would take between 2-5 days to reach my account. Not good enough  as I know I can pay by BACS and the money is transferred  usually  the same day.  Therefore  I will now have to go out on Christmas Eve to shop and pay for another shopping  as the money taken by Tesco will not have been refunded at that point. The home delivery service was a treat so I wouldn t have to do this.  When I pointed this out the obvious problem  I was informed that it would take 2 days. Still not any good  re expensive time of the year. Money doesn t grow on trees.   I honestly think Tesco have over booked  putting money ahead of customer satisfaction and think they have the edge  as customers won t cancel their orders because they have no choice. We do have the choice.  Poor Tesco employees  - customer services  pickers  packers  drivers. All who have had problems today and I am only 1 customer.  Tonight the driver will have to unpack the crates and pickers will spend a few hours putting food back on shelves. Hope the frozen food is put back in freezers immediately or will not be fit to eat and same for fridge food. It may have to be put in a skip!   Not good enough Tesco. Bitterly disappointed. You have lost a loyal customer for good. Christmas plans have been spoilt at his end.  I had everything in hand and was starting relax. Merry Christmas;;;;;2016-12-21T20:06:11+0000;1482350771;2016-12-21 21:06:11;1;10;1;0;11;10;6;4;15;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I started my Christmas shopping in August  when you had a huge toy sale on. I spent nearly ¬£150  ¬£75 of which was my son s main present  a Ninja Turtles sewer lair. I collected the order on the 31st of August and immediately took them to a relative s house so that I wasn t tempted to give them to my son for his birthday  which I had already finished buying for.  Fast forward  I picked the boxes (2 in total) up from the house and opened them to wrap them last night and there was no sewer lair in sight. One box had 8 items in  which were dispatched together. However  the second box should have had two items in  as they were dispatched together  and it didn t. I wasn t given the ¬£75 main present.  I went to my local store and they called Tesco direct. I was told it was solely my responsibility and they categorically would not do anything. Just what you want 4 days before Christmas. I then spoke to a manager  who was just as stern  again  my fault. I believe it is fairly obvious the reason why I am only contacting Tesco now  but apparently that is my fault and my fault alone.  I ended up putting the phone down as we were going round in circles. Thanks a lot Tesco  one four year old boy s main present down.;;;;;2016-12-21T15:05:12+0000;1482332712;2016-12-21 16:05:12;1;4;3;0;7;4;1;3;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;2;0

I usually like to go to the Celtic game then do my weekly shop in Tesco and thousands of other fans use the store before and after the game too. I also use Tesco in Renfrew or Linwood for my other grocery shopping on non match weeks.  I find this threatening letter utterly unacceptable.   I will no longer be using any of the above Tesco s and thankfully there is an Asda in both Linwood and Parkhead that doesnt send callous letters for using their facilities.   Might I suggest a review of this situation as many other Celtic fans are stopping using Tesco now not just on match day.;;;;;2016-12-21T15:02:29+0000;1482332549;2016-12-21 16:02:29;4;9;5;0;14;8;4;4;6;0;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

My mother ordered shopping from you to be delivered last night for over Christmas. Money is tight this year so she had saved her Clubcard vouchers for  The big Christmas shop . Both of us were really looking forward to having food for over Christmas. BUT she received a phone call last night to say that her shopping will not be delivered as her bank had declined payment. She was very confused about this as she had made sure there was enough money in the bank to pay for our food. The shopping had come to just over ¬£160  but was reduced by ¬£60 with the club vouchers that has been saved over the year. Tesco had told her that to make payment she would have to have the full amount the shopping came to before the vouchers being applied!!!!! This doesn t make sense as if you would go to a shop to have the exact same food and use the vouchers  you wouldn t need over ¬£160 to spend on shopping that only comes to ¬£100 with vouchers!!!  The delivery for the food was supposed to be between 4 and 5  Tesco had phoned at 3:40! in my eyes this is a very late to let your customers know that the food shop will not be delivered  and at this time of the year only being 5 days away from Christmas  this short notice is not enough. Now we will have to go food shopping in a mad rush to try and get some food for over the Christmas period. And with shops being manic and a stressful place to be in  the last thing I wanted to do was to go shopping for food  when it SHOULD  have been delivered to us.   This has left us both stressed  upset  without food and angry due to what has happened. We have always done our shopping with you  and we have always gotten our Christmas shopping delivered to us. We are not impressed at all with this situation.   So a BIG thank you  to you Tesco. Have a Merry Christmas  and a Happy New Year!;;;;;2016-12-21T12:54:00+0000;1482324840;2016-12-21 13:54:00;0;13;7;0;20;12;9;3;11;0;0;0;0;0;0;6;0

His name was John (he s a grandfather) and he was SUCH a lovely man! Deserved a medal for lugging my Christmas food shop up the path (I m catering for my sister s 40th on 27th so lumped that food in too - immense!). He did it with a huge smile on his face  a big hello  a lovely little chat with my 4 year old. He didn t rush me in unpacking and made sure I was really happy with everything. I only had 1 substitution out of 77 items (never have more than one or two on any order!).  When it was time to go  he asked me out of earshot of my LO if it was ok to give her a chocolate lolly as a little present  making sure she didn t have any allergies etc (he had fruit lollies as a back up just in case!). He asked if we had any more children and left one for my son as well. The nicest part though..... he d bought them himself to take out on his rounds this week for all the children  out of his own pocket!!  Please let him know how lovely he is. I did ring your customer service line and tell them what a great ambassador he is for your company but not sure if it gets passed on.  I presume he works in Pitsea store as I m advised that s where home deliveries come from to the Southend area.  Thank you John for brightening up my day!

We placed an order for the one present they really wanted back in October which was a trampoline   We collected this from the Brownhills store and took it home assuming that a top 5 retail giant would ship items correctly. A few weeks later for some reason I checked the box and found that the order had been picked incorrectly  The trampoline comes in 2 parts  box 1 and box 2 however rather than send one of each box they had sent 2 box ones meaning we had 2 trampolines but no instructions  safety netting or other important parts.  We took this back to the store and returned both boxes as advised (no problem  mistakes happen) expecting to receive a new trampoline.  When the new delivery arrived  again it was wrong ‚Äì two box ones had again been sent  Back it goes again  3rd time lucky!  3rd delivery arrived ‚Äì you‚Äôve guessed it exactly the same again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.  Now I appreciate mistakes happen  we all make them  but to take the same mistake 3 times is an absolute joke  Now this is where I start to get really annoyed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  We are now being told the item is out of stock and have been asked if we want a refund. WHAT USE IS A REFUND 4 DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS?  I‚Äôve spoken to numerous people in the Brownhills store who have been really helpful  but when they ring to try and rectify it they just keep getting fobbed of  my fianc√© has rang the customer service line and again been fobbed off with ‚Äòyou can have a refund or wait till the item is back in stock‚Äô ‚Äì that‚Äôs great customer service adviser  are you going to come round and explain to the kids Christmas morning?  I‚Äôve just got off the phone to the head office customer service number  the guy I spoke to (Usman) was again really helpful and apologetic but couldn‚Äôt resolve the issue for me.  I‚Äôm now awaiting a phone call from Usman‚Äôs supervisor Nicola to ring me back  being honest I can see what will happen ‚Äì I will be offered a refund that‚Äôs if I even get a call  I‚Äôve suggested a simple solution ‚Äì if the 8 foot trampoline is out of stock  send me the 10 foot one ‚Äì yes I know it‚Äôs more expensive but surely ¬£30/40 isn‚Äôt going to hurt after all of the hassle I‚Äôve been through  Not once have I been offered any sort of compensation for the hassle I‚Äôve been through or the cost I‚Äôve incurred in petrol and phone calls  let alone the time I‚Äôve waster ‚Äì GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE‚Ä¶.  So Tesco  you‚Äôve got 3 days to avoid 2 kids Christmas‚Äôs being wrecked by your utter incompetence and also save a customer who spends ¬£400/¬£500 a month with you ‚Äì Do you think you can rise to this challenge ‚Äì Personally I‚Äôm not convinced‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  Finally Tesco  ask yourself this question‚Ä¶.What would you and your buying team be saying/doing if a supplier had delivered something wrong 3 times in a row and then weren‚Äôt resolving the issue in a satisfactory fashion?   #Tesco #Operationalshambles #whathappenedtoputtingthecustomerfirst;;;;;2016-12-21T12:08:23+0000;1482322103;2016-12-21 13:08:23;8;4;9;1;14;4;2;2;2;0;7;0;0;0;0;1;0

Firstly I must say how impressed I was with the helpfulness / friendliness of staff and how all the shelves were being restocked to capacity despite the vast number of people in store. No sooner than I had selected two packets of pastry  was someone refilling the gap! Altho it was busy  the experience wasn t a hellish as id imagined! Your carpark on the other hand.... As mentioned in a mum of a small baby so spent 15 minutes driving around waiting for a mum&child spot to become free. You only have a few so I know it was a long shot! I gave in and parked in the widest spot I could find. Struggled to free the baby from his car seat without knocking the car next to me and went inside. Upon returning to my car I was now parked next to another car clearly with children inside (visible car seats & toys) and you ve guessed it  I ve been  dinged  while I m annoyed  I can totally understand how it happened so can t be too angry at that poor mum / dad. There I am  fighting and struggling to get my baby safely back into his car seat without causing damage and not one but THREE couples are retuning to cars parked in the mother&child spaces! I let the first one side  the second I shot a look and when the third made a comment about how tight the spaces were and to be careful  I d had enough.   It is when people park in the mum&baby  spots all the time  - I said with a smile! This Middle aged couple  no baby or child  were parked in a space specifically wider for loading / unloading small people  the 40 something year old lady looked and me and shouted  oh f*ck off  I quickly looked around in search of an employee or anyone incase things turned nasty but as no one was around I finished loading my baby and left.  I understand you can t stop these kinds of obnoxious  self centred people visiting your store but maybe some form of carpark patrol might be in order?!  You d be quick enough to ticket someone parked in a disabled spot without the correct permit  so maybe a gentle remind to those using the mum&baby spots that they are there to HELP mums  not save their nice car doors!   Mum & baby spots are hard enough to come by at the best of times I know  but a little consideration from others world go a long way for mums and their children.;;;;;2016-12-21T08:34:50+0000;1482309290;2016-12-21 09:34:50;4;2;4;0;6;2;2;0;0;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

It was through a partner company who are allowed to sell on Tesco website. They are called Box.co.uk. I ve been a loyal Tesco shopper for many years so didn t see a problem with this  Tesco are a trusted name and I ve never had any problems with Tesco in the past. It was a click and collect purchase which was meant to be delivered to a local store. I had all the details  just had to wait for an email to say the store had received the item. On the day of delivery I received a call from the delivery driver of a well documented firm who s name begins with a Y and ends in odel. This was the first warning sign  how could Tesco use such an inept company to safely deliver their parcels?? The driver said he could not find my house... I had to explain to him that he was meant to deliver to a Tesco store and I would collect it. He said he d do it. I awaited the email to inform me that I could collect the item but it never arrived in my inbox. I decided to go to the store anyway  after all - I d been told by the delivery driver that my parcel would be delivered that day. Got to the store and they could not find the item. Another warning sign. I explained the situation  what the item was and where it had come from and eventually they located it. I took it home and presented it to my fianc√©e as her lovely new laptop for her birthday. She opened it up and switched it on only to find that the text on screen was Italian. Another warning sign. No worries I thought  just change the language to English. Well  the keyboard has numerous Italian symbols (letters with accents) and the other symbols (@  ?  etc) are all in the wrong place so do not correspond with what you type. I called Tesco direct who did not help in the slightest. They told me to  google  box. Box? I said. Yes  Box she said. It will come up on google and you ll have to deal with them. Another warning sign... I started to get a little worried. I googled box only to find hundreds of results which had nothing to do with who I was looking for. Another warning sign. Anyway  I eventually found their website. They don t have a telephone number for customer service  only for sales who do not deal with anything after the point of sale. Another warning sign. I read some reviews and immediately regretted ever buying through Tesco direct  I won t make this mistake again in a hurry. I eventually found a  call back request  form which I fully completed. This was over a week ago and I m yet to speak to anyone at box. I have however had email correspondence with someone. She emails me one day  I respond  then I receive an answer a full 24hrs later  then I respond and the cycle continues... Its been over a week and my complaint had not moved very far at all. She told me she s arranged for dpd to collect the laptop as they need to inspect it. Collection was arranged for Monday 19th between 9-5... My fianc√©e took the day off work but nobody arrived to collect it. I had to email three times to get a response to which they said  sorry about that . I have lost all confidence in Tesco and have had this foreign laptop (not described like this on Tesco direct!!) since 9th December. That is a complete disgrace. I have pleaded with box for a refund but they are not playing ball. I paid for it using my Tesco credit card and I d like a refund ASAP so that I can find a replacement laptop before Christmas. For anyone reading this  please be careful when buying from Tesco direct. You are not always buying from Tesco but from some cowboy company that they have partnered with. I m shocked that Tesco would allow themselves to be associated with these companies who s customer service is appalling  along with the reviews!!;;;;;2016-12-21T00:41:47+0000;1482280907;2016-12-21 01:41:47;4;16;7;0;23;16;7;9;10;0;4;0;0;0;0;3;0

I asked him if he would give them to a shelter or food banks he let me know that it was a against your policy to give away food that was not bought and now the bins that they are thrown in to are locked as to deter people from trying to do so. I am horrified at the fact that a huge corporation doesn t do anything to help it s most vulnerable members of the community when it clearly has the resources and means to; that a corporation would rather see a waste in food than see it s local people fed. Is there actually a policy on the preference to throw food away rather than save it for those who could use and benefit from it (referring to the assumed masses of food not just surrounding pastry goods providing it doesn t cause harm)?

Particularly two members who were stacking the Christmas gift section yesterday evening (19/12). My mother works at John Radcliffe Hospital and as a last minute idea she was granted a budget to go and buy gifts for the patients on the ward that she works on. We spotted the Lynx Africa sets were on offer which were perfect and in budget so we cleared the shelf  when a staff member asked if we would need any more as she had lots more stock. We said yes please to some more and asked if they had anything for the females  as there was little stock out  she said that she would go and have a look. Two members of staff returned with a whole crate of Lynx and Nivea gift options. We took 20 of the Nivea gifts and 14 Lynx sets.  Would just like to say thank you to those two  unfortunately we didn t catch names but they were MOST helpful in providing us gifts and they went above and beyond.  Merry Christmas!

I was offered a reschedule to then be told there were no more slots until after Christmas  my only option was a refund and a good will voucher of ¬£15. I wasn t offered the option on pick and collect at my local store! My reason for ordering online is because I m 38 weeks pregnant and I m having hip pain  not so easy to walk and do a food shop! I was left with no shopping and having to wait up to 3 days for my refund. Pretty poor customer service  why wasn t I called before my scheduled delivery slot? I used to work in retail and know that a driver has to be there well before his/her first drop to do van checks and then load. Instead of calling before they left it until 9:22pm. Unacceptable. I wasn t called then until mid Monday morning to say a special van would be coming out to deliver my shopping. Same delivery slot  it then was 15mins later than my allotted time! I ve been charged a further ¬£2.00!! And not forgetting I m actually missing 2 items from my shopping! Not happy at all! You need to sort your customer service management out! A call should have come out before my delivery slot and I should have at least been offered pick and collect! Not so sure I trust to use your services again!;;;;;2016-12-20T14:26:48+0000;1482244008;2016-12-20 15:26:48;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

So.....today  9 working days later  still no refund. Your member of staff today has been helpful  and found that in fact the funds were never claimed by Tesco  but are still held as  reserved  at my bank. I have lost my clubcard vouchers until Feb 2017  so a refund of the amount spent on them has been made. The bank are being asked to release my funds....all because  apparently  I cancelled TOO QUICKLY!  I m told that the money will be back with me today or tomorrow  and that I will be reimbursed for the cash value of the vouchers I used (but not their enhanced value if used on certain offers).

My car battery died  I was trapped amongst cars who were clearly there for the long haul. Eventually  after sitting waiting in the vain hope some knight in shining armour would come and help me out  I went to customer services where they managed to get me the lovely Shona (a dot com driver) who rustled up another male colleague and they came and jump started my car.

How could you design such cute wrapping paper.  With its cute reindeer and pretty sparkles  I fell for its charms.  This year with 3 older teens and a 4 year old to keep in suspense for their Christmas gifts  I decided I would wrap all present in the same gorgeous paper.  Well....now I fully regret my choice and wish I had not been lured in to the glittery trap.  I made the error of wrapping presents on my bed...huge mistake.  My room looked like an explosion in a glitter factory and even though I washed the covers and hoovered  yes hoovered my bed...my husband and I woke in the morning looking like Bradley and Ottavio from X-Factor.  I then had to do the school run and shopping with a very sparky face before I could even attempt to wash it off in the shower.  And that was only round one.  Round two  I thought I d put a sheet down first.  It saved the carpet but on shaking the sheet out side  I panicked that I would confuse dear old Rudolph himself into thinking Santa s clock might be late.  It s in my eyes  Tesco.  It s on my clothes and just about everywhere I look.    And guess where I work and what I have to sell everyday...TESCO!!! what strength it takes not to scream   DONT DO IT.  STAY AWAY FROM THE SPARKLES  to every customer that falls for its beauty.  I shall send you a bill for the extra washing and hoovering for both wrapping sessions and ...  OH MY GOODNESS!!!!  IT S ALL GOT TO COME BACK OFF ON CHRISTMAS DAY.  AHHHHHHHGGHHHHHHH!!!!!;;;;;2016-12-19T18:11:49+0000;1482171109;2016-12-19 19:11:49;392;523;650;66;1239;513;305;208;352;0;391;19;1;234;2;1;0

I noticed that the menu had changed and sausages weren t an option but did notice that on the kids menu  you offered burger chips and peas. You also offered a full all day breakfast including sausages on the main menu. As my son is a fairly fussy eater and specifically asked for sausages  I asked the gent at the till if I could swap the burger for sausage(s) and got quite a blunt  no  in reply. He explained that till has no option to make changes to the meals and quite clearly wasn t prepared to speak to the chef to ask to ask the for sausage instead. I was really quite shocked that he refused to make the swap. I wasn t asking for anything for free and I was only asking for something that every other supermarket cafe does accommodate. Essentially  no parent can buy sausages for their children despite them having sausages available  or make any amendments to any meal on the menu due to the till. The gent I happened to speak was called Jason and his name badge stated he was the manager. I am surprised he will have any customers in his cafe if he speaks to customers the way I was spoken to. Needless to say  you won t be getting any further custom from me based on the poor menu choice and customer service.;;;;;2016-12-19T17:51:49+0000;1482169909;2016-12-19 18:51:49;0;7;0;0;7;7;4;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was in your store very recently (Blandford Forum super store).  I was horrified  (and trust me  not a lot rattles my cage ) to see that the AED (automated external defibrillator)  fitted inside the store  has been blocked off by a huge Christmas tree and  a charity collection box.  What on earth is the thinking in this?? This piece of life saving equipment has been virtually forgotten behind a huge box and a tree. I was filled full of dread. There were staff about but I just couldn t speak as I wanted to be taken seriously. So I m here :) If someone suffers a full cardiac arrest  you have four minutes before they ll suffer brain damage. Ten minutes before they are unsavable. CPR alone will not save a person s life. It s called basic life support for  a reason. It will support basic function  but without an ambulance  a paramedic  or a member of the public using one of these AEDs  (which thankfully you need no training for  as it will walk the user through) someone will die.  I know these AEDs have saved lives where otherwise there would have been no hope. Please  please  please get the tree and other things out of the way.  You wouldn t put a tree in front of a fire exit (I d hope!) This is the same.  Please sort it out <3 (Happy Christmas xxxxxxx);;;;;2016-12-19T07:30:27+0000;1482132627;2016-12-19 08:30:27;8;5;8;1;14;5;3;2;4;0;8;0;0;0;0;0;0

I said u could get yourself a Christmas card from me otherwise I don t think you will get one (felt a bit bad about this) anyway he left to do the shopping. He got to the checkout and asked the lady once she put the shopping through whether she would mind going to pick a card for him as I was unable to do so myself.. She replied  of course I will  she even put it in a few bags so my partner wouldn t see it. I d just like to say thank you to her because it now means he has a card which he doesn t know about which makes me feel a lot better!

I have always used pampers but this particular time we are away visiting family and as the Tesco store didn t have the size pampers I require in stock i purchased your own brand.  On the Tesco brand nappies it clearly states in bold pictures on the front of the Packet  soft against baby s skin  which clearly isn t the case as the wee that has been absorbed into the nappy has hardened into hard lumpy crystals that have caused sores and blisters on both my babies bottoms. One of the twins started screaming and was restraining herself from sitting down... once we took the nappy off it was clearly apparent straight away why she was in such discomfort as her bottom was red raw with skin pealing off  my daughter was screaming in agony! Her twin brother was also red raw but not as bad as his twin sister. We have put cream on both babies and purchased a packet of pampers and hope to see some improvement by the morning. We have taken photos for evidence and kept the nappies if you need these for further investigation.;;;;;2016-12-18T21:43:37+0000;1482097417;2016-12-18 22:43:37;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I bought my cards and wrapping paper with my weekly Tesco shop this year and the designs were just BEAUTIFUL. I got some very cute and rather amusing Christmas cards  with fat cats looking like baubles and Christmas puddings  with a nice glitter detailing - my 4 year old son LOVED these and gave them to his teachers  thinking they were very funny! The gift wrap I picked up was stunning and I purchased several rolls which were full of festive sparkle  covered was glittering designs of Christmas trees  snowflakes and reindeer..

Yet another reason to support YOU!   Tesco logo ¬© Info Tesco has supported us for the past decade. It has donated over ¬£10 million in financial support to our emergency appeals. The partnership began in 2007  when we were Tesco‚Äôs Charity of the Year. Since then  our engagement has deepened to include an emergency agreement that supports our work both in the UK and overseas. In the UK  our emergency response teams are able to request items from Tesco stores that help us support people in crisis. This can mean supplying pallets of bottled water to a Red Cross rest centre following an incident such as an evacuation from a block of flats or providing food for residents isolated in their homes by severe weather or flooding. Ten years after Tesco made a major donation following the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004  it became a founding member of the Disaster Relief Alliance ‚Äì a British Red Cross initiative. The Disaster Relief Alliance aims to bring about closer engagement with the private sector in our humanitarian activities  providing financial support before crises occur.;;;;;2016-12-18T09:36:17+0000;1482053777;2016-12-18 10:36:17;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Today  two days before delivery and one week before Christmas  I went to add to my order only to find next to the turkey I ordered  Tesco no longer sell this item . I can t even order a fresh one as it says it is no longer available for pre order. I rely on my Tesco delivery  being 30 minutes away from a store and because I am away for a few days before Christmas  I will be unable to get a turkey elsewhere. I thought the idea of a Christmas week delivery slot was for the necessary supplies to be delivered.

Last January I purchased a Dyson from this store and today it stopped working so I took it back into store and went to customer service desk. I waited a few minutes in the queue to be pushed infront of by a member of staff on duty. I was told that I had to go up to the electrical desk and speak to them. The man on the electrical desk was only interested if I had purchased the extended warranty and gave me a leaflet  he had no idea what the process was for returning faulty goods and just told me to ring a number. I wasn t very pleased with the lack of information I had received so I went back to customer services to ask if there was anything that could be done in store. The lady working on the desk was apologetic and said that it was up to the people on the electrical desk and that there was nothing she could do. As far as I am aware electrical items have a 1 year warranty as standard and according to the consumer rights act 2015 the responsibility to repair or exchange faulty items is the stores not the manufacturer. It also states in your returns policy that if an item if found to be faulty within 12 months you guarantee a repair  exchange or full refund.

She went out of her way to provide products in original outer packaging to help with carrying on my repeated trips  opened an extra checkout to speed up service for me to prevent holding up other customers. Service levels are generally slipping across all companies. Was great to see she  along with her colleagues smiling  being extra helpful and engaging with customers during this busy and stressful time for retail workers. Please pass on to the appropriate. A big Happy Christmas to you and you colleagues üéÑ üéÅ üîî üéÖ üè™ ‚ùÑ üçó;;;;;2016-12-17T18:26:16+0000;1481999176;2016-12-17 19:26:16;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I used the small photo machine i payed and when it started printing in got jammed! I had 3 young kids with me board I went to try and find someone they said I had to queue at customer services which i did for 5mins then he said here s the manager I got out of the queue to go to machine where she was for her to say the machine has nothing to do with us you have to call the number I can t help you I phoned them for them to say that I have to go to customer services tell them take my receipt and they refund me and that they have told Tescos this before and they should all know so how did the MANAGER not know!! So I queue again to then be told by the lady at the counter she doesn t know she then had to phone the place and it turns out there is a selection on there tills that do refunds for the photo machines!!! So in total the whole thing took me bout 30 mins with 3 grumpy board children!!!! I saw the manager I told her so she knew so no one else had to have the same problem for her just to say ok ok and look at me in disgust!!! I take my son to Surrey sports centre every Monday and Friday and go into that store at least once a week!!

I was delighted to discover that I had the option to pick a date for delivey and that today s date was available. I was happy to pay the ¬£5.95 for delivery.  I was advised my order had been received and would be delivered between 7am and 7pm today.  I was ready and waiting for delivery by 7am today.  No boots.  I checked my email and discovered an email from DPD advising they had not received the order from Tesco but would update me as soon as possible.  I waited.  No boots.  I checked on the DPD website via an emailed link which now tells me that my parcel was in Birmingham at 9.35pm and would be on its way to the Uddingston depot shortly. It also said at the bottom that my boots will not be delivered until Monday the 19th December.  I have paid ¬£5.95 to pick a date for delivery for Tesco to pick their own date.  I have hospital appointments on Monday and have no intention of missing my appointments in order to allow Tesco to deliver my item on a date I didn t pick.  I am extremely unhappy.  If you can t deliver until Monday you should state that at the time and allow me to make the informed decision t take my custom to someone who can.;;;;;2016-12-17T01:14:25+0000;1481937265;2016-12-17 02:14:25;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Just wanted to let all my friends know about the Christmas tree in the door way of Tesco with all the children s names and ages on. These are all the children in the area who do not receive a present on Christmas morning. You take a tag from the tree and buy them a gift to open at Christmas. I don t have much money but Olivia Yates Harrison Yates and I have each bought a few gifts for 3 children to open on Christmas morning. I m not posting this for a  well done   I am making people aware. (I only found out about this last week!!!) imagine if every shopper took a tag from the tree and there were none remaining?!!! How fabulous to think every child in the area was able to open a present??? Please share and make everyone aware. What s a couple of extra pounds on top of your Christmas shopping bill??? It s the difference that will bring happiness and smiles to the child you bought for. Do these children think they don t get a present because they have been naughty all year??

All the aisles were packed with cages from one end to the other. Some aisles I couldn t even manoeuvre down or reach to the shelves due to the volume of cages. I accept that during the quiet evening period this is a good time to replenish shelves but please remember your store is still open and there are customers still shopping. Anyway  one particular aisle I went down a female member of staff started to pull a cage backwards so I move back and stand and wait for her to pass by us  but instead of moving the cage that was in her way she bashed the cage into my trolley! I shout out  woah   yet she continues pushing it after looking at me  and pushes the trolley handle into my 6 year old daughters neck and chest crushing her between the end of the aisle and my trolley. I had to ram the trolley forward to move the cage away and when I complain to this member of staff she just walks off! üò° After turning down into another aisle I could hear her telling another member of staff that I  was complaining?! I have every reason to complain about her behaviour as she had just injured my daughter and proceeded to be rude about it. I found her behaviour completely unacceptable and I expect better from staff especially while the store is still open to customers like myself.;;;;;2016-12-16T23:34:27+0000;1481931267;2016-12-17 00:34:27;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I do not wish myself or other coeliacs be made feel marginalised and segregated further. I made a verbal complaint to two lads picking in the same isle and the said they were surprised themselves. The customer service desk lady also said I wasn t the first to complain and that she found it shocking and embarrassing that we would have to find our food in the pharmacy and toiletries section. I ve informed Coeliac UK both local branch and national HQ.;;;;;2016-12-16T17:35:29+0000;1481909729;2016-12-16 18:35:29;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My son fell over and hurt his lip in your store. As soon as he saw the blood he was hysterical. A member of staff was with me in seconds to ask what she could do to help  (sorry didn t get her name) while the promtional Lindor lady was already off getting me tissue.  When I asked for a cold compress  a first aider was called and I didn t get one  I got 5 within 10 seconds. One was getting ice for my son  while one was stopping the bleeding  one went off to get his favourite sweets and the other two asked if there was anything they could do to help. Tonita (who was awesome) stayed with us the whole time and the Lindor lady entertained my other two whilst I was consoling my little boy. A manager was also there and asked if she could do anything.  I honestly and still am shocked at how caring they all were. My other two boys ended up walking away with a Lindor bunny rabbit and the injured party got not one pack of sweets but 11. I was so emotional holding back the tears and then got told how much of an amazing person I was and to keep up the good work.   I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart  you were all so professional  calm and simply amazing.;;;;;2016-12-16T16:39:43+0000;1481906383;2016-12-16 17:39:43;19;5;23;0;28;5;3;2;7;0;19;4;0;0;0;0;0

Now I completely understand the stress of working retail  especially during the holiday season - I worked last year during the Christmas season on checkouts so I understand how busy and stressful it gets.   When I had gotten to the checkout with a few items  one of which had a security tag  so I thought it would be quicker to go to a person rather than self scan! The checkout operator I had was elderly  not sure her name. She was absolutely awful with customer s items  throwing it down the belt and not even waiting for them to pay and move before throwing the next customers items down the belt! She d thrown the lady s items so hard in front of me her box of doughnuts  burst open onto the floor. Ignoring my items for a bit I bent down to help her  noticing my own items was still being thrown down the belt with force. The operator then eventually stopped and stood up to scoop up the doughnuts and then started shouting at the lady to get another box herself while demanding me for my Tesco s card! The poor lady in front of me had to abandon her shopping and go and get another box of doughnuts at this point. I paid for my own shopping and turned to tell this operator to have a nice Christmas - and she started complaining to a customer behind me about myself and the lady in front of me! Something about  we don t need slow people at this time of year; people like that slow the whole checkout down!   This is absolutely unacceptable having being in customer service myself! I also suffer with multiple anxiety disorders so shopping in general  especially at this time of year  and going to an operator is a big deal for me  it s not right for your operators to be throwing items down and complaining to people about other customers! This resulted in myself having an anxiety attack. I know it s busy and stressful at this time of year but it s no excuse to treating customers in this manner.";;;;;2016-12-16T13:13:31+0000;1481894011;2016-12-16 14:13:31;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

My daughter rang to say could we please have it delivered to our new address and was told no they could not change it!!!!! How difficult is it to change an address? She has given plenty of notice and it s not rocket science is it?? Go on the system and change the address or give the different address to the delivery driver.

After 3rd call without resolving issue (not really anyone s fault) we were out through to a guy called Ben in the technical department. Well..after about hour and half between us Ben and I resolved the problem which was unbelievably the Turkey crown in the shopping basket was not allowing us to put through order!! The only thing my poor Auntie wanted desperately.  So very long story short we had to give up on the Turkey and order the rest of food and try and get her a turkey elsewhere but....last night she received a call of apology and was told a turkey crown would be included in her order free of charge.  So thank you so much firstly to Ben who had extreme patience And then to tesco for making my aunties Christmas she was do very upset and frustrated but now happy.. Please pass to Ben if you can and to his bosses - this guy is a keeper. Merry Christmas and New Year..;;;;;2016-12-16T09:00:04+0000;1481878804;2016-12-16 10:00:04;5;3;5;0;8;3;1;2;1;0;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

Last Thursday I ordered a next day delivery for a friend who lives 4 hours away as a birthday gift (I know it sounds lame but we are both students and the best gift we can get is food sometimes!). I paid ¬£3 for a delivery slot as well as ¬£4 basket charge on top of the actual shopping so that s ¬£7 just for delivery!  My friend stayed in for the allocated couple of hours on her birthday and waited but nobody came. I had a missed call from an unknown number who I called and text and received a message back saying it was the driver and he had knocked on the door but there had been no answer.  Now  my friend lives in a block of flats so you have to go through a door (which is always unlocked) to knock on her door and knowing she was in waiting felt maybe this was the problem. Rang customer services who contacted him and gave him her mobile number then rang me back to say he was still doing deliveries so would try again on his way back. My friend then had a call to say sorry  but he had  cocked the order up  (very professional) and would have to be tomorrow.  My friend had waited in for 4 hours on her birthday at this point. She then called three times over the course of the next two days  each time being told they would call her back and never did. Due to being a nursing student on placement I only managed to get hold of her this Tuesday - 3 days later! - for her to tell me that it had never come and nobody would return her calls. Just before 9pm Tuesday night I rang customer services again very upset that this had still not been delivered and neither of us knew what was happening.. the guy was very nice and understood my frustration and said he would call me back. Which he did.. to tell me that unfortunately  because it was coming to the end of the night  they had already closed down all the tracking systems- 2 hours before customer services close! So could I please call back tomorrow. I couldn t call back tomorrow as I was at the hospital all day and today have discovered that I received an email saying Tesco are  pleased to confirm my refund  days ago!  So in short : my delivery was not delivered on the day it should have been. No effort was made to try and redeliver and in fact efforts made by the customer were ignored  customer service apparently shut down their systems two hours before the end of their shift  and not only does my friend not have her birthday present even a week after(!!) But my order has been cancelled and refunded without me even being consulted!  I m not sure if there is any other way your customer service could have failed in this situation and I am thoroughly appalled and frankly  quite upset! I now have to order her something else for her birthday and a little something extra to make up for missing it!;;;;;2016-12-15T23:17:25+0000;1481843845;2016-12-16 00:17:25;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

A day later there was a ring at the door and there was my turkey - compliments of the manager.

As a 3 year old it can be tough having to go shopping with your Mummy after a long day at nursery but my son was trying his best to be well behaved and find everything we needed  he even helped carry the basket and gave the broccoli a stroke. We were helped by a lovely lady (I m sorry  I didn t find out her name but she had a lovely smile  went out of her way to be helpful and had a few piercings if that helps identify her).  She helped us find everything we needed  even though Mummy was a bit frantic by the amount of times we d discussed which cakes Nannar had bought him last time she visited and helped him decide which magazine was required (it can be difficult to choose a favourite reading between Peppa Pig and Go Jetters  Mummy frankly thinks you offer too many choices!)  The very kind lady told my son where she d hidden the squash and special offers on pizza before she waved us both goodbye and wished George (my son) a Merry Christmas on the way out. As I mentioned before Mummy was having a hectic moment when we visited your store  it had been a busy day at work  a long journey back to nursery to pick her little man and lots of idiot drivers on the way there which she had been unable to express her utter contempt for as she had her lovely son in her car and her feelings towards said drivers were not appropriate to be shared with a 3 year old. As a result we didn t manage to express to the kind lady just how much easier and enjoyable she d made our visit Tesco so I m hoping that you would be able to do that and pass our thanks and best wishes for the Christmas season to her. We both hope she has a lovely Christmas and New Year and thank you for being so lovely when we visited today.;;;;;2016-12-15T21:14:22+0000;1481836462;2016-12-15 22:14:22;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I phoned your customer service line in order to cancel these selected items and the gentleman took a note of them and informed me that his system was down and that he d rectify it ASAP and inform me when he had done so. This order was ¬£137. I later visited your tesco extra store in Newmarket. Me and my partner were very hungry and thought we d have a meal in the restaurant there. We ordered lasagnes to be told there was none left. I chose a jacket potato with beans and cheese and my partner ordered a burger meal. When my jacket potato arrived it looked like it had been sat around all day (this was 3pm roughly). Even the lady who served it said she wouldn t eat it. I asked to replace it with a burger instead. When my partners burger meal arrived the burger was so cold the cheese couldn t melt  the chips were like warm and the bun had a black charcoal like crust around the outside. We asked for a refund and went to do some shopping instead. We then spent around ¬£115. When I got home I checked my emails as I hadn t heard about the cancelled items  I phoned your customer service line again to discover the gentleman hadn t cancelled them at all and now it s too late to cancel at least 1 item. I have spent over ¬£200 with you today even with the 3 cancelled items just to receive awful customer service.

I was going to the toilet and was about to go into the disabled toilets when a member of staff said in a sarky tone that s the disabled toilets!! It actually upset me as I have an ileostomy and am entitled to use the disabled loos!!! It says on the door of the disabled toilet that not all disabilitys are visible!! I complained about the lady in Question to her supervisor who took her off the till to have a word with her and assured me other members of staff would be told too!! I actually lifted up my top and showed the supervisor lady my ileostomy bag and explained it s hard to go out some days and when I get a sarky comment like that for using a toilet I m actually entitled to use it makes me want to stay home!!!  It upset me and I think more people should be aware of this and don t judge before you know! The supervisor could not apologise enough to me so credit to her!;;;;;2016-12-15T18:55:49+0000;1481828149;2016-12-15 19:55:49;2;30;3;0;33;30;8;22;17;0;2;0;0;0;0;1;0

On Tuesday at Wolverton  Milton Keynes  we bought a week s supplies.  This included two new to us products - Chinese Meal for Two and Beef Casserole.  The Chinese comprised prawn crackers  spring rolls  egg fried rice  sweet and sour chicken and chicken with cashew nuts.  The spring rolls were almost entirely pastry with minimal filling.  The sweet and sour chicken was too sweet  even for sweet and sour  with too little fruit or veg and too much sauce   The chicken with cashews was nearly as sweet as the sweet and sour  which it should never be  mostly sauce and the cashew nuts were very scarce.  The chicken  which the label admitted was from Thailand  lacked texture and flavour and could easily have been mistaken for tofu!  The beef casserole was worse.  The gravy was unpleasantly glutinous and was by far the main ingredient.  The vegetables were lacking in quantity.  But worst of all  half of the beef was inedible due to gristle and sinew.  Much of it went in the food waste bin!;;;;;2016-12-15T16:01:50+0000;1481817710;2016-12-15 17:01:50;0;4;0;0;4;4;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ve never received such appalling service as I did in Tesco  Oldfield Road  Sutton yesterday!!    Firstly  I tried to purchase a pack of car air fresheners but was told by the checkout lady and Customer Services  that I couldn t purchase them because they weren t catalogued/listed so they couldn t be swiped through!!!!  Therefore  the perfect little stocking filler I wanted for my son  was snatched away from me!!  What kind of sales technique/customer service is that?!!!!!   Secondly  having used the large Christmas gift bag I purchased to carry some gifts home in  I was very disappointed that the handles broke before I even made it to the bus stop!  Having traipsed all the way back to the store  struggling to carry the handle-less bag  I went to the  customer service desk AGAIN and the lady I approached showed her colleague the condition of the bag  her colleague grunted at her  which  as she proceeded to process a refund  meant that she granted the refund.  The lady serving me watched me unpack all my shopping from the offending gift bag and put it into another bag  threw the receipt on top of my pile of shopping and thrust the refund at me.  During this time  not a single word was uttered from this lady s mouth  no apology  no offer of assistance and no thank you!!!!  I even tried to make eye contact with the staff member to smile at her but she was completely unresponsive to me!!!!  I m appalled #tescosutton!!!  How can a company who s staff don t have a clue about even the basics in customer service  be making so much profit?!!!!!;;;;;2016-12-15T14:57:39+0000;1481813859;2016-12-15 15:57:39;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Unfortunately my main branch is at Berwick on Tweed. Most of the year this is a peaceful and unstressful place but it has now descended into the madness of last year - but worse. Not only is the bakery section unapproachable because of raucous music but there are tinny yet loud CD players at other points in the shop. ( A mole tells me there are 4 of them) Many people are unable to use the basket till by the entrance because of the raucous noise.It is unwelcoming to be greeted at the door by a barrage of sound. One lady was so distressed the other day that she strode over and turned the wretched thing off. Within a few yards of this  at the Christmas card section  there is another CD player blaring out stressful inanity. Remember the cacophony of separate devices all playing different things. This is the 21st century - isn t it about time Tesco had a comprehensive disability policy and also trained its staff in disability awareness? Some of the new staff seem to have few interpersonal skills. Christmas is unpleasant and stressful for many people. There is no need to add to it inthe hope that you will shore up your falling profits by bludgeoning people into buying by numbing their brains with excess noise. Please send this to the appropriate management section at head office.;;;;;2016-12-15T13:57:50+0000;1481810270;2016-12-15 14:57:50;0;5;0;0;5;5;2;3;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I then panicked thinking how I was secretly going to pay for the toy with my son with me  so Richard offered to take my son round the corner to look at the toys  whilst I paid and got the paw patrol toy wrapped up.

Yesterday evening I visited one of your stores with my one year old son. I work full time and therefore have to shop during peak hours (weekends and evenings). I often shop with him by myself which makes it a bit tricky if spaces near the trolley bays are full.  I would never complain about a lack of parent and child spaces as  when used correctly  there are more than enough. However  last night  I watched a man cut in front of me and take the last remaining parent and child space. I also watched as his (roughly) NINE year old son got out the vehicle and the two of them walked into the store. The rest of the car park was full so I parked at the back  no where near trolleys or the store. I carried my son to the store to put him in a trolley  and when we were done  had to carry him and the bags back to my car. I then had the issue of squeezing him in as someone was parked next to me by this point.  I was exhausted last night and I had just had enough of this. I wrote to your customer services team  however  they called this an  unavoidable problem . I see this so much with parents who park here and one will go in whilst the other stays in the car with the infants (why?!) and parents of much older children who can walk themselves into the store. To me  having these spaces here and not putting a penalty for misuse is just insulting. This issue is not unavoidable and will be affecting thousands of busy and exhausted infant parents every day.  There are penalties for parking in other allocated spaces. Your sign clearly states that the spaces are for use of parents with children under three. Include on that sign that there will be a penalty for misuse. The threat alone would stop so much of this from happening and your parent and child spaces would make shopping that little bit less stressful (which I imagine is the point?). As I said  this is a suggestion as I am not buying your excuse that this problem is  unavoidable .";;;;;2016-12-15T10:34:44+0000;1481798084;2016-12-15 11:34:44;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

An employer has the right  whether or not it is explicitly reflected in the employment contract  to require a worker to work on a public holiday. It is common in industries such as retail or emergency services. We have also heard from hon. Members about other sectors such as hospitality  sport and leisure. Employers can determine when workers take their leave‚Äîfor example  to cover an annual shutdown at work‚Äîand can refuse to give leave at a certain time  but they must give workers the opportunity to take their leave at some point during the leave year. The entitlement should give all workers sufficient time to see their families over the year  although I accept that Christmas and various other times of the year are absolutely associated with spending time with family.  In addition  there are special provisions for shop workers who do not wish to work on Sundays  at least. All shop and betting shop workers can opt out of Sunday working  unless Sunday is the only day they have been employed to work. A shop worker can opt out of Sunday working  even if they agreed in their contract to work on Sundays  by giving three months‚Äô notice.;;;;;2016-12-15T10:25:18+0000;1481797518;2016-12-15 11:25:18;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

With your busy lifestyle I m sure you ll appreciate the little bits of luxury that you get to treat yourself to every now and then. You work hard  your run a family and a home whilst holding down a job (and travelling between Barry Island and Honiton) and sometimes it s nice to give yourself a little something extra.   As you re no doubt aware it s coming up to Christmas time and that means present buying and with that comes present wrapping. Some people love it. They absolutely love it. They ve got the protractors out measuring right angles  scalpels at the ready and could take on the world. Now  I have  a friend  who recently popped in to your local Honiton Tesco store in Devon to purchase the necessary tools including the wrapping paper. We all know that this fancy outer layer to your present can really set the tone. It s like getting a Kinder Egg  you just know it s going to be good. My  friend  decided that day would be treat day. Caution was thrown to the wind. That day luxury wrapping paper was purchased. I ll wait whilst you take a second to get your breath back. Better? Good.   A roll of your 3M Luxury Wrapping Paper was taken home. My god and Sweet baby Jesus those presents were going to look good! As you know   Every little help makes a big difference . This luxury paper was going to seal the deal. Move over Pamela these presents are going to be hot. My  friend  was armed and ready  equipment laid out ready to do this. This is where this real life true story hits a snag. Paper was cut   present sat happily in the middle  tape at the ready. And then. Mr Tape was applied to said Luxury Wrapping Paper. Did it stick? No. Ok  well we all know that some tapes are not as good as others  but it s ok. There was a leading brand in the drawer  unopened all innocent in its packet like our sweet baby Jesus on his birthday. Take two. Paper was cut   present sat happily in the middle  tape at the ready. And then  Mr Tape was applied to said Luxury Wrapping Paper. Did it stick? No. My  friend  kept trying. Time and time again Mr Luxury Wrapping Paper would not accept this sacred bond. At this point there s glitter all over the place like a fairy has ate too many sprouts and has glitter farted spraying it everywhere! Over the floor  over my  friend   glitter in their hair looking like they re off on a night on the town. A Christmas sparkly town.  You can imagine the distress  that one treat  that every little that could help those presents just set the tone. To say dreams were shattered is an understatement. Now my friend has naked presents  and worse  naked Luxury Wrapping Paper that looks like a man on his stag do who fell asleep and the lads shaved his glittery hair off  bald as the sweet baby Jesus on the day he was born.  Please tell me you can help my  friend  and restore their faith in the joy of Christmas  the joy of wrapping presents and the joy of Luxury Wrapping Paper.   We eagerly await your response to our Christmas nightmare.  Many thanks Pete and my  friend  who really is real Lisa Gummer.;;;;;2016-12-14T21:13:39+0000;1481750019;2016-12-14 22:13:39;15;18;23;3;44;18;8;10;14;0;15;2;0;6;0;0;0

I called today to enquire about it and spoke to someone who could not care less about my missing item and told me I would have to contact The Entertainer myself to find out. I said I was not going to do this as I ordered from Tesco and not The Entertainer. He said he would find out for me and ring back. I haven t heard anything.

I usually use the Whitfield store which has been declining in recent months. Today the store was very busy ( approx 5pm) yet only two cashiers were open. The store was strewn with rubbish and the floors were absolutely filthy. I only wanted some milk and a pack of six sausage rolls. The milk I got but only one pack of two sausage rolls were on the shelves that were otherwise completely empty. At 5pm on a Wednesday! I also bought my daughter a Christmas jumper for children in need day on Friday. There was very limited choice and the conveyors belt was so ingrained with dirt I was reluctant to put it on! On leaving the store it was difficult to negotiate my way out through the multiple members  of staff having a chat! Once I got in my car and tried to drive past the petrol station  this was severely hampered by a line of traffic trying to get into the petrol station. This was due to the fact that yet again most of the petrol pumps were closed. Absolutely appalling!;;;;;2016-12-14T18:41:24+0000;1481740884;2016-12-14 19:41:24;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I had purchased a 43 inch Smart TV in the Black Friday deals in November  and since it had been turning itself off and on. I had called up the Tesco electronics helpline where I was told to take the TV back in store where it could be either exchanged or be collected for repair (even though I told said person on the phone I had no transport). I decided to take my 43 inch television on the bus with me  even though it was bulky and weighed a little.  When I made it to the service desk  they had no clue what to do. They had never heard of bringing it back into store and the courier collecting it from there. I told them I had no transport so getting it home was a task. So Mary  one of the ladies behind the desk  rang the electronics help line again where they explained my situation. Then Will  a manager had taken over the phone call and had explained they had no same TV in store and no way of getting it repaired. Will then came off the phone and offered me a refund. I explained I liked the TV and would much rather a repair. He understood.  Then Charlotte  another colleague  decided to call the manufacturer. Within a few minutes she was arranging my TV to be collected for repair just needing me to give my details over. Needing the serial number off the back of the TV she took a photo on her phone for me to read to the person still on the phone. Then everything was done. My TV was going to be repaired.  I thanked them all and was going to be on my way when Racheal  another lady behind the counter offered me a lift home with my TV and to my surprise Charlotte and Sam handed me over a ¬£10 good will gift voucher.  But if anyone was doing the good will it was them.  What a good team of staff you have. Each and every one I met  went above and beyond for me. And I appreciate every bit of it.   Thank you Tescos  Every little did help.;;;;;2016-12-14T17:55:36+0000;1481738136;2016-12-14 18:55:36;3;6;3;0;9;6;1;5;0;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

I made an order online for Christmas gifts on the 30th November  I received the dispatched email on the 2nd dec but never got an email to say delivered to my local Tesco but I thought I would pop in to ask why it still hadn t been delivered 5 days later. My local Tesco told me it hadn t been received there. I called your  helpline  on Monday and spoke to Jonathan  he advised me he could not trace the parcel and he would call my local store to check there and call me back. Jonathan called me back he left a voicemail advising me the parcel was lost and he would resend this. Today I have called your  helpline to progress chase as I hadn t received any email updates. The advisor I spoke to today went through all the say information as I had to go through Monday and I explained I had already gone over this and the parcel should have been resent Monday. I was then told that in fact my parcel was never resent on Monday  my original parcel is lost and both items I ordered are now out of stock and I can have a refund? Errrr what!!! I don t want a refund I want the playmobil I ordered that got lost through no fault of my own! I was then told he would put me on a register for stock alert as it may be back in stock Friday. He then went on to tell me I can call back when I get a stock alert and request it be resent?! What! Really?! So through no fault of my own I call you back again and I m not guaranteed to get the item I have ordered and paid for? Really! Is this acceptable customer service? I don t feel it is  I asked to speak to a manager and his replied he is a manager  I asked the complaints process and I was told to email. I am disgusted in the service I have received on both calls  I even explained to him I can t call Friday and keep checking my emails as my son is in hospital Sunday.

Today s useful subs:  I ordered three products from your Finest (I.e. more expensive) party foods range on 3 for 2. Two items arrive (both vegetarian). The third option was not available (season and shake waffle fries - also vegetarian) and gets substituted with cheap (not finest) chicken goujons (clearly not vegetarian  not even decent quality free range meat). I confused the driver trying to work out how this affected the 3 for 2 and just accepted them figuring they were free and I could find someone who might appreciate them. Looking at my receipt more carefully now  I didn t get the the bloody 3 for 2 anyway and have ended up paying for an item I don t want and can t eat. Why would someone substitute chips for chicken?   Then we get the GF cheese and onion crisp bakes substituted with cheese and ham hock ones.  Surely it would be common sense for packers not to substitute meat free products with meat?!   Not particularly happy with Tesco right now especially after someone from Tesco rang a few weeks back doing a survey asking how happy I was with my deliveries  the drivers  substitutions etc and I mentioned then that the thing that irritated me the most was meat free products being substituted with meat products. I know us vegetarians are frowned upon and get very few decent veggie options but you sending me meat products isn t going to sway me back to eating meat!;;;;;2016-12-14T12:36:50+0000;1481719010;2016-12-14 13:36:50;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We decided to do our Christmas food shopping in your store  at approximately 4:30 my poor wife slipped on banana of all things which was on the floor in the wine aisle  she fell with such a horrible thud causing staff and customers to react.  Mr Adam Monday  member of staff calling for the first aider and showing great concern so hats off to this young man. My wife was helped to her feet by myself then felt sick and dizzy with pain to her right arm and shoulder and to leave the premises immediately for fresh air leaving me to pay for the unfinished shopping  hence no formal report was filed in writing which I might add will be rectified this week.  As a result we both had very little sleep that night and spent most of Sunday in Carlisle A&E. Thankfully there are no broken bones but apparently ruptured ligaments can take longer to heal oh happy days NOT.  With the run up to Christmas and loads to do looking likely I m going to have to leave work a week earlier now to help at home as she can only use her left hand properly.  The reason I m letting you know about this episode is as follows  my wife doesn t like any fuss nor does she like the idea of anyone getting into trouble and above all puts a brave face on  she is sitting here in tears because of the pain and stressing about sorting things out for the family for Christmas.  I m not like my wife  I m absolutely furious. John Morrison.;;;;;2016-12-13T22:08:55+0000;1481666935;2016-12-13 23:08:55;0;9;0;0;9;9;4;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

After completing the sale  no receipt stating my order was printed  still no staff member at the Direct desk so went to the customer service desk who were more than helpful and telephoned a manager for advice...after all this time I was getting closer and closer to having to pick up my daughter so when I was told by the manager Brad Simpkin that I had to just go back to the direct desk and wait ( he was on his break and couldn t be bothered to take 5 minutes to deal with the problem  I had made him aware that I had to leave ) I went back again for a third time to still no staff at the direct desk!! The dismissive way in which my problem was dealt with was just rude and disrespectful and as a manager myself was incredibly angry at the way in which I was treated. My suggestion at this particularly busy time of year would be to take a minute and retrain your managers in how to effectively deal with customers in a polite and concise manner. As this is my local store I will now be shopping elsewhere in the hopes I get a decent level of service.;;;;;2016-12-13T15:43:07+0000;1481643787;2016-12-13 16:43:07;6;9;6;0;15;9;6;3;1;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;0

It s day 7 since the broken bike was picked up  working day 5  and we ve just been told the refund will take another 3- 5 working days. That s almost 2 weeks  so as it stands we have done everything you asked and all that s happened is that we have bought two bikes from you.

The man who delivered my shopping (I didn t catch his name) just cheered my morning right up! I answered the door with a screaming baby in my arms- the man was so kind (I think he could see the steam coming from my ears at this pointüòÇ) and made a point of talking to Angus as he came in with my bags. He then proceeded to carry my shopping into my kitchen for me without even asking. As I was grabbing some bags  he even stopped to chat and laugh with Angus and calm him down!!  Maybe doesn t seem a lot to anyone else but he really made a difference to me this morning so I just wanted him to get an acknowledgement that it was certainly appreciated.

No explanation  no compensation offered until I mentioned it and compensation not sufficient. Was told this will be looked into but I would not receive an explanation as to how my slot was cancelled. Tesco do not care about my custom. The cancelled slot is no longer available. Customer Service Manager informed me that I was one of four customers who had called with the same problem!!  I feel this is a case of my slot has been cancelled because Tesco have overbooked each Christmas slot and are not able to meet the demand.  I booked my Christmas slot at 12.23am on Saturday 3rd December to ensure I got the slot I wanted and now I have nothing ! I was not even offered a click and collect slot as a sorry for the mess up !!!  Very disappointed !!!!!!

It was pretty stressful as 2 week old decided as soon as we walked into the shop that he was hungry & 2 year old was being just that - a 2 year old!  The option for him to have a free apple to eat helped enormously as we started our shop. However as he finished his apple he began to get upset again (not wanting to be sat in the trolley!) we continued until we got to the checkout at which point both 2 week old & 2 year old were pretty hysterical & people were staring! Part of me just wanted to leave my trolley full of shopping & walk out but my stubborn side made me continue! Whilst unpacking the shopping  2 members of staff (management I believe) came over & started to talk to my 2 year old. They asked him what was wrong & he pointed to the  Bob the builder  toy at the end of the isle that he had seen & really wanted. Without a second thought  the staff took this out of its box & handed it to him. My initial thought was of dread - that I now needed to pay for this üò¨ however they would not let me pay for it & continued to talk to my little boy & to play with him whilst I packed up my shopping (jiggling & shhhhhhing the 2 week old in his sling) - they did offer to help with the packing too!  These 2 members of staff turned a very stressful shopping trip into a successful one & I have been wanting to public thank them for their thoughtfulness since the event  but have been a little busy!  I hope that this message gets back to them  it was a man & a woman  I m sure they would remember us  my 2 year old was pretty loud üò¨ Your generosity meant that once back in the car  my 2 year old happily played with his toy whilst I was able to feed my 2 week old.

She is always smiling  even when she is dressed in the most outrageous of costumes and you can see how dedicated she is to helping make an impact on the lives of those less fortunate. I just wanted to give her a mention as this time of year is about giving  so Sadie  I see all that you re doing out there and I hope your company does too. Have a merry Christmas and may that festive magic bring you as much happiness as you re bringing to others. #everylittlehelps;;;;;2016-12-12T19:41:34+0000;1481571694;2016-12-12 20:41:34;26;15;40;5;60;15;9;6;32;0;26;14;0;0;0;0;0

I was at your store in Gaywood  Kings Lynn  clothe shopping with my 12 year old daughter. As she is short for her age I needed her to try on her clothes. The changing room was locked. There was a button which said to press for assistance. I did so. Waited five minutes and pressed again. Still nothing. I walked to a lady standing in front of the till (she had a telephone headset on)  assuming she could help. I told her I d pressed the button twice and still nothing. She then told me the button didn t work. Why no signs? Anyway  she said she d get someone for me. I heard the loud speaker asking for someone to attend the changing room. I waited another ten minutes  still nothing. I asked her again  she put out another call. Waited another ten minutes. Still nothing. Decided to give up. As I walked past her  I told her to forget the call  as I had had enough waiting. Her response of  sorry lovey . Sorry lovey???? No further attempt to help or resolve the problem. I ended up driving to Asda where the staff were more than happy to assist! Very poor show!;;;;;2016-12-12T19:11:22+0000;1481569882;2016-12-12 20:11:22;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

While it is great that you do this  it does kind of bother me that you sell these items at full price - including your profit margin.  Would it be possible for customers to identify items that they have bought for the food bank collection box  and for tesco to sell these at cost?  By all means cover your overheads/staff etc  but if you sell them for cost  maybe people would be more likely to put some items in for those that need help.

Twice you have sent me my monthly savings vouchers after the start date and when I have already done my weekly shop  so I have missed out.   Last month you issued me with a money card to compensate but this time you are telling me that it was a one of goodwill gesture and that this time after just spending ¬£80 in your store you will not honour the ¬£12 voucher that arrived too late to use with my shop. This is not ¬£1 or ¬£2 this is enough to by all months worth of nappies/wipes.  I am now being told I can t complain to anyone else as your twitter employees (probably the same as the people on here) are the end of the line. You have no managers or people higher than those who answer social media posts.   This is what spending ¬£80 week in week out with you gets. No loyalty.   I can see your sending all your lovely online customers nice hampers too. That s great.   Everyweek I shop in your store which is not a pleasant experience  the staff who go round collecting the Internet shopping are rude. Stand around chatting whilst blocking aisles. Your trolleys are dangerous and have no brakes yet show pictures to tell you to enable brakes when you have children in the trolley.   The sole reason I continue to shop in your store is the fact you send out reward vouchers and have a great selection of dairy free products for my son.   However I see no point carrying on spending over a ¬£1000 year with a company who won t even honour vouchers that they send out late.  I ll leave this nice post here for everyone to read.

Last year she managed to save ¬£150 worth of stamps  which bless  she spent it all  at Tesco on Christmas presents for her family and friends. she loved the experience of putting the pound corns in the stamp machine and seeing the stamps coming from the machine and then sticking them in the book and most of all spending them. she would normally get the stamps from little lever Tesco but their machine has been out of action for some time so that s how she ended up going to Farnworth Tesco. My granddaughter went with her grandad she had 42 pound corns and ¬£10 in silver. After she had got 42 stamps she went to customer service and asked if she could exchange the ¬£10 pounds worth of silver for 10 pound corns. her little face when the women said no it s not our policy. By the customer services was not buys at the time. I myself went to store later in the day to make a compliat about Tesco customer serves policy. I spoke to the manager who was unsympathetic towards me granddaughter. I asked if he could give me a web page so I could complain. he said he know it and handed my a little green gard that invited me to do a sUrey with a chance to win ¬£1000.

I just wanted to view my feelings about your Tesco in south wigston. Yesterday (Saturday) it was absolutely diabolical . I always use the scan service  but I had to wait 15 mins before I got s chance  as you had a new person on there who to be fare hadn t a clue! He asked for more help as there must of been at least 10 people waiting. No one helped at all. Your staff particularly at this shop are awful  don t want to help you and standing Looking at their phone rather than help customers. We spend a lot if money in your shops but sometimes don t get the niceness that we should. I do think that some of your staff there are terrible. I could mention names too.

You released dates for click and collect for the Christmas period and I duly booked my slot in the Friday for 16:00 to 18:00 at my local store and thought job done.   Tonight I thought I would start to prepare the Christmas shop and I could not find my slot so I telephoned your customer service line who confirmed the slot was no longer available. The reason why because I did not secure my slot. In order to secure my slot I should have placed an order.   Nowhere in your automated and unpersonalised emails do you state that an order should have been placed to secure the slot. You didn t even mention it on your website when I selected my slot. I hear from your customer service agent that I am not first and probably not the last.   So Tesco your  Every Little Helps  has not helped me in fact the complete opposite but as such I will take my custom (albeit the small amount compared to your turnover) to someone else.;;;;;2016-12-11T18:21:05+0000;1481480465;2016-12-11 19:21:05;1;21;1;0;22;21;8;13;12;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I went in two weeks ago and asked if I could order a rib of people for 8 people  to be collected the day before Christmas Eve. A lady took all my details  double checked that they could offer this service and informed me I could collect it on my desired date. Today I went shopping  as I normally do with yourself ever Sunday  and double checked with your butchers that my order had been received. The lady informed me that I could not preorder meat and they had no record of my order. I am sure you can imagine how glad I am that I double checked and I didn t wait until the 23rd to collect it. I am sure you can imagine the panic that would have been caused. Please could you make sure that all your staff now that this service isn t offered  as I have now got to source meat from elsewhere  adding something back on to my very long Christmas to do list.;;;;;2016-12-11T18:08:46+0000;1481479726;2016-12-11 19:08:46;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Not only does the introduction of Christmas items cause  Free From  items to be moved all over the store and not under  Free From  signage but it also means that you have reduced your already limited range of dairy and soya free items in store.   Having a toddler with a dairy (and possibly soya) allergy is hard enough but when stores stop stocking products it makes it almost impossible. Tesco are by far the most superior supermarket when it comes to  Free From  products but at the moment you are on a par with  if not worse than the other supermarkets. The  Free From  range this week was pretty much non existent  you had no yoghurts  spread and very limited amounts of milk which were both dairy and soya free. To make matters worse a Tesco colleague tried to give me lactose free milk telling me it was the same as dairy free. I have no problem with staff members not knowing which products do or don t contain dairy or soya but when they clearly do not know about dietary needs then they certainly shouldn t be giving out false information and making it up.   There is definitely a gap in the market for dairy and soya free products in general but more specifically those which are targeted at children  it s as if only adults have these allergies. For example my two year old doesn t eat the same amount of yoghurt as an adult in one sitting and putting half a tub into a Tupperware and into the fridge for the next day doesn t work either as the yoghurt separates and goes all funny. And if you have a diary allergy you have to have a very plain palette as the only flavour you can have in anything is coconut. Surely it can t be hard to make a strawberry flavoured milk and soya free yoghurt?   If you could let me know when you plan to reintroduce these products back into store and if you intend to extend the range at any time I would appreciate that.   Thank you;;;;;2016-12-11T17:26:35+0000;1481477195;2016-12-11 18:26:35;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I purchased a high value  Christmas present on 25th Nov - was due to be delivered within 3-5days  no sign. After emailing customer services apparently the delivery driver could not find the address/there was no one there to receive the item - there had been someone at the property on every single one of his  attempted  deliveries.  It was then advised that he had left a card at the address he was attempting to deliver at which was clearly incorrect  according to Tesco we needed to retrieve this card... how/why??? I provided a correct address  why is it my responsibility to figure out where the delivery driving is attempting to deliver to?!  Anyway we did  the property we believed they were attempting to deliver to was vacant so no way we could retrieve the card but a note was left saying call this no. if you are attempting to deliver said item for Tesco.  It was then advised by Tesco we would be contacted directly by the courier - this didn t happen.  After lots of back & fourth we were advised firstly that Tesco could not get a response from there courier - my options were... wait & see if it gets delivered before Christmas  or get a refund as the item was sold out & they couldn t guarantee it would be back in stock before Christmas.   Obviously I was not happy with this  found the item elsewhere at a much higher value & requested from Tesco they reimburse the difference - not possible  this is against company policy  obviously!  In the meantime I was advised by one of Tesco s customer service advisors on twitter that my item had infact been lost by Yodel  whilst on the same day a different customer service advisor advised me via email that they would attempt to redeliver next week...  if this is not the height of embarrassment for such a big  trusted brand as Tesco I don t know what is.  I really cannot believe the service I ve received!  & I still have to wait 3-5 days for my refund of ¬£400 to be processed - money which they have had for 15days without me receiving my item!  I m hoping by putting this post of facebook I will receive a more appropriate response than I have thus far!  üò°;;;;;2016-12-10T19:23:41+0000;1481397821;2016-12-10 20:23:41;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I told them I needed it by today which is why I ordered it woth you  as I am due to have a c-section for my twins on Monday morning and today is the only day I can collect it. The guy at the store I was suppose to collect it at was obviously trying to wind me up knowing I was angry about the situation you guys left me in. He had me repeat my order number literally 20 times pretending that he can t hear me   before telling me he can t find it and then without saying another word he put phone down on desk and talked amongst colleagues and customers. I ended up phoning direct and cancelling my order completely. Never again will I order from you if you cant do something as simple as send it to the correct store.;;;;;2016-12-10T17:44:05+0000;1481391845;2016-12-10 18:44:05;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

And was told actually they hadnt been able to send me one as it was out of stock!! So ive now waited in for 2 days for a parcel they knew wasnt going to come but didnt bother to let me know now i have to wait 5 days for a refund before i can TRY and buy my son a Go Kart im time for christmas!

When I complained in store  the employee first said the Sheba boxes aren t in the ¬£10 offer  they re 2 for ¬£7. But I checked the pet aisle and there was a 3 for 10 offer on selected Shebas listed.

What a joke that turned out to be! Time passes well after 7 days calls tesco to be told we have to call a company sports hq! fine called them said it was delivered?! lies!! They read out our address house number 1/1 when my fiance tried to explain to the person on the call that there is no house number 1/1 that is our flat number and gave them the correct house number no one could understand what my fiance was going on about!! They put him on hold for god knows how long only to be hung up on! When he called back another person didnt understand what we were trying to explain! Its not that hard!! After about an hour and half on the phone we were told to call sports hq. Got a girl on the phone who said it was sent back to the warehouse but they have to wait till its signed as back before they can re send it to the correct address. Fine waited passed another week still nothing! Called sports hq back was advised it still hasn t been signed back and theres nothing they could do! At this point i asked for a refund I was then put on hold when the girl came back she said she could send one out just now and we would get it in 2 days! So how is this possible if it wasn t back in the warehouse yet??! We decided to go ahead with the refund was told 3-5 working days that had passed still nothing! We then got a text from Tesco this week asking to call them to give card details called them said they don t give the refund sports hq do? SERIOUSLY eventually after having to repeat the card number 5 TIMES then being passed to another department to also repeat the card number it was resolved expected 3-5 working days this isn t good enough Tesco I will never shop with you again if this is how you treat your customers unbelievable!!;;;;;2016-12-10T15:45:47+0000;1481384747;2016-12-10 16:45:47;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My 11 year old son was with his nan with the intent to buy his younger brother a present for Xmas. Nan had gone to the toilet and my son and found a box of lego he liked to buy his brother and went to wait for his nan to return from the toilet at the front of the store with the box to show her what he had found. It was here he was approached and stopped by the duty manager who then accused my son of stealing!!! His reason for doing so was my son had passed all points for method of payment yet hadn t actually left the premises! How can an 11 year old child that is making no attempt to run no attempt to conceal or hide the product and no attempt to leave the premises be accused of theft? If the product hasn t left the store surely it can t be classed as stolen!! When my wife went to the store to complain she was told by the duty manager that he was  preventing an incident !!! No you ve had made a very bad judgement!! My son is devastated that he has been accused of being a thief and very upset by the whole incident. Tesco you really do need to educate your staff a little bit better with the law as if the police would have been called they would have simply agreed with us that the product hadn t left the store so no crime has been committed.

On another note I wanted to say how I didn t appreciate being spoken to like a 5 year old by Maldon tesco direct staff and that if they are in a customer service role they may wish to  re  evaluate how they talk to people.

I do this because I have to order large amounts of Dairy Free milk for my daughter to tide us over and thus save me numerous trips to the Supermarket (where I inevitably spend more!) . I very clearly have added notes in the  notes  section to not offer Dairy  Soya or Coconut alternatives if my milk is unavailable  (leaving Almond  Hazlenut or Hemp). Imagine my annoyance today when my husband has gone to collect to find 6 of the milks replaced with Soya ones? He was given a refund but we need the milk not the refund. (He didn t deal with it particularly well by just accepting this but that s a separate issue!). It s very inconvenient and renders the notes section pointless if our requests aren t going to be acknowledged.;;;;;2016-12-10T11:53:26+0000;1481370806;2016-12-10 12:53:26;0;4;1;0;5;4;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

First time was some finding dory plastic mugs the ticket said ¬£2.50 however got to the till scanned through at ¬£5 each. So instead of honouring the ticket price (which is what is meant to happen) they just took them off my bill and put to one side. Second time I went in there was tinsel in a box with a massive ¬£1 sign on each side of said red box  I thought till I ll have some of that. Again got to the till scanned in at ¬£3 (I was not paying ¬£3) so again instead of honouring the price the staff member took it off my bill and removed all the tinsel out of that box. To say I m embarrassed is an understatement. For example of how it should be done  went into sainsburys and brought some yogurts the ticket said ¬£1.50 (sale price) came through the till at ¬£2 spoke to the cashier and the supervisor went and checked (like I would expect) came back and reduced the price to what the ticket said.

I d like to say it was quick   easy and convenient however it was anything but. Because the shopping is brought over from the Bognor Regis store there is no proper area for collection   just a signpost in the car park where the van pulls up. There are no proper facilities which means it s dark. Very dark. There are no lights and the car park lighting is useless as it is too far away.   Luckily it wasn t raining as there is no cover either. The driver does his best with a pocket torch but you cannot see in the crates   cannot see your shopping to check it and cannot see inside the car to pack it.  It s dangerous   lazy and totally unacceptable from a brand like Tesco. Please do something about it as soon as possible.;;;;;2016-12-09T19:56:54+0000;1481313414;2016-12-09 20:56:54;6;2;6;0;8;2;2;0;1;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;0

You say I was unable to supply photographic I.D. and / or my payment card.  I have supplied both !!  On 3 separate occasions today.  The problem was  I was asked to put my card in the card reader and punch in the pin number( this doesn t work because the card is old and worn and it suits me because I never use it at ATM s etc.)  When I received confirmation of the transaction( see below ) it clearly states that I need to bring the card used in the transaction.................Nowhere does it mention pin numbers etc.  Collecting your order  The person whose credit/debit card was used to pay for the order must be the person who collects the order and they must bring the following:  Order confirmation number  A valid photo ID (UK Photographic Driving Licence  Passport or EU ID card)  The credit/debit card used to pay for this order Pick up date: Pick up point location: After 2pm on 09/12/2016 Ilkeston - Tesco - Extra  Rutland street  DE7 8DG  I have contacted my bank  HSBC who have confirmed that Tesco have had my money since yesterday.  As Tesco are unwilling to carry out the agreed transaction that I have already paid for and are unwilling to give me my money back now ( only after 10 days !!!) we are unable to afford to go on holiday now.  I have just rang our friends to explain that we will not be picking them up later as agreed ( to go on holiday ) so they will have to book a taxi or some alternative.  So ! because of Tesco we have lost our money  our holiday and some good friends.  HSBC are to contact their fraud squad as they can see that a transaction has been attempted during my third visit to Tescos today  Would you say Tesco are committing fraud ??  Or just downright criminal ??  Your thoughts ?  Richard Fleckney;;;;;2016-12-09T17:54:23+0000;1481306063;2016-12-09 18:54:23;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I bought a petrol lawnmower from you earlier in the year and it stopped working. After having the run around for 30 minutes trying to find the department responsible you eventually told me I had to ring the manufacturer  MTD. Fair enough  even though my warranty is with you  this might be the easiest route to take. I rang them and they said I had to take it to my local agent  which I did  and now I have still not heard back from them for two weeks   despite leaving an ansafone message every day. I know it is not your fault that the engineers are behaving in this unprofessional  way but my warranty is with you  not them  and I would like to be treated better.  If I wanted to be treated shabbily I  would have bought from a shabby company  but I love Tesco customer service so I bought from Tesco.  Please send me a new mower or return my money;;;;;2016-12-09T11:37:00+0000;1481283420;2016-12-09 12:37:00;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I live in Orkney and on the 29th November  went on a road trip to the big smoke that is Inverness  so I visited Tesco  as you do  and saw a vacuum that was on offer  my mum has been needing a new vacuum so I thought it was perfect. As my car was already quite full I went to one of your fancy machines and ordered the vacuum to be delivered to Kirkwall store when I got home.  On 3rd December I got a text to say it arrived. I was delighted. So today I set off to Kirkwall to collect the vacuum only to be told once I got there that it wasn t in store. I advised that I got a text  showed them my text but no the text was wrong the vacuum was not there I would have to go back another day. When I got home I thought surely nearly a week after I got the text my order must have arrived so I phoned Tesco direct who checked with the store and low and behold it is there!!! So now I need to do another hours round trip to go and collect it. Very very annoying!;;;;;2016-12-08T20:34:53+0000;1481229293;2016-12-08 21:34:53;0;5;2;0;7;5;1;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;1;0

Happy for you to block me too  I ve screen shot this post on your wall and you can answer to alternative authorities if you don t wish to answer us. Many thanks!

Can you please advise the position regarding why Tesco Harford Norwich petrol station keeps closing in the evening. My wife has been twice on a Thursday night between 9 and 10pm to find the entrance coned over and last Thursday was forced to pay a 9ppl premium at our local garage instead due to the closure. I thought perhaps you were awaiting a delivery. However I had the same thing at 10.20 pm last night  entrance coned over but noted there was no employee in the kiosk so you must be closed even though it s supposed to be 24 hr pay at pump there was no access to the pumps. I have travelled to work this morning with my fuel light on so I haven t had to pay 9ppl more too.;;;;;2016-12-08T07:21:25+0000;1481181685;2016-12-08 08:21:25;1;3;1;0;4;3;2;1;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

The customer service is absolutely disgusting you are forced to wait hours arguing on the phone only for the things you have agreed to never happen and constantly being let down while they hold onto your money.    I order 2 bikes for the children  they loose not one but both of them  do they call you to tell you  no they wait till nearly a week later when you chase where they are to tell you.  One of the bikes is now out of stock and there are no  suitable  alternatives.  You eventually agree (after a lot of complaining) they will keep your money and email you when it is back in stock.  Do they no  when I checked on Friday it was in stock  I wait till Sunday for an email which doesn t come so I called only to find out it is out of stock again.  So I complain again  I am advised they will give me a ¬£10 good will gesture - I am not interested in money I want my bike which was heavily discounted due to the pre Black Friday sales  if I simply got a refund I am NOW not going to get anywhere as cheap.  He asks what he can do I advise you can get me a suitable alternative at which point he tries to push several boys bikes as a replacement for the GIRLS bike I have purchased.  The only alternative is ¬£50 more which he can t match so I advise if you can t get me a bike then get someone who can.  He agrees as every manager is far too busy to speak to a customer that has already had to complain twice they will call me back.  Nearly 5 hours later I get a call back by which point I am more than a little angry. After much discussion she agrees to match the more expensive bike due to the extremely poor service but as it is sold by a partner I have to pay initially and then get a refund which I agree to  this should be processed in three days.  By Wednesday I have received no refund so I call back to explain I have an email agreeing to refund the price match but no refund for the original bike which I have now paid twice for.  I explain this 6 times to an operator who clearly is not listening to me and sounds like he had just woken up before being put on hold three times to  check this  he eventually agrees to return the original cost of the bike.  I ask for confirmation that the ¬£50 has already been processed at which point he gets completely confused with what I am talking  about  here is where I admit I completely loose it - I have spent half an hour on the phone explaining and repeating a story which should be clear from the notes what has happened and agreed  and he hasn t listened to a word.  He then puts me on hold again to come back and tell me they don t price match so they would never have agreed to do this.  I am clearly banging my head against a brick wall with this one so ask for another manager at which point he asks  can I ask why  REALLY.  Once again they are all to busy to speak to me but I make it quite clear there is no way I am getting off the phone with out speaking to some one they eventually come on the phone to tell me they need to wait to speak to the person who it was agreed with - sorry it is not my problem that your staff are incapable of making notes to explain what has happened and I am not waiting another day for this to be sorted.  It finally appears to have been but only after me chasing  pushing and complaining wasting my time and effort on something so simple.  I am now out of pocket more money than what both bikes cost me in the first place and have to wait another 3-5 days to get my money back.  What a joke  this is not the first time you have disappointed on orders last year I was told 2 days before my daughters birthday you had lost one of her presents and it was out of stock.

Since you re asking  I m just about DEMENTED - with YOU! Let me explain.   For at least the past 5 years I have religiously shopped in my local Tesco store. Let s say I spend  on average  ¬£120 a week  that s a total of ¬£41 650...(OMG  I had no idea it would be that much..)  Being such a loyal customer  I make use of your clubcard scheme. I have been saving my vouchers up all year  eagerly anticipating spending them on Christmas. So  suitably prepared  I did some online shopping to help Santa out. Everything went well  I placed my order  shut the lid on the laptop  poured a nice glass of wine (purchased from Tesco) and sat back to relax knowing that Christmas was all wrapped up....Well  almost.  I received an email a couple of days later explaining that You were very sorry  but part of the order I placed and You accepted could not be delivered  I m assuming due to stock issues. Not to worry  I thought  I ll get that one other item elsewhere and You can refund my vouchers.  A couple of days later  I open the faithful laptop to order yet another item from Tesco  at the checkout  I was dismayed to find that I couldn t pay with my remaining Clubcard Vouchers  because You hadn t replaced them. I phoned your helpline and spoke with a very helpful lady who explained that the points would be added onto my statement in February....February!!?? That s no good  I need them now  I ve spent ¬£41 650 in your store and funds are running a wee bitty low. The lady on the phone was very helpful  she said she would send me a Money Card number along with a pin and I could purchase my wares online again.  So  myself and the trusty laptop begun our mission to order a lovely Tesco Christmas dinner. We loaded the cart  picked a delivery slot  added the carrier bags....Guess what happened when we got to the checkout? That s right..! We couldn t pay with the gift/money card.  Now  call me old fashioned  but since Tesco made the error in the original online purchase  surely  considering my previous loyal payments of ¬£41 650 (I still can t believe that number...)  you should be helping me out.....please..  So Tesco  I m going to sit down now with another lovely glass of your relaxing wine and wait for you to get back to me on how best we can sort this out - time is running short to make sure I have all the Extra Special ingredients to WOW my family and friends on the big day.   Remember Tesco  Every Little Helps...Ho  Ho  Ho  Merry Christmas...!;;;;;2016-12-07T20:47:20+0000;1481143640;2016-12-07 21:47:20;9;3;10;1;14;3;3;0;1;0;9;0;0;1;0;0;0

I did a big she to use my Tesco Vouchers up. The girl at the till could use her right arm so it was very slow & she kept asking the lady on the next till out. I got all the shopping put away. Gave my Tesco card & vouchers.  She was having trouble getting them to scan with just the one arm & hand .I did try to hold them down while she scan it. It was only when I got home I realised only ¬£37.50 had been used instead of ¬£42.50. Can you do anything please as I have had my last pay day till the 10th January. Thanks. Not blaming the girl at all. She was doing her best.;;;;;2016-12-07T19:47:27+0000;1481140047;2016-12-07 20:47:27;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Your soy milk was 75p  at least during this entire year. I ve always liked it because it tasted better than other soy milks. Then  all of a sudden  the price has been increased to 85p  even 89p in Tescos Express. I found it unfair  but kept buying it. I ve just been to my local Tesco and seen that the same soy milk that yesterday was 89p is now 95p!!!! Are you crazy? Do you really think that people will keep buying a product that is not even organic when places like Aldi the same product for way less? Not to mention that the taste was different lately. I could understand an increase during the entire year  but two significant increases in not even two months is definitely too much.

The driver was friendly and very helpful. The food was excellent. All with instructions for heating and meats and salads nicely packed and presented.  It certainly made life easy and we were able to choose something for everyone of the ten of us  including teens and toddlers. Would not hesitate to recommend it and use it again.

In this day and age I feel as a society we are so quick to complain and do not congratulate or thank good service. I just wanted to say thank you for the great customer service I have just received. Yesterday morning at 8.15 I rang customer service as I had an issue with a pair of school shoes. This issue was resolved instantly with a refund being issue. Later that day around 4.15 I ordered a new pair online  I have the delivery saver pass so chose to have them delivered today. This morning at 8.20 I had a knock at my door.....school shoes delivered. So in 24 hours I had my issue resolved  new shoes ordered and delivered! Amazing service from tesco  so thank you!

I order my shopping online  pay with this card and then before my shopping is delivered I get a call asking for the security number. Apparently this is a software fault. It s time someone got cracking to sort it out. My shopping money is paid into my clubcard account each month but I can easily cancel that and go with Sainsbury offering me 58% off of my shopping or Waitrose  a similar discount. This appears not to affect ALL clubcard customers but certainly a lot more than just me. It d be interesting to know how many? I ve spoken to Tesco bank and they ve confirmed my card is alright. So  what is going on. Come on Tesco s get this sorted!;;;;;2016-12-07T10:46:49+0000;1481107609;2016-12-07 11:46:49;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

With 7 children and me working the night-shift it s a logistical nightmare for us to go to the store. It s for this reason that we us the Tesco Grocery iPhone app.  It turns out that our Tesco app reverted to our obsolete card details and as such our payment was declined.  Instead of passing it off and refusing to deliver  our regular delivery driver Graham (Tesco Extra Bletchley) spotted our address and came early with the online customer service rep on the phone so that we could process the payment again and not miss our delivery.

They close at midnight and I got there at 11:40. I get there and they have turned the door off so I stand there and a security guard comes to the door and opens it.   Me: Don t you guys close at midnight?  Security guard: Yeah its midnight now.  Me: No it isn t! It s not midnight for another 20 minutes.  Security guard:(waves his hand and me in a dismissive manner) and says  yea yea yea.  This is the second time I have gone to this location and encountered RUDE staff and the second time I have found them locking up early. I complained about this before and they called the store manager...who denied that they had closed early.  Do you want customers  money or not? It seems to me that this particular store has no interest whatsoever in making any money. All they care about is going home at 12 on the dot. You need new staff.;;;;;2016-12-06T23:51:07+0000;1481068267;2016-12-07 00:51:07;1;3;1;0;4;3;2;1;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

From a loyal customer who shops with you on a regular basis and who has always recommend you as the best place to do online groceries  I have to say I am appalled with you today!!  So order was due tonight as usual... last week the gentleman who was delivering was such a lovely man may I add. Well tonight I am waiting up.. as we had received a text message to advise us that our delivery was delayed... ok no problem  my daughters on a school trip tomorrow so have to sort her packed lunch after delivery... but again not a problem.. after waiting till 10.55  we decided to contact you.   So apparently there was a problem with payment? No Tesco  card is correct  funds are there.... next problem.. they tried to contact you... no Tesco one missed call on the stated number all day and that was from a mobile number... not you! So you emailed which I only saw as you stated about it... so now I have waiting around all evening for you to deliver groceries which are needed to make a packed lunch for my daughters trip... and what do I have.. nothing! NO you did not call and I d probably say this was a mistake from your end  and I have been fobbed off with an excuse. If there was a genuine problem  and contact HAD been made  the problem would have been resolved. To top it off the man who answered the call was like some robot reading off a script! So after Christmas it will be time to look for somebody else to use!;;;;;2016-12-06T23:46:06+0000;1481067966;2016-12-07 00:46:06;0;18;0;0;18;18;6;12;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I sat down this morning with my usual bowl of Nestl√© Cheerios  and much to my amazement and displeasure  I could not spell my name! No amount of Frankenstein-like butchering to the circular multigrain pieces could even recreate anything close to how my name is written. So therefore I had to spend my day feeling miserable  knowing that my name could never ever be made out of cereal. I also contemplated using different types of cereal  like Rice Krispies  Corn Flakes and Nesquik. But then I came to the realisation that these cereals aren t even in the shape of letters!  Please can you recommend an appropriate cereal which could fulfil the desire to spell my name out in breakfast cereal for all to see. I can then begin to pass this story down from generation to generation for years to come.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Yours sincerely;;;;;2016-12-06T22:43:43+0000;1481064223;2016-12-06 23:43:43;24;0;41;0;41;0;0;0;0;0;24;2;1;14;0;0;0

I found a Cadbury cake in the reduced fridge section. No yellow sticker! Dam somebody must have discarded it but wait a minute  its got todays date.

Oh yeah  i put it in the fridge but can t mark it down until 7pm  What? Everything else has a yellow sticker on but this cannot have a sticker until 7pm? Tesco  do you have some sort of special rules for cake? I left it with them as i certainly wasnt paying full price (although i had no idea what that was) for a cake going off. Nor was i going to loiter for 30 mimutes to reach 7pm for a yellow sticker (didnt look that nice). Would you be so kind as to explain why I was told this?

I couldn t believe it when they told me they could not summon a manager becuase someone had taken their phone!  They told me to go back upstairs to the payment desk and push in to ask for the manager!  I eventually got the manager and he put me on to a member of staff  who then confirmed that they didn t have any vests. When I asked why I was told they were very short of staff.

I  have always been a huge huge consumer of this ( I go through around 4-6 pints a day) and always favoured this over Nesquik which I found to be a bit overly sweet.  There is something odd about the way it behaves now when first spooned in to the milk  then when stirred it feels like the milk is thick and gloopy but it isnt but all this pales in to insignificance compared to whatever it is you have done to the taste!  Your mix used to taste creamy with just the right non over powering genuine flavour of banana  but now it tastes a bit gritty and the banana flavouring is now just horribly synthetic and leaves a nasty after taste.  Why did you fiddle about with it?  If its not broke dont fix it!  I am afraid I will now be going back to Nesquik as  as much as I have tried  I just do not like your  new improved  version.

As I clicked and collected on Sunday (4th) to find today that the  free from  CHILDRENS YOGHURTS you had given me went out of date on Friday (2nd) the packaging on the outside doesn t have the date on and only one yoghurt on the inside has the date which is hard to see as it is black writing in a dark purple lid.   I fed these to my 6 month old lactose free baby without even checking the date as I wasn t expecting to be delivered out of date food. I am disgusted and feel sick that my tiny newly weaned baby has been fed out of date food.   My child already suffers with stomach problems and this could have made him so much worse!   I suggest you check the shelves in your Shoreham store as the yogurts will need to be removed from the cardboard packaging to see if they are out of date. This isn t the first time I have been in the store and seen out of date food on the shelf 2 weeks ago your fruit pots were all out of date!

Yesterday (Monday 5th December) I needed to get some fuel. 99%  of the time I go to Morrison for my fuel except on the rare occasion I run too low and attend the first fuel station available. Yesterday appeared to be that day and even with a vallaint effort to get to Morrison I found myself having to stop sooner at Tesco s  it wasn t a big issue or so I thought! It was busy  all the pumps were full and small queue s at each pump  in for a penny in for a pound join a queue any queue watching all the other vehicles around me I joined a queue. I got to the pump and there was a red sticker saying something about remote assistance for disabled drivers  there was no information on how to use or access the service and couldn t find any speakers or buttons and the queue is building up behind me so I positioned my car far enough out to have the additional space to get my chair out. Got out the car  used the car for balance and got the chair out the rear or the car  got seated and positioned  pick up the nosle and put it into my car. The screen says pay at the pump only. So I had to put the nosle back put my chair back into the car get myself back into the car  by this point the car in front is moving off  brilliant that will do nicely  pulled forward ready to get back out looked at the screen  pay at the pump only. I then had to drive all the out of the petrol station round the roundabout and back in rejoining the evergrowing queue which now also involved a police car 6 civilian cars and a hgv that couldn t decide where to go. Eventually after 5 mins I got myself into another queue at another pump. Here we go again.  pulled up with still no instructions on how to access disabled help  I got out the car leaving enough space to get my chair out  struggled to the rear of the car got my chair out and started to fill up. Once done I entered the shop to pay by cash. I was the only one in the shop as the last customer left as I was approaching. failing to find any push button pads to automatically open the door for me i struggled with the door until customer leaving came to help. once inside the shop there was 3 cashiers in the shop one serving the lady who helped me with the door one in the office with the door open so i could see her and one sitting watching me struggle. Brilliant isnt it. I waited for about 40-50secs to be called and served while the two counter cashiers finished thier chit chat about that nights dinner plans. The cashier didnt even call me she just stood there looking at me at which point i looked at her and her colleague and asked if they had finished sorting thier dinner arrangements. There was no response so i went over and ask why the pay at the pump only pumps were not marked as such or were they temporarily not accepting cash if not why is there no sign noticable to the customers. After about a 2-3 min discussion on which pumps they were the cashier in the office got up and joined the conversation  by which point other customers were coming in to pay. The other cashier at the till had no interest in serving the customers waiting she stood and listened into the conversation i was having with my cashier and office lady. The queueing customers were starting to get a bit restless at not being served. once we assertained which pumps i was referring to she oh there are signs up and should be on all four of those pumps as they are all pay at the pump only. then office lady says oh the two rear ones are sign posted GET THIS! JUST UNDER THE ROOF  because thats exactly where all motorists look for a sign when they are watching traffic and other vehicles straight ahead of them. and those signs only cover the two rear pumps not the front two but i am supposed to know that the signs out of my line of vision under the roof are for all four pumps. I explained to the cashier that the signs need to be more prominant and explain which pumps they refer to. Not a single word out the cashier  she took my money  and gave me a receipt. No thank you  no apology  no explanation nothing  not even a single word to say we offer disabled assistance and this is how you could access the service. that would have been my next question had she not have been so ignorant. by which point i just gave up and didnt even bother. resulting to the fact i would rather pay through the nose at texaco than use Tesco s again. Once i paid and went to leave the shop that was another challenge in itself. Granted its not a big shop. Its wide enough for shelves against the wall with a single que of people then a center isle of shelves with another que of people then shelving against the other wall. When people come into the shop they dont form queue s either side of the center shelving its not big enough and people wont get out out. so you come in form a single queue approach the counter pay and leave by the other side of the shelving. It keeps things flowing as its not possible to try and get back through the queue of people to get out. Bloody brilliant idea in principle. paid for my fuel managed to turn around to try and get out. on the left against the wall is a massive hot drinks station which wouldnt have posed a problem had the staff not stuck 4 large  heavy boxes on the floor right opposite the drinks station that sticks out a little too far. i tried to shift them out the way to the side so i had enough space to get my chair through  but i got stuck  so when i eventually got myself free and turned around the cashier that served me is standing watching me  not at any point did she offer to come and help or shift the boxes over a bit  and office lady was back in her office but still she didnt shout someone to assist me like office lady if the cashier was still serving. The whole shop of queing people then had to move to the side and out of the way so i could get through with my chair  all because someone thought they would stack some boxes right opposite an object that protruded into the ailse thus shortening the space for me to get my chair through. well done  very well thought out. Brilliant idea  it was wide enough for an able bodied person to walk past so thats ok  that will be fine no problem leaving boxes stacked up narrowing the gap as long as someone can walk past it. well done ü§£üëçüëåüëè.As most of the customers had to move to let me back out the way i came in some waited outside the shop or by the door so the door was already open and at least i didnt have to struggle with it on they way out. Excellent service  top class. truly a customer focused company! And that ladies and gentleman since my ex husband transfered out of that tesco store and back to scotland in 09 is why i never use tesco s.;;;;;2016-12-06T16:07:30+0000;1481040450;2016-12-06 17:07:30;0;10;0;0;10;10;5;5;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Purchased on 1st November it arrived a few days later. When i tried to use it  it showed that no money had been loaded and it hadn t been activated even though it was bought from tesco and paid for online. Around 8 -10 phone calls over the following month led to nothing. Firstly promised it would be looked into. Then promised it would be manually loaded. Then when that didn t happen  a new card would be sent out. that was weeks ago. When i called this week the paperwork was still sitting on someones desk. three more calls until i finally spoke to a lovely woman who hopefully has sorted it. Going down to the office herself i am now today told it has been posted. No real official apology only one from the poor woman on the helpline. No acknowledgement of the stress and the fact that a month has passed. or the cost of the amount of telephone calls i had to make to repeat the same thing over and over again. I m told its now in the post. That remains to be seen. I doubt it very much.;;;;;2016-12-06T13:34:44+0000;1481031284;2016-12-06 14:34:44;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

There are so many products close to or on the day of the use by date and I find that on most of my weekly shops  I pick up something that is out of date. I expect to be able to buy a resonable amount of food that will last until later in the week. I now find that I have to spend a good chunk of my time in your store checking dates and swapping items.  Today I wasn t as thorough as I thought as whilst i was putting my items away I noticed the date on some sausages were yesterday s date. Is just not good enough. I haven t got time to return them and why should I waste even more of my day doing so?  I m a regular shopper at tesco and I would typically spend between ¬£60-¬£100 in your stores weekly. I m seriously considering spending that money somewhere else.  Happy to send a photo of the product and the receipt but reluctant to put my receipt photo on here.

But now you ve taken it one step too far and made Tesco own brand milkshake powders sugar free!! And what s with getting rid of the chocolate flavour?? Not everyone likes strawberry and banana! And even with many customers complaining you still go on to make these changes!   Many people are allergic to the ingredients in sugar free alternatives and it tastes vulgar so why should you take that right away from people? It s not about making healthy choices because you ve just taken that from everyone who shops with you guys. However I m sure you know all of this!   Also not everyone can get to other stores to get alternate products that aren t sugar free so online shopping is the only way  again another right taken away from people. Suppose we could just change our online shop to Asda who sell a wider variety of products with sugar!   I m sure you are losing customers!

However  the duty mangaer type person was quick into action. Directing staff and customers. The main tills were still a bit unsure on what to do with themselves  but the self serve ones seemed to have bounced back. The manager said I d have to scan my shopping again. As an apology for the inconvenience I could have my tin of roses  humongous bag of pasta and the screen wash (which is all I  actually went in for!) for free. A staff member did all the scanning and packing and continuously apologised. Which was lovely considering it was a power cut and not exactly Tescos fault.

Then after arrangements had been made  Tesco changed their mind a few hours later.  - Offered a refund but was told TV would not be replaced. No offer of a repair (even though it s a brand new TV). Would not say why at first  then told it was out of stock. Consumer rights act 2015  states if a product is not fit for purpose then a replacement or repair  at the expense of the company who sold the product  must be offered.   - A few hours later  after further trying to resolve the problem with Tesco  they told me Tesco had discontinued selling the TV product (05/12/16).  - TV was still available to buy (now at an increased price at which I paid  ¬£399) on the Tesco website. (After being told it was discontinued). Even though I was told it was out of stock (05/12/16) and then told it was discontinued  I was able to place an order for the exact same model TV as a new customer with no problems. Videos/screenshots taken as proof with times and date. (Had previously asked  after being told it was out of stock  for a change to be made to website to show it was out of stock)  over 5 hours later  no change had been made.  - Furniture ombudsman contacted after trying to resolve the matter with Tesco failed.  - Trading standards to be notified  along with a letter and message to Tescos  CEO  containing the full transcript of conversation.  Extremely disappointed with Tesco that we could not come to an agreement and that this matter had to be taken further. Will provide constant daily feedback updates via Facebook and twitter social media to help any other people in a similar situation.;;;;;2016-12-05T18:14:59+0000;1480961699;2016-12-05 19:14:59;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I bought some freshwater prawns from Tesco in Ellesmere at the end of last week. Very tasty with a home-made Marie Rose sauce and some Little Gem lettuce.  There were a few left over which went in our food waste bin  which is outside the back door which is in darkness at this time of day.  To my amazement  minutes later  the prawns are glowing brightly at the bottom of the bin.  Are they radioactive in what??????;;;;;2016-12-05T17:35:50+0000;1480959350;2016-12-05 18:35:50;0;4;0;0;4;4;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We bought a bike for our son s Christmas present in September. We got the bike and put it in the loft  upon attempting to set it up last night we discovered the chain guard and the stabilisers are shattered. The bike is now out of stock on your website and your only options are that you collect the bike  we pay for a new one and then we get the refund within 5 working days. I don t have the money to pay for a present I have already bought  it s the second week of December. Or that we wait for the refund but you can t guarantee that the bike is in stock. All we asked for is that you send a replacement as you pick up the broken bike  and that we get the refund for the difference.I am tears  I worked very hard to buy my son a present to find it broken  and then find you no help at all. This is not the first issue we ve had with broken Tesco direct items and we have always been patient. I ve cancelled our weekly shop with you  and I m afraid if we don t get a satisfactory response we ll take all of our custom elsewhere- as a 4 year old boy who wrote to Father Christmas asking for a monster bike currently isn t getting one  and you really don t seem to care.;;;;;2016-12-05T17:08:17+0000;1480957697;2016-12-05 18:08:17;3;27;10;7;44;26;20;6;25;0;3;0;0;0;0;6;0

Ordered click and collect this morning (would have been delivery had there been ANY available slots) go to pick my shopping up in the earliest slot 4pm-6pm and find that there are substitutes.... ok so some substitutes to be expected  Rubens apples to Braeburn apples  yellow pepper to orange pepper and velvet toilet roll to Tesco own. Apples fine. Peppers fine but toilet roll quality is absolutely not the same.  Further down we have 12 bottles of water. Just water. Nothing special about it. Just plain old water.  No appropriate substitute available.  So now this evening after my children have been to school I have to drag a new born  a stroppy 12 year old and a 7 year old boy who does not cope well with supermarkets around to go and buy 12 bottles of water and apples for the lunch boxes tomorrow and yellow pepper for tea as well as toilet roll which as you know is kind of a necessity.   This defeats the point of online shopping. If I wanted to go into a supermarket I would have done so in the first place. I declined all substitutions being as the most important thing I needed was the water and no substitutions were made because apparently Tesco only sell one type of water.  Made a complaint to find a solution to the problem and have been told there is no solution.  Great service Tesco  first and last time I ll be shopping with yourselves. If you wanted to keep customers and give great service I d have a 12 pack of water on my door step before the day was out.;;;;;2016-12-05T17:03:40+0000;1480957420;2016-12-05 18:03:40;2;6;2;0;8;6;5;1;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have been in contact with your support team recently regarding my daughters hudl that we bought as a Christmas present back in 2013.. we had lots of issues with it  and 2015 it was sent away and a new HUDL was given to us (after a choice of refund or exchange). We went on this option based on the fact Santa had given it to her and she was very upset she could no longer use the item!! After a little wait we had the HUDL back but again pretty useless- it will not charge or even turn on for her anymore...  I ve been going through the process of contacting Tesco support regarding this  when being told they would call me back it hasn t happened and leaves me having to call you again. Today it has been said after finally finding my proof of purchase that I will not be given any kind of refund or exchange as it was so long ago  despite the two facts that we had opted to have an exchange previously and the fact it s happened all over again! As a loyal customer of Tesco I m very disheartened that nothing more has been done to help us in regard to this. Tesco tiverton tech team had told me as there was so many problems with the Hudls they were discontinued and I would get a refund or exchange as the item is deemed unsafe!;;;;;2016-12-05T16:58:12+0000;1480957092;2016-12-05 17:58:12;1;8;1;0;9;8;3;5;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

This was apparently due to a system error of Wellingborough store being unable to upload everyone s orders for picking. These things happen but I am furious that no one bothered to have the common courtesy to telephone or even text me to explain the situation. I now have to wait until tomorrow afternoon for a new delivery. I have 5 children and I do not drive so anything needed for today and tomorrow has now had to be purchased in our local grocery store which is considerably dearer than Tesco. There is also no consistency over goodwill gestures. I was offered a ¬£10 ecoupon then discovered my friend  who s order was due the same time  got that plus another ¬£4 for the missed delivery slot.

Each time I have had to contact them a week or two later to ask them what happened to my refund. It s a waste of my time and I resent the fact that Tesco keeps customers  money until they ask for it. I am meticulous about recording my finances  so I wonder how many tens of thousands of pounds of customers  money Tesco is keeping for people who do not record or check their finances as regularly. By the way  it is the GREENFORD store/warehouse that delivers my groceries. This is in addition to generally poor customer service  including drivers being rude  failing to find my address  even though it is a cul de sac with only 5 houses or simply not turning up at all. I have continued shopping with Tesco simply because I can usually get everything I want there  which is not always the case with other supermarkets  but I m afraid that the poor customer service is losing out to the likes of Morrisons and Ocado who (so far) have provided impeccable customer service. You need to up your game Tesco if you don t want to lose even more customers. It s not enough to rely on customers contacting you to put things right - you need to find out why they are going wrong in the first place and stop them happening. I m sure I m not the only customer who is tired of having to phone you every time I place an order. If I have to phone you again  I‚Äôll be voting with my feet.;;;;;2016-12-05T04:29:42+0000;1480912182;2016-12-05 05:29:42;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

You have moved any reduced items to one area and I really think you need revert this and go back to the previous arrangement of one reduced section in fruit & veg  one in meat etc. Unfortunately you cannot trust some your customers to act responsibly and today we saw two scuffles. One which involved lots of shouting  we were quite far away at the time and the entire store was filled with the noise.   The second incident happened when we were very near the reduced section when we witnessed five adult women push a child out of the way to get the newly put out reduced food. Not only did they shove a child and each other about but when they had retreated to block the aisle opposite and wait for the next lot of reduced items the left food all over the floor.   It s not safe for passers by  or your staff and it results in people blocking other shoppers movements. If you choose to keep it as it is you would need staff to ensure that behaviour does not continue to be honest I don t think you could pay your staff enough to deal with that!;;;;;2016-12-04T20:59:58+0000;1480885198;2016-12-04 21:59:58;6;9;6;1;16;9;3;6;5;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;0

This happened in November and again only yesterday. This time I decided to visit the Roborough branch in Plymouth  and both their toy aisles were adorned end to end with signs advertising the 3 for 2 offer but alas all the Pokemon toys were sold. I spoke to the Customer Services department who were really obliging and tried to hunt out an extra tin for me after showing both my receipts but alas to no avail. For some reason your Lee Mill branch is not advertising this sale at all. After my previous visit to that store back in November I actually stood in that aisle with a member of staff who insisted the toys were no longer on promotion but on my phone I was able to see they were still on 3 for 2 on your Tesco Direct site. So currently I have spent ¬£26 on 2 tins back in November when I could have had a third and again the same yesterday. I am wondering how many other customers are buying toys unaware that there is an offer so they are unwittingly buying two items and not receiving the third free item..... Very disappointed Tesco.......;;;;;2016-12-04T17:34:25+0000;1480872865;2016-12-04 18:34:25;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Anyway today I found out that if you order under ¬£40 of food you not only get charged ¬£4 as a  minimum basket charge   but you also have to pay the delivery charge  so today I paid ¬£9.50 for only buying ¬£30 worth of food.  I think it is disgusting to charge customers TWICE for not spending over ¬£40. It s just part of our wonderful world s way of discriminating against people who are single and live alone - sometimes I don t need ¬£40 worth of food as I don t have a husband or wife or children to feed. So please charge me ¬£9.50 for the privilege. Well I had booked my Christmas slot and already have an extensive shopping list as I will be cooking for my whole family this Christmas - it s a shame sainsburys will get the business and not you because of the appalling way you treat your regular customers.;;;;;2016-12-04T13:01:59+0000;1480856519;2016-12-04 14:01:59;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;7;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Apparently they have no control over deliveries which I find difficult to believe.  I never attempted to book a coveted Christmas Delivery.  If you are a loyal customer paying additional expense for a service because you are disabled and house bound I would have thought some effort could have been made especially when the glitch in their system wiped out multiple reservations I paid for.  Sadly this is the first grocery delivery issue but I have also been inconvenienced a few times recently by their direct delivery which should be covered under this plan.  Disability is a factor for me but more so the unwillingness to help and repeated contact I have had to make myself is time consuming and not what I expect from a store I have been loyal too and paid additional feeds for a service to ease my situation.  Is have asked to speak to someone in more Authority but due to a complete disregard to my request have now had to embarrass myself on social media hoping this receives a response.;;;;;2016-12-04T06:06:02+0000;1480831562;2016-12-04 07:06:02;1;5;2;0;7;5;2;3;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;1;0

Did my shopping and paid for it  but my daughter needed the toilet before we left. I didn t want to leave my shopping or let her go in on her own so I took the trolley in with us to the disabled toilet  as it was very quiet so I wasn t in anyone s way. As we came out there was a quiet couple of beeps  wasn t sure what it was so went to the doors. The security guard put up his hand to stop us and said we set the alarm off in the toilet. He then looked me up and down and just stared until I asked if he wanted to check the shopping. He made us wait until he put the trolley through the gates. As no alarm went off so then he let us go through before giving us the trolley back. No apology afterwards and we had a lot of people staring during this embarrassing experience. Perhaps in future a bit more delicacy in this situation wouldn t go amiss and an apology afterwards for the implication that I was a thief!

Really love your monthly brochure that comes out showing the offers and recipies  however I ve found this month s to be very disappointing :-( Absolutely fell in love with  that s the spirit  promotion in your December edition <3 However that was very short lived :-( As a keen Hendricks fan I noted the offer for the Enchanter Gift Set which includes a 70cl bottle of my favourite tipple at the amazing price of ¬£27! Great! Couldn t wait to get down to my local Tesco with my mum who was keen to spend her money on something I would enjoy as a Christmas gift. Sadly this wasn t to be :-( Not only does my local Tesco admit they haven t had any of these in store on the offer  but they are unaware of whether indeed they might ever receive any at Dunfermline Duloch :-( They cannot order it for me or indeed advise me when it might be available :-( What is the point in running a promotion when you have no intention of supplying the stock that goes with the said offer? :-( Needless to say.. I am very sad at this disaster of a  promotion . Can someone please look into this for me?? I m quite miffed about the whole thing  especially as I ve had my eye on a bottle of this for my Christmas gift for sometime (I ve been price watching between you and Asda for some time now on a weekly basis). Looking forward to hearing something from you soon and hoping it s a little more promising than your promotion. Many thanks Mia McLeod;;;;;2016-12-03T18:42:05+0000;1480790525;2016-12-03 19:42:05;0;4;0;0;4;4;3;1;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I had done my shopping with my 2 year old daughter who is poorly with a cough and I had an order to collect so I waited by the customer service desk to collect it. The lady there was having a conversation with another customer and could clearly see me standing there holding my daughter. I stood there waiting for 10 minutes  the lady (in a red t-shirt I didn t get her name) totally ignored me and began serving the customers at the tabbocco tills. I wondered why she was being so rude  the security person was also there and could see me waiting but no one said anything to me. Finally after almost 15 minutes she asked me if I was waiting for something  I think it was quite clear that I was. She then informed me that I had to wait in the queue for the tobacco counter until I could be served. I asked her why she had left me standing there for so long before she told me this and she ignored me. I was obviously quite cross about the situation and I called her and idiot which I completely understand was wrong of me. How can your customer service team be so unhelpful? I was clearly waiting to see someone and holding my heavy two year old so I really can t understand why no one spoke to me about why I was standing there for so long. Really bad service from this lady and it s a shame as the rest of the team at that store are always very friendly and helpful  what a letdown to your brand and values.;;;;;2016-12-03T17:54:40+0000;1480787680;2016-12-03 18:54:40;0;1;1;1;3;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

You know  the ones you crack. Got home  all ready to get festive and enjoy them in front of the TV (would be an open fire  but we haven t got one) and  to our absolute shock  horror and devastation  we found we didn t have a nut cracker! How could we be so irresponsible? Who buys a bag of nuts without access to a nutcracker?   Anyway  over the next few days  I scour the shelves of every shop I enter. Not one had a nutcracker. Now  we do live in a small town so it s to be expected. We only really have charity shops and hairdressers here. We do  however  have a Sainsburys. They ll have one... Nope! I wasn t too much more disheartened at this point  I was going to our nearest big town on Friday  I would find one there.   Nope! I won t name every shop I tried  but I will say  there are some big names in that list  and not one had a nutcracker.   I was with my Mum  she could sense the devastation in her little (30 year old) girls eyes.  It s ok  she said  I ve got to run into Tesco  they ll have one . She put her arm around my shoulder  and lead the way. (The arm around the shoulder bit may or may not be strictly true)   We walked in to the very shop I d bought the nuts from  your Ashford  Park Farm store. We went down the kitchen accessories aisle. Nothing.  it s ok  she said again   they ll be where the nuts are . Nothing. We headed back to the kitchen aisle for one last look. Definitely not there. She went up to the nearest member of staff she could find. His name was Nick and he came over to have a look with us. A third pair of eyes could not seek out the nutcracker so he had a look on the app on his trusty smart phone. Nothing. Determined there MUST be some somewhere (I mean  you ARE Tesco) he went off in search of one and told us he d come and find us and let us know of his findings. He told us that they are usually on a  clip strip  so we knew what we were looking for.   A few minutes later  he found us. He was very apologetic and told us he couldn t find any. At that point  all of the festiveness in my bones drained away. I was never going to have my nuts.    it s ok   mum said   they have little packs down the nut aisle  they have a nutcracker in them  I ll get you one of them . So  she did  I finally had my nutcracker. Plus  extra nuts  bonus! That was yesterday.   Fast forward to today  I m back in Tesco doing the weekly shop. I m checking out the beef joints on display (half price  great offer!) when I see a jolly man in a Christmas jumper approaching me.    Nutcrackers  he said. It was Nick  the friendly nutcracker hunter from the day before. I smiled.  I found them  he said.  I ve put them on display. By the time I d found them and come to find you yesterday  you d gone .   All at once  the festiveness returned. He had continued his search after telling us he couldn t find any  and even tried to find us when he had. He remembered that and recognised me and stopped the conversation he was having with his colleague to come and tell me.   What an absolute super star!!   I cannot tell you how amazed I was to receive that service. It may seem trivial to some but you don t ever see that sort of service nowadays  especially with the big companies  and on a rammo Saturday in December.   I spent the rest of my shop with a smile on my face and very happy that it seemed important enough to Nick to carry on the search and then tell me the following day.   Could you please pass on my thanks to Nick and also  give him a nice fat Christmas bonus  some Roses (Cadbury  to say thank you very much) and a free day off.   Sorry for the ramble üòè but I think it s important for you to know that you have an amazing staff member in Nick and he s restored my festive cheer!   Merry Christmas!!;;;;;2016-12-03T17:06:44+0000;1480784804;2016-12-03 18:06:44;15;9;21;1;31;9;4;5;16;0;15;5;0;1;0;0;0

Following payment I received an email stating that my order (4FHCC74NF) would be available for collection from my chosen store after 3pm today.  I received another email this morning stating that  there s a problem with items in your order  and that I will be refunded in 3-5 business days  with no further explanation.  I telephoned Tesco Direct and was told that it is  probably  out of stock (yet I can still order it online!). I appreciate that stock levels might not be updated every few minutes but I ordered this around 2pm yesterday and your website shows that it is STILL in stock.  I have an extremely disappointed little boy who was excited about decorating the tree this afternoon. When I explained this to your customer service representative he just apologised and suggested I call into my local store to see if they are on stock.  The main superstore is across town so I telephoned to check stock only to hear an automated message stating that they cannot check stock levels.  I have experienced good customer service from Tesco in the past but this has certainly put me off purchasing online goods from you in the future.  I would be grateful if you could resolve my complaint. I just want a tree this afternoon so that my son is can decorate it as I had promised him.  I look forward to hearing from you shortly.  Kind Regards  Claire Betteridge.;;;;;2016-12-03T09:22:38+0000;1480756958;2016-12-03 10:22:38;2;7;2;0;9;7;4;3;2;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I wanted to write on here to publicly say a huge THANKYOU to your staff members at Tesco Addlestone (Station Road  Addlestone  KT15)  I am a committee member at my daughters charity funded pre school. I have spent the last week or so desperately trying to find donations for our Christmas fair after our main source of donations backed out with less than a week until the fair  we had literally nothing. I think in total this week alone I have been to at least 30 shops asking if they could help us out  I had up until Wednesday one donation of some mince pies ! On Tuesday I spoke to a staff member in your addlestone store to see if it was something they could do  to donate anything. I was told that sadly the lady I needed  called Jane wasn t in. I explained the position I was in and the fact it was for a pre school and a staff member actually went and called the lady on her day off. It just so happened she was actually in the store shopping. The lady didn t think twice and came and took my school letter and said there would be a gift card waiting for me Thursday morning and that I could either use it to buy prizes or use it as a prize. I was so grateful to finally have someone help. Up until then the reception I had had from other companies was disgusting and downright rude. It was so nice to find someone helpful which was still prepared to do what they could even on a day off.  Thursday came and I collected my voucher. Myself and the school secretary agreed it was best to use the voucher to get a few smellie sets and toys for prizes. So I went upstairs with my voucher and went hunting for bargains. Upstairs I saw a gentleman reducing a few toys. I cheekily asked if he was reducing anything else  explained my story again and how I had been going from shop to shop all week asking for help and just being turned away. I was literally ready to give up. The gentleman said to me  go and do some shopping or get a cup of tea  you ll have to give me half an hour and I ll see what I can do . I went with my daughter and we had a drink in the cafe and sure enough half hour later we were found by a man carrying a bundle of reduced items for us. It had electrical items  toys   headphones  computer games  I was speechless. So much so that I had to do my best not to cry. Then as if that wasn t enough he went off and came back with a coffee maker.  When I got back to my car I sat and cried. I ve been spoken to like rubbish  ignored and borderline shooed out of other shops this week  some of them well known companies. But the kindness and generosity of one store completely made up for it and we were able to fill our raffle with good prizes and it meant I didn t need to spend the gift voucher either.  I honestly can t say thankyou enough to Jane and Mark (I believe was the electrical manager) for everything they did. To help on a day off and to run round finding things I could have and coming to find me in the he store with prizes was above and beyond what I should imagine is their job. Our little pre school had the fair today and we made nearly ¬£400. We can now make our way to ordering a new climbing frame for them and other much needed resources. I know I have said it lots but honestly  thankyou for the help given to the school and thankyou on a personal level for not making my week a complete disaster;;;;;2016-12-02T21:03:28+0000;1480712608;2016-12-02 22:03:28;21;8;24;2;34;8;7;1;7;0;21;3;0;0;0;0;0

Yet today 2nd December 2016 at 4:30pm I had a very unpleasant experience at your store that has shaken my belief in your ability to provide customer care at all times.  After a day out doing Christmas shopping with my son we needed to call into the store to pick up some wrapping paper and bits of food etc for my son as it was the only available time he would have to do this  being back in work the next day within the hospitality business. My daughter who attends Runshaw college had forgotten her keys and phoned to find out where I was so I suggested she met me and my son in the store to pick them up as her father was picking her up at 5:30 for the weekend and she needed to get her clothes etc ready..  After putting the bits that we needed into the trolley   including three bottles of larger and three bottles of cider for my son to take home with him we went to try and find till that was free. There were only a few cashier operating and the store was busy so my sun decided to use the self check out service. We put the food through the till and obviously with alcohol the staff need to check id etc which I appreciate‚Ä¶Me being 49 It wasn‚Äôt needed but my son is 25 and had id with him. He was then told that as my daughter was stood with us he was NOT allowed to purchase the alcohol because it was ‚ÄòAgainst the Law‚Äô and was asked to take them off his bill.   I explained that I was well known in the store and shop there most days and most of the shop workers know me  not only from shopping but I also feed the homeless in the local area and get some very much appreciated donations from Tesco. Also it was Not a Law or an Act if the person purchasing the alcohol had valid id. The staff member then said that it was Tesco Law and policy and it was not going to be allowed also mentioning that she couldn‚Äôt use her common sense in this issue as they were not allowed to at Tesco?  Not only was I deeply embarrassed by this situation as it was at a busy time and people were watching but we were 100% innocent in our purchase yet were made to feel extremely uncomfortable. I understand that there is a big issue with under age drinkers and I absolutely stand by the fact that it has to be stopped but in this incident I feel the store was completely out of order. Yet I was told that it was the ‚Äòlaw‚Äô that if an underage child was with an adult and they are purchasing alcohol it is NOT allowed. I wonder how many families come through your stores each day with children under the age of 18 doing their weekly shop with wine and beer etc in their shopping trolley. If what I was told was the Law then I have to say ALL these people must have their alcohol removed from their shopping as we were made to this afternoon?  We were abiding by the law and had id and were both over the age of 18..especially me!!! If you are to have standards in your store they have to be fair and they have to be followed through with EVERYONE who shops in any of your stores.   I am a decent parent and do NOT allow my daughter to drink alcohol nor does her father yet we were persecuted for no reason what so ever and made a complete mockery out of. It ruined what had been a very nice day with my hard working son who I see very little of at the best of times.  Rules are there to abide by but you have to allow your staff to use common sense and also to judge a situation in the appropriate way.   My son asked as my daughter had gone to meet her dad if he could then come back and purchase what HE needed and was told categorically NO!!!! He is nearly 26 yrs old with id and again I say I am 49 and as it stands we were pretty much told tonight we can not purchase alcohol from Tesco???? I went to the smaller Tesco on Canberra road where I know the manager well and told him and to say he was shocked was an understatement as he knows the sort of person I am and they also help me with the homeless donations. This small Tesco is a credit to your store and the staff have always been absolutely lovely with everyone who goes in  its just a shame the main store in Leyland has let your company down.   Legally we were completely entitled to purchase the items required and it is NOT against the law if you are over 18 and can prove it. I would like to think that this isn t going to happen to any other decent hard working people again and maybe a bit of training in this matter may be required because obviously they were completely out of order and had no idea what the Law  and Acts regarding underage drinking are!   As a long term customer I will now reconsider shopping at this store due to the embarrassment caused by the scene that was made when I asked to speak with the store manager. I was told no one was available. Well it‚Äôs the general public who buy the produce that pay YOUR wages so a bit of compassionate customer service would have been expected and appreciated.

Due to this short notice  I needed to get some travel adapters. I checked on your website to see if you sell them - you do  excellent! I get to the store  wander around the electrical department for ages  can t find them. Wait in the queue for the click and collect - some in stock  awesome. Oh wait  they can t be delivered tomorrow because it s after 3pm on a Friday  and the earliest they can be in store is Monday. I m flying out tomorrow evening. Frustrated  as I saw them on your website as in stock and not on click and collect. Ask a colleague walking round who says they should be in the electrical department. Queue again for the electrical desk  only to be told that they are in stock - in the pet food isle. Why on earth are they in the pet food isle?!?! No wonder I couldn t find them! A little bit of common sense when deciding where to place things in the store would bit a bit helpful. The gentlemen on the electrical desk was very helpful and apologetic  but next time you make a design layout please try and make it make sense. When I have a lot of things to do  silly layouts only serve to stress people out more. Otherwise  you re awesome.

I ve sat waiting and checking each day to see if they have been released  currently the latest date is Wednesday 21st December.  My customer advised me today that they got released on the 26th November.   She logged on with her PC and it displayed the slots available  obviously now all the Christmas slots have been taken. There was one slot left on Friday 23rd. So I quickly logged on my app to book it and still only displays dates up until 21st December!

I mainly do my shopping online and like Karen asked in her post would like a way to donate to charities ie food banks rspca etc while online shopping and possibly even a round up function to donate money. Second the odd times I do come in store I normally have my 6 month old son with me. If he is in a pushchair and I only want a few bits would love a basket on wheels so I don t have to carry a full heavy basket while pushing a pushchair.

In the Black Friday sales I ordered an Amazon fire tablet bundle which came with with a case and a memory card for ¬£49.99. I paid for this purchase on 25/11/2016 and it was meant to be delivered with my grocery shopping today.  When the Tesco delivery driver arrived with my food shopping he informed me that my order had been cancelled or damaged he didn t know which one it was.  I rang customer services to find out what was going on and they informed me that my product arrived in my store (bradley stoke  Bristol) on the 28/11/2016 and was checked by the staff and product was fine. But today 01/12/2016 at 11.22am it was found to be damaged. Whilst speaking to the customer service team they promised me that when my item came back into stock (as it is now out of stock) I could have my item delivered but they couldn t tell me when that would be. I rang back 30 mins later and I was informed that I was now getting a refund which I hadn t asked for and that I would have to pay again when my item came back into stock. I then asked if I could have the items separately and obviously get it for the price I originally paid. They informed me that I could do that but I would have to pay an extra ¬£69.72 to get the items and then they would refund me the difference. I can ill afford to do this especially so close to Christmas and bills coming out. I am shocked at the level of incompetence of your staff who have clearly somehow damaged my purchase whilst in their care. I am also clearly angry at the lack of communication I have received. I am also upset and confused as to why I would have to pay the extra money when I haven t received the money I originally paid back into my account.   Nobody seems to know what is going on and the level of customer service is shocking. Considering I pay for your delivery saver and spend the amount I do with your company monthly. My purchase was meant to be my 9 year old sons main Christmas present so I have now had to go to Amazon directly to the items in order to make sure my son gets his present. No offer of compensation for all this suffering has been made. I am seriously considering shopping elsewhere from now on. I thought your motto was every little helps  nobody has helped me at all in this matter.;;;;;2016-12-01T20:22:19+0000;1480623739;2016-12-01 21:22:19;1;16;3;0;19;15;9;6;9;0;1;0;1;0;0;1;0

First they stopped selling the bread and were making a multi seeded loaf instead. Either when enough people complained or sales tanked they bought the lovely bread back...... a couple of times I bought the loaf recently and thought they had mislabelled it as it was full of seeds a different colour texture and flavour  this last occasion when shopping at the Kingston store it was again this yucky seeded bread so I asked to be told this was the malted grain bread and that was the recipe head office were sending. If your going to change a product that drastically  rename it don t try and pretend it s the same thing! Then the turkey bacon disappeared from the shelves to be replaced by Tesco own turkey rashers (now I know Tesco do this regularly sell something and then make their own version and stop selling the original and the Tesco version is usually not as nice) but not as nice doesn t cover this the turkey rashers are horrible they are tasteless have questionable pieces of turkey that are not meant to be eaten in them and are not even remotely likeable. When the Tesco replacement products don t work they disappear and as far as I have noticed the originals don t reappear.....;;;;;2016-12-01T18:59:54+0000;1480618794;2016-12-01 19:59:54;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

NEVER again will I eat at your store all the unoccupied tables needed clearing so we moved all the dirty things to another table when our drinks were bought over no offer to wipe the table down or provide a cloth for us to do this. Cutlery was bought over  I would like to say clean however this was not the case. Our breakfasts arrived rather quickly-the only good experience. We commenced to eat however after a couple of bites we knew this was the biggest mistake we made  the bacon was trying to run off the plate it was that undercooked the sausage was black one side and still pink the other we unanimously decided the eggs had been cooked in washing up liquid and 1 person had to dash off to throw up. We decided none of us wished to risk food poisoning for the sake of not wanting to waste food. As we were leaving we spoke to the counter staff stating that the food was extremely poor they asked the manager to come and speak to us upon telling her our issues and telling her it was still on the table if she wanted to check the quality. The manager told us we should have spoken to them and it could have been resolved?!  Maybe the staff require in customer service and complaints management.;;;;;2016-12-01T13:49:49+0000;1480600189;2016-12-01 14:49:49;1;9;1;0;10;9;6;3;8;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I seem to remember that they were ¬£2.50 until very recently.  Isn t this just another example of Tesco raising prices on something so that you can bring it back down to the same price and then claim a reduction? As a company you do that ALL the time and your customers know fine well that you do it all the time - what we really want is stable prices (fairly low but not at the expense of giving your staff a decent wage!)  Tesco has only just started to regain some of the customers it lost to Aldi and Lidl and when that great exodus occurred many analysts put it down to the lack of honest price transparency in Tesco (where prices go up and down all the time and where they get put up to crazy prices for a few weeks so that you can claim they have been reduced). Continuing to do this rather annoying business practice  which may keep within our rather weak laws  comes across to many of your customers (including me) as a rather awful business practice.;;;;;2016-12-01T10:47:56+0000;1480589276;2016-12-01 11:47:56;0;5;0;0;5;5;1;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0
