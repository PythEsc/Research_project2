The lady s shopping was brought round in bags and hung on her chair and she was offered help to make sure nothing was in her way as she left.   The gentleman was served with acceptance and respect and was chatted to and treated totally as an equal.  The staff were all so naturally welcoming and obviously do this sort of thing all the time - good for them!;;;;;2016-08-31T21:27:18+0000;1472678838;2016-08-31 23:27:18;0;4;0;0;4;4;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My daughter (4 years old) has a broken leg from a combination of; her brother  a firemans lift and a trampoline (it was never going to end well). This has made her summer holidays suck somewhat. Jill noticed her whilst in store today and came over to talk to her about it all. My little one explained we had glitter in our trolley so we could make her cast both girly and sparkly. Jill did no more than remove the item from our scanned items list and told us it was on her. I realise a couple of quid to Tesco is nothing but it was the humanity that counted. My girl was over the moon  particularly when Jill said she was her  hero of the day .

The store was open (24 hours) but that department was closed so I was told to call back anytime before 8pm. Couldn t customer service just deal with it? Very annoying!  I thought I d try the other store about a mile away buckshaw tesco  this store hasn t got a technology department but were more than happy to give me a replacement. How s that work? A bit of consistency please tesco!  My first tv lasted 3 weeks my replacement 2 weeks. Same fault same TV. I returned it to buckshaw today and was told to ring blaupunkt. The lady behind customer services (not the technology dept they don t have one)  shell  rang them for me. Blaupunkt told me it was a known fault and to address it they would send me a link via email containing a software update that I would have to load onto a USB and put into my tv. I don t own a USB stick or a laptop to do this and why should I anyway? I told shell I just wanted a refund as it was the 2nd Tv and that I had bought a replacement already from argos as the TV was for my elderly father and I didn t want to leave him without a to. Shell then had to ring tesco tech department explained the situation and passed me over. They decided they couldn t do anything as blaupunkt had givin me a resolution. I explained I didn t have a USB or a laptop or the time to be messing. They suggested I buy a USB and go to a public library to download the software and update my tv. Really? You are selling faulty TVs (comfirmed by blaupunkt) and expecting you d customers to fix them themselves? Surely they should be recalled by tesco  updated by blaupunkt and then put back on your shelves? The tech department said the decision was final and that was that. Luckily shell agreed with me that the situation was ridiculous and that I shouldn t have to go to a public library to download software that should already be on the tv and called  duty  Alex. He was a very helpful young man and my tv was refunded. Alex and shell are a credit to the store.  So my complaint.   All stores should be able to return any goods even if the department is closed.   I made 5 trips to two stores to buy 1 tv.  I was in the store for well over 30 mins which to me should have been an in and out refund.  The tech support team are useless and very unhelpful.  You are selling faulty TVs!  A terrible shopping experience.  A big thankyou to shell for her patience and Alex for his understanding and humanity!;;;;;2016-08-31T18:27:47+0000;1472668067;2016-08-31 20:27:47;1;2;1;0;3;2;2;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I would like to see a change to the recipe of your frozen potato croquettes  i have not had any trouble with any other brand of croquettes besides tescos brand. The issue is they simply do not cook very well with many cooking methods. in the oven i follow the instructions and cook to specifications  they still look as though they came out the packet. so i performed a test and cooked another brand of croquettes and they cooked in far less time and actually looked as if they where cooked. Whereas your brand where just very hard and didn t look appealing  nor taste as if fully cooked. i then tried frying  again the other brands where no problem they cooked perfectly fine. but yours where still ice cold on the inside although browned on the outside  on further attempts i cooked them at a much lower temperature to heat them through and fryed them slowly at the higher temperature . although cooked well throughout and outside the coating was way too hard on them. so in a sort of conclusion to these light tests i have determined that maybe the recipe of the coating of the croquettes should be chnaged  the potatoe on the inside is fine as it is simply mashed potatoe and that cooks fine. if anyone else hads ahd issues with tesco brand croquettes give this a like and we shall see if tesco listen and offer up a new improved recipe.;;;;;2016-08-31T17:14:48+0000;1472663688;2016-08-31 19:14:48;1;5;1;0;6;5;3;2;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I received a call at around 4 informing me we either needed to pick up our shopping (we had a 6-8 slot) before 6:30 or go via customer services and ask for a specific person  as there was no one available to work in the collection pod after 6:30.  My husband finished his shift at 7  so went to collect it  I d informed him of the phone call  so off he went to customer services.  He was then told to go to the pod......pointless phone call earlier then.   On arrival  he was given 3 bags of shopping that weren t ours  so he told the person there and they replied with  so where s yours then?!   They then had to root through several crates to find ours  which had been stickered up wrong.  My husband then came home  half an hour later than he should ve been  and left me to unpack it all....  ALL my fruit is missing.  The frozen stuff that had been labelled wrong was almost defrosted  the meat was in with some donuts (yum!)  and said donuts were so hot they d sweated off their icing.  My meat was warm  and I know its a warm day  but as warm as the bread was isn t acceptable-not sure if its even edible now.  I ve literally got less than half my shopping that I know is useable  because most of that is non perishable items  or toiletries.  Tomorrow my husband is off work  we had hoped to take our children for a day out  before they go back to school-but now I have to factor in a food shop we had intended to avoid by doing it online!!!!!!!  I sent the above to tesco on here. And at first they did the whole  we are truly sorry nonsense . After taking my details they told me they could reorder my missing items but it would obviously cost me  then that they d get someone to call me tomorrow to sort re-delivery if needed  even when I d said because it s literally everything fresh that s missing I need to get it asap in the morning - it s my kids fruit veg and lunch stuff for christ sake!  I got asked to send the list of missing and things with an issue which is LONG and once I d wasted my time sending that  I was then told to take my receipt into store to sort a refund for all things missing. As if that s going to work when the store have no idea I ve been told to do this.   So now I m without most of my shopping because of a basic staffing issue that could ve been avoided.   I ve spent all night trying to sort it and ended up out of pocket  no decent food in the house and now time taken out of the last day my kids have off with their daddy because we need to go shopping.   Thanks tesco! Never mind I shop once a week with you online and spend £350 a month. Customer loyalty isn t in this shops vocabulary.;;;;;2016-08-30T22:09:29+0000;1472594969;2016-08-31 00:09:29;0;1;1;1;3;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0

I always use scan and pack when I shop in tesco as I find it a lot quicker than checking out at a till point.  On Saturday we purchased a few items at the Tesco on the Yarmouth/Gorleston retail park. My husband went to a normal checkout to pay. After his receipt came out he then got 4 vouchers including £9 of a £60 shop. I was really surprised with this as I have not received any vouchers like these for months. I thought it was funny so when I went in today to do a £85 shop using scan and pack I mentioned this to the assistant who confirmed what I thought and that when using this service you do not get any money off/points bonus vouchers.   This is disgusting and not fair  why should we be penalised for using a service that saves Tesco time and money but takes us longer to shop. In my eyes we are all customers and spending money so why not treat all the same. A very unhappy customer.;;;;;2016-08-30T21:22:33+0000;1472592153;2016-08-30 23:22:33;1;2;1;0;3;2;2;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am referring to your own-brand washing up gloves  or as I prefer to call them  the slipperiest thing known to mankind. With this product you have turned a laborious daily chore into something more akin to wrestling an excitable snake covered in baby oil.   Now I am a fit 28 year old  without the least tremor in my hands  and yet I have just dropped and broken a glass (one of my favourite  as sods law would have it). I dread to think what kind of hell some of your less steady customers must go through.

The offer on them is amazing and they last  he doesn t leak through or anything. I noticed the design changed a few months ago which didn t cause problems for us at all! I ran out of nappies at the weekend so I went into the tower park Poole store and purchased some more. 3 packets for £10. As soon as I opened them a strong horrible fragranced smell came out. It smelt like room freshener. Since using them my little boy has developed a rash (I cannot be sure if its the nappies - may be a coincidence) every time I put a nappy onto him he cries. The smell gives me a headache so I dread to think what it does to my son.   I am just writing this to see if anything has been added to these nappies? Has a fragrance been added that hasn t actually been tested on whether it s healthy for a baby or not? My little boy is 11 months and we ve never had problems with these nappies until now.   If you could get back to me would be much appreciated 😊  I can t put him on pampers because it gives him a red bum and red weepy marks that look like burns.  I use tesco as they ve always been amazing and it s so close to home  whereas I ll have to change to Aldi or sainsburys which are harder to get to   Thank you   Jade;;;;;2016-08-30T11:05:49+0000;1472555149;2016-08-30 13:05:49;1;5;1;1;7;5;1;4;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I don t know whether or not you ve changed suppliers but the ones arriving in the Magdalen St Oxford store (dated 1 September) had to be thrown out rather than consumed.  I can t provide evidence of this because  as anyone who has eaten boil in a bag kippers knows  the details on the packet disappear once you ve boiled them for 15 minutes as per instructions.

She has recently started having her groceries delivered by Tesco because she is  housebound. The snag is she does not have the internet  so what she is doing is phoning her daughter who lives near Birkinhead with her order. Her daughter is passing her order on to Tesco and my cousins local Tesco in the West Country is delivering. My cousin then sends her daughter a cheque. Is there an easier way for someone who does not have the internet to order from Tesco?  P.S. She is delighted with what she is getting delivered.;;;;;2016-08-29T07:24:28+0000;1472455468;2016-08-29 09:24:28;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Whilst shopping my daughter needed the toilet so rather than dump our shopping my wife asked Jack if there were any toilets.   He was on the till and the only member of staff in the actual shop  he took my wife and daughter to the toilets where there was 2 other members of staff talking and then hurried back to the till.  When my wife and daughter had finished they came back out to find poor jack being shouted at!  1) by allowing them to use the toilet it meant we continued with our purchases and didn t leave the store.  2) if they were shouting at him for leaving my wife alone why didn t one of them go on the till whilst he waited  or at least offer to wait in the back for my wife.  3) there is no way he should have been in trouble  but even if he was he shouldn t have been told off on the shop floor in front of customers!  Once we had finished our shopping we joined the queue to pay  again poor jack was on his own on the till and quite a queue was building  he rang the bell for assistance on 3 separate occasions before anyone came to help him and open another till.  I genuinely think that Jack should receive recognition for the service he provided today  I however feel that his manager and co worker need to be given a serious chat around customer service and teamwork!;;;;;2016-08-28T17:52:09+0000;1472406729;2016-08-28 19:52:09;230;34;236;26;296;33;25;8;87;0;224;6;0;0;0;0;0

While shopping in this store  I was walking behind a tesco security man as he paused briefly and turned into the aisle I was going.  He approached a very young boy  who was down on his knees looking through a box of mini puzzles that cost 1 euro.  Clearly due to the selection of mini puzzles in this box  this young child was taking them out to have a look  and placing them beside the box on the shelf  when the security man asked him what was he doing  the child say he was looking  the security man in my strongest opinion  proceeded to verbally scold the child by telling him not to take them out. I was surprised by this reaction to the child by this security man  so I approached him to say  the child is allowed to look  and he cannot tell the child not to look  the security man took offence in my opinion  to me speaking to him  he told me to go about my business  to which I repeated this is not his job to tell customers they cannot look  again he told me to go about my business  and not to tell him his job  and to get out  which came as a shock  I told him I would not leave  and again that he is security and cannot tell a custom not to look  we are all intitled to look. I m sure this can be seen on your shop recording. I don t think Tesco should allow or permit their security to approach any child that was clearly doing nothing wrong. Itade my stomach turn tp see an adult clearly over step their mark  especially when it concerns a minor. I would like you thoughts and views on this. I hope you take my concerns on board and look into the matter. Kind regards.;;;;;2016-08-28T17:29:05+0000;1472405345;2016-08-28 19:29:05;16;15;18;1;34;14;12;2;14;0;16;0;0;0;0;2;0

I was following it on a main road. He indicated to turn left and he did so I carried on driving and he decided to reverse into the main road. I had to swerve onto the other side of the road to avoid him. What made it worse was I had my 2 young kids in the car and my wife who I was taking to a&e for an injury to her shoulder and neck which this incident made worse. Went into the supermarket to speak to a duty manager. I explained all this to him. There was no eye contact. There was no apology or anything he was so cold didn t even ask how any of us were. I asked when the store manager was in to speak to and was just told he would be in some time tomorrow as he doesn t have any rota hours just comes in when he wants too.

Under the disability discrimination act you have an obligation to protect us from discrimination.  Allowing able bodied motorists to park in disabled bays is considered to be discriminatory. The usual answer is there s nothing we can do  when in fact there s plenty you can do all it takes is the will to do it.  Get your act together Tesco  the disabled pay your wages too.;;;;;2016-08-28T11:27:55+0000;1472383675;2016-08-28 13:27:55;0;17;0;0;17;14;6;8;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I will like to share my thoughts regarding one of your stores policies and here from head office if this is correct.   Last night at 22:56 my Gf and I tried to enter one of your stores.  The doors where already closed with a security guard guarding them fro  the inside.   I was able to get his attention and asked why the store is closed if it clearly states 6am-11pm.  He said we cannot come in and that the close the doors before 11pm.  So him and I had some words my telling him this isn t fair on the public.  He wouldn t  have any of it and made it very clear I would not enter even though I tried to enter to try and talk to a manager of the store.  I then had to go to an off licence down then Street.    The story does not end there.  When I finished in the off licence I walked out of that store and your security personal that closed the store when he felt like it was talking to a man waiting for a bus.  He failed to realise I was standing right there listening to him moaning about what just happened to him.  During his rant he mention how he was going to   punch me in the face   I felt then it was time to let him know I was standing there and heard what he was saying.  He then vented slightly and  I said no point talking to you I wanted to talk to the manager.  His reply to my was  do you think I work for some one? He then answered his own question by saying I don t I work for myself.  Get out    I could be wrong but would like to know are your stores allowed to close befor the stated time?;;;;;2016-08-28T11:24:52+0000;1472383492;2016-08-28 13:24:52;4;4;4;0;8;4;3;1;4;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

We purchased a DVD (The Wave) in Carluke and note...Title in English as with the rest of the cover. We returned home and found that the security tag had not been removed at Tesco and realising the security alarm did not go off. We thought oh well (we have the receipt) We then managed to open the security tab and proceeded to play the DVD. We were shocked to find the DVD was in Norwegian and immediately phoned Tesco Carluke and as we live in Lanark  they advised that if the Tesco in Lanark is a superstore like theirs  we would not have a problem in explaining what the problem was  after all  we noticed in VERY small pring on the back  it did mention  with english sub-titles  but the whole outer casing was in English! We did as suggested go to the Lanark Tesco and explained what had transpired  The security Tab  the language issue etc and was met with  sorry  but regulations state we do not accept a DVD if returned and no refund is possible   this after we said we would choose another DVD of the same value or more! Well  as mentioned  we will no longer be spending £400 pm at Tesco for our shopping and quite honestly  for a huge company to decline a £7.00 DVD refund or swop for another DVD is disgusting. Oh well Tesco  you ve lost yet another valued customer....Lidl and Morrisons here we come!;;;;;2016-08-28T10:27:15+0000;1472380035;2016-08-28 12:27:15;1;7;1;0;8;7;6;1;7;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I got the new pole put in and that one snapt straight away also  rang tesco to say I wanted my money back so the lady said to take the trampoline down and ring them back when it s down  to which I did for a man to say I had to re box the full trampoline or they wouldn t take it and I d only get 10 pound back and he didn t know why the lady didn t tell me that  so I manged to get some boxes and box it all up. Rang tesco up on Friday 20th August for a collection day  I said I couldn t do Monday so he said Tuesday I said yeah that s fine. Gets home Monday to a card to say they had been  so I rang back up and he didn t know why they came out and offered Tuesday for them to come I said yes  a man turns up on the morning with a car full of stuff I said I have 5 large boxes (2 trampoline s) he said oh ill have to get a van here  so I sat in till 7pm and noone came in a van  rings tesco back up and he said sorry how about tomorrow (wedesnday) I said yes  so I sat again all day to noone coming to collect. Yet again rings then back just after 7pm and he gave me the number for Yodel  I rang them (automated system) on thursday morning and got today Saturday for collection to come home Thursday night to a card that they had been for trampoline s  (don t know why because they said Saturday) I have now been sat waiting since 7am for someone to collect as they said today  I can t ring them as like I said it s automated system and tesco weren t much help  if they don t turn up this will be three days I ve sat and waited for them. I have to ring tesco if they don t come and they will investigate it and ring someone within there department as they can t do that now because they could turn up  this is absolute joke  ease I ve already waited in two day s!

Just wondered if you guys could enlighten me as to why your policy when using club card vouchers online differs drastically to in store transactions? Today my wife had ordered a shop  and had delightfully told me that using our club card vouchers had managed to get £37.36 of shopping for the amazing low price of 86p. (Just to save you time on your calculator  that s £36.50 of vouchers!) Now I can imagine like myself  you re thinking  that s a pretty sweet deal! Unfortunately it was too good to last! The wife received a phone call from you  saying that our card had been declined  which was odd because we had just moved £30 into the account yesterday to cover petrol and shopping! Upon calling customer services she was told she had to pay £33 for the shopping! (Literally no idea where this number was pulled from) When she said it was meant to be 86p  the customer service team decided to play what can only be described as  guess the number   and proceeded to change the amount owed 3 different times before settling back around the £33 mark.  So what happened to the vouchers I hear you cry? Well apparently your policy is to take full payment before refunding the vouchers at a later date. (Which to clarify isn t explained anywhere on the confirmation email  not even in really tiny writing!) So here s the thing  why would you take the full amount to refund it back? If I went to a store and used my vouchers at the till  and then was told I d have to pay the full amount and wait on the refund  well  I don t think anyone would be happy with that!  So why the difference? Why haven t you displayed this policy anywhere on the confirmation email?  This is now the second time my family have had to drive the 15 miles to the nearest Tesco just because your online service is appalling. Just check mumsnet  you will see we re not the only ones Sort it out;;;;;2016-08-27T13:59:32+0000;1472306372;2016-08-27 15:59:32;1;5;1;0;6;5;2;3;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Plenty of time to get it with still just under a couple of weeks to go before he starts back. I also have your club card  which  I save all my points for Xmas so any money off vouchers I do get are valuable to me as the only ones I do receive now are ones to get extra points. I picked up 3 packs of 2 short sleave shirts for him. I wanted to also get his trousers from you for the points but unfortunately you d sold out of his age size. Got a few other bits that I needed and went to pay. Everything went through the till as normal and then the problem was the voucher. Could you possibly tell me who s idea is it to have a money off voucher for school valid until the 14th August? When clearly most schools go back in September and with my case cannot purchase uniform until the end of August as I have a child who s birthday is at the beginning. No sorry from the advisor  just took the voucher and threw it away when he could clearly see I was quite annoyed with the situation. Yes it s only £3  but that could be a loaf of bread and 4 pint of milk to someone that needed it from their change of buying the uniform. This is a rookie mistake in my opinion and feel that this needs to be revised for next year.

I paid £197 for two pairs of glasses they arrived to start with fairly quickly. I advised them three times (by going into store and calling the main head office) that I couldn t see. Finally I am told by the head office just pop back to the store they ll retest you yeah right!  No I had to come back a few days later after a major operation I did not need to be making my fourth trip to the optician. But I did to find out that the optician had written the axis as 15 instead of 115 I was offered a bunch of flowers for my trouble at the time I just wanted my glasses so I said no please just get my glasses sorted. Now I have made several calls to the rubbish liars at customer services head office as in the mean time I ve had to love house but my glasses have to go to the original store first.  20 days later my clear pair arrive at Northampton I m called as they need to send them to Ely. They get to Ely three days later to find out that the sun glasses (bearing in mind the hot weather is almost over now) haven t been made yet!!! So I call customer rubbish sorry services again at head office no they haven t been made no due date I ll get a regional manager to call you here I am 5 days later no call!!! Ha ha ha then I m asked to do a customer satisfaction questionnaire are you kidding me!!! Yes in still 26 days later have no second pair no idea when they will arrive and no customer service at all.

Tonight Denise and I mixed it up a bit and had your carbonara chicken for the first time. As someone who hates mushrooms (they fill you up too much  once you eat them there s naw mush-room for anything else) and is always wary of supermarket chicken after the toenail dilemma of  99 I can honestly say it was a taste sensation. We washed it down with your  chunky chips  better know as fat boys that take double the time to cook and they re still rock solid and a bottle (glass) of coke..... purely belter!! I then had the Amazonian Cheesecake which was superb  I got a slight tingle when I swallowed and swear I heard a parrot noise after every bite.... Aware Morrisons are tough competition as their cooked brekkies make yours look like a home-ec class gone wrong and asda with their affordable alcohol and fresh bakery (rolls are all warm and cuddly) so you must be finding it tough. Dine for a ten spot works and we will be back  next time try and make sure you ve stock of the flatbread and the creature packing the shelves doesn t abuse me for taking the chunky chips not in the deal instead of taking the chunky chips in the deal when the only difference is the colour of the text on your below par packaging and an excuse for death breath to verbally abuse me for apparently being colour blind.

He was so lovely and asked both of my children if they would like something   my eldest isn t a fruit eater but the youngest loves fruit! Mat trotted off and came back with a banana  he saved the trip Oliver happily ate the banana and order was restored   A stark contrast to another member of staff who walked by and commented  oh he must be tired  ( yeh mummy too) !

Eg. Bike helmets off at petrol station and get off the bike when filling  was first told it was policy  ITS NOT  I called and was then told it was the law  ITS NOT!!! (Ask any biker  and then ask hoe easy it is to fill when not sat on it)  And then healthy start vouchers every store will take them as long as you know you won t get change if you don t use full amount on the vouchers (e.g £3.10 voucher I found £3 worth of stuff). Tesco refused to take it and also refused to search for a piece of fruit valued at 10p  saying its not their job to do that. So I couldnt get ANYTHING as I had no change on me! They then told me it was a Healthy Start policy. ITS NOT!!!! I have called them.  The staff have been rude and lazy and fail to know how to use any of the self service machines when you have a problem. My daughter had to wait a whole extra hour for her breakfast (didn t realise I had run out) because I spent about 30mins arguing with them in the store.  They don t get managers and will only let you speak a  supervisor  who seems just as clueless. I ve seen them standing round in groups talking whilst customers have been trying to get their attention  self service workers are no where to be seen most of the time so your stood there with the red light flashing like an idiot!  Plus the amount of times I ve tried to buy something and it wasn t supposed to be on the shelves  and yet 2weeks later it s still there fully stocked and priced  I end up spending more money!  And this is just the Callington store!   I know this is a rant but as admittedly your cheaper and you have more variety then the other local supermarket  I use Tesco more so I find all this frustrating. I don t however do large shops in Tesco now  I recommend go further and using Morrisons! (I have friends that work in this store so I hope you understand how difficult it is for me to put this up too);;;;;2016-08-26T09:29:38+0000;1472203778;2016-08-26 11:29:38;0;8;0;0;8;8;2;6;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

You are Britain s top retailer and your values suggest you are  Making a positive contribution to the communities where we operate . I think in the UK s uncertain economic climate it s good to source produce locally where possible  and in terms of the literal climate it s good to purchase items that haven t had to be freighted across the globe  also where possible.  So  when in the UK in the UK s biggest retailer  who sell 77% of their products in the UK  looking at apples and pears  (something the UK produces hundreds of thousands of tonnes of every year)  sitting under a sign that proudly boasts  UK apples and pears are best now   I was pretty annoyed to see that not one single variety of pear and not one single variety of apple was from the UK.  There was Gala  Braeburn  Jazz  Granny Smith  Pink Lady  Golden Delicious  Bramley  Kazi... maybe even more... a lot of stock  a lot of varieties  but not one was a British apple or a British pear.  The majority were from New Zealand  South Africa  Italy  and even Chile  Why?   The signage is misleading and your brand values don t stack up to what s getting put on the shelves in this regard.  Where s all the British fruit and why aren t you selling it?;;;;;2016-08-25T20:16:27+0000;1472156187;2016-08-25 22:16:27;1;10;1;0;11;10;3;7;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Would like to see this stupid decision to remove the saltire being put right from an annoyed customer who shops in tesco everyday  but can quite easily shop elsewhere;;;;;2016-08-25T08:03:57+0000;1472112237;2016-08-25 10:03:57;4;0;6;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;4;2;0;0;0;0;0

There was a security guard smoking there but as it was warm I felt that my need for the shade was greater than his.  As the space was a little small my husband decided to get out of the car before I reversed in. He happened to look at the tyres as I was reversing and when I was getting out he said   omg you have to come and look at this .  I was absolutely horrified when I saw the split in the wall of the tyre; partly because it had had a health check at the dealership a couple of weeks earlier and partly because I had checked them myself earlier in the week.  So we popped into the shop for the few bits and pieces we needed and then went home very carefully because I was so concerned about the tyre.  We would have gone to the tyre man then but he is only open on Saturday mornings so we planned to take it in first thing on Monday.  When I got home I started making lunch only to be called by my husband as two police officers had appeared and were looking at my car. I went straight out to them and told them that we had just become aware of the issue and had already made plans to deal with it on Monday.  I explained about the health check and the check I had performed earlier in the week and they were satisfied I was being open and honest and went on their way.  It was clear from what they said that the security guard had phoned them.  I accept that I was responsible for driving the car when I shouldn t have but our shock and horror must have been obvious to the guard who had clearly overheard our conversation.  I would also like everyone who reads this to consider how often they check their own tyres.  Tesco told my husband  when he went in to ask if it was their policy to check the roadworthiness of all the vehicles on their car park  that the guard had been acting because of duty of care.  I think that the guard at the very least showed poor judgment in his actions and I wonder how he behaves to people who might genuinely make a mistake with their shopping.  And I also wonder why  if they are so concerned about duty of care  tesco allow their staff to pollute the car park by smoking.  If I leave my dogs in the car when it s a bit warm I leave the windows down and have to put up with the stench of cigarettes in my car on my return.  After this experience with them  I will certainly think twice before shopping at any tesco again.";;;;;2016-08-24T21:39:10+0000;1472074750;2016-08-24 23:39:10;0;2;1;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0

When we went to collect them they said they didn t know about the order and then changed to say they had a problem and they were being proven and would be ready in an hour and a half . We expressed that we were not happy but would return in an hour and a half. We then went to complain to customer services who said they would check what the problem was and would phone me to confirm the problem. My husband returned at the specified time to be told there was no order in the book  then they found it  and was then told they hadn t put them in the oven yet!!!! Confused??? Me too  it seems there was a catalogue of errors in the store yesterday as we had no phonecall from customer services either! We finally had our rolls which we had to then cool under fans in order to use them . Yesterday was already a stressful day without all this. I don t usually complain but I was really upset.

I know full well my partner gave him a £10 note because before we left our house I took £10 from my purse and left my purse at home as we were walking the dogs I knew I wouldnt need anymore than a £10 for the carpark on the beach and a drink each  I gave my partner the £10 note to go into the shop with. The staff were disgraceful and their attitude was absolutely appauling. Short changing me by £5 may seem pathetic as its only £5 but its the principle and the staff members attitudes.

Your decision to remove a saltire from produce made or grown in Scotland is disgusting. It shows a lack of respect for the individual nations within our union. It is my opinion that as one of our leading supermarket chains you are in an ideal position to be aware of all the differences between our four member nations. While it is important to remember we are a union  it is also important to give credit where it is due.   Allowing customers to bully you into removing our flag shows you are more concerned with profits than your customers.   I sincerely hope that you see common sense and become more sensitive to the people who buy your products.;;;;;2016-08-24T14:06:47+0000;1472047607;2016-08-24 16:06:47;5;12;5;0;17;11;6;5;10;0;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

It came to 11.07 I still had recieved no delivery so I called customer service they advised I would recieve a call from stretford store to confirm what has happening with my delivery. I recieved a call from Sophie at 11.37 (37 minutes after my delivery time) stating that the driver could not find my apartment- so why didn t the driver ring me and ask me where I live ???? I have had tonsillitis since last Thursday and I am on cocodamol and cannot drive due to my tablets that is the reason I ordered a delivery  now I have no food in my apartment and no way to go out and get any. Sophie from stretford tesco put her manager on the phone and he stated that he has no drivers coming to my area for the rest of the day and offered no alternative to this situation. I am now £91.00 down due to your incompetence . I am now without food. What are you going to do- bearing in mind this delivery was meant to be here between 10-11. I am not happy at all.

In my original order I ordered 400g of loose cooked counter ham  as I am having friends and their children over today and am providing a delicious lunch of ham sandwiches  crisps and other party/picnic type foods!  Imagine my brief disappointment when the delivery driver informs me that this item  was the one that was substituted. When we both looked though we noted that it had been replaced for finest  loose  cooked ham  so to us both that looked an acceptable substitute.  After the driver left and shopping was being put away I noticed that the said ham was in fact in a plastic package  not loose as said on receipt and there is only 125g costing £2.50! Now    as a mother of 18 yrs I am very good at making food  spread out  in the occasion of unexpected people arriving for dinner  but I feel that even in the style of Jesus during the feeding of the 5000  I would struggle to make 125g of ham stretch to the equivalence of 400g - perhaps I could put a small piece in the corner of each sandwich so it  looks  as though it s packed with delicious ham? I telephoned customer services and I was offered a refund of my £2.50  for which I am grateful  but this does now mean that I have to get my children ready and go out and drive to my local  nearest (competitor) supermarket and purchase more sliced delicatessen products.  This one item seems to be an issue for the pickers at your Stafford store as it is always the one I have problems with - maybe they have had a bad experience with Teddy Bears and now have an aversion to  picnic  style food  I don t know? Still  I suppose the product received today was better than the day I received raw chicken breast instead of cooked sliced chicken - DIY deli chicken perhaps  could be your next marketing drive(?).  Now I must dash as the good people at JS Sainsbury s are waiting for me with their sharpened meat slicer and their plastic gloves. I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

I buy in excess of 60 pots per week and with my other shopping spend between £150 and £200 a week in your store. I went to buy my porridge last week and found that there was none (this has happened before hence my trips as far as Leeds) anyway I spoke to the stock manager who was lovely but who advised that due to it being removed from sales. She explained that they had no control over it as it had come from head office. It isn t a slow seller which she confirmed as I buy everything that you have in store. The lady has said she will try to reorder it in in 4 weeks time once the system has been unlocked but by then I will have gone 3 weeks no food!! I went to have a look yesterday at the new cereal line implemented to replace the special k ones and they are all Tesco own brand  none of them nice  none of them meeting the restricted sugar allowance I have.

I have already emailed Tesco Customer Service to advise them of this. I suggest ANYONE can do this - there is no need to be confrontational or rude about it....just save your alternate choice grocery bill  head for Tesco afterwards  speak to the Duty Mgr & continue to do this every time you shop until they get the message.

Fortunately  I was able to show the police officer the email containing the policy  confirming that the car was insured  and was allowed to go on my way  with a car full of kids crying hysterically because they thought mummy was being arrested. This was the first time in 30 years of driving that I had experienced this and I have to admit I was scared. Anyway  fast forward to today  when I return home from my holiday to a letter from the Motor Insurance Bureau  informing me that the  record of insurance for my motor vehicle...does not appear on their database . I m horrified. There has clearly been an oversight on your part and I would be very grateful if you could rectify this as soon as possible. Thank you.;;;;;2016-08-23T22:08:36+0000;1471990116;2016-08-24 00:08:36;1;11;1;0;12;11;11;0;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have shopped in your local store since it first opened in my community but I feel I get a better deal from Aldi just around the corner from Tesco. You see my problem does not imply that your staff are below par but instead your morals. Aldi are not afraid to show the fact that they sell Scottish products by proudly displaying the flag of said Scottish products. Does this mean that you will remove the Polish  Italian and Chinese products from your store because obviously I am deeply offended that I can easily find FOREIGN products by their labels/flags/language but I have to read labels and spend more time searching the country of origin before I am fully satisfied that I am eating products from LOCALLY owned farms in my LOCAL community in SCOTLAND. Now if you feel that the flag of Scotland is offending your customers in SCOTLAND then surely when you had the BRAZIL flags all over your store the ARGENTINIANS  MEXICANS  URUGUAYANS  and the like of all other SOUTH AMERICAN countries also took offence  it was RIO 2016 and NOT Brazil 2016. The same as it was LONDON 2012 and NOT England 2012.;;;;;2016-08-23T21:36:55+0000;1471988215;2016-08-23 23:36:55;8;6;8;2;16;6;6;0;7;0;8;0;0;0;0;0;0

Due to a small group of English people complaining about the saltire being on produce from Scotland.  You changed it to the Union Jack.    Are we now to assume that you are also changing English produce to the same flag.  Will Red Leicester cheese now no longer have the Saint George??  By bowing too this sort of nonsense just causes more divide between the two countries.  Please stop this stupidity and return the saltire as it is just a mark to show which country is was made/produced.  Yours  Very annoyed at your lack of thought Former customer.  P.s.  Yes I know I am one person but this topic has a wide audience on social media.  The people are many..  To the original complainers  shame on you.

I visit the store once a week for my shopping (and everyday in between for something I forgot) so i know a few staff members by face and name. Today whilst shopping with my three year old (a now painless task thanks to the free fruit initiative). I get to the till and he decided to go behind a sign and promptly fell and hurt his leg! Cue screaming child!!The store manager (Matt) could see (and hear) the commotion and came over swiftly and began unpacking my shopping onto the conveyer   whilst the checkout assistant (Debbie) was talking to my son about helping to put the shopping through and distracted him from wailing!! The store manager and another member of staff (Susan ) then asked if I needed help packing my shopping too!! I feel the staff at the store are always really helpful and friendly and deserve a mention (and maybe some personal recognition from head office) Especially since two weeks ago the same child was upset again at the till and Lillian the checkout assistant was again marvellous at helping and distracting!!

Is there a logical explanation? And where will this denial of Scotlands existence stop. You are undermining our identity and caving in to an anti Scottish mentality being promulgated in the media south of the border. If goods are produced here then identify them as such. I think I am not alone in feeling that this is a degrading insult to Scotland.

I have found out the most of the cameras on the bletchley extra store are not recorded because your staff told me. My Bike was vandalized in your bike rack outside the main entrance last night between 6pm and half past. I asked to look at the CCTV today to be told the camera aimed at the bike rack is not recorded!!!! I will refrain from using the words i want to use but I put my bike there thinking it was safe with a camera pointed at it.  I use that store normally twice a week and the local store on buckingham road 2-3 times a week minimum for my daily stuff. I put my trust in you when i mistakenly thought your cctv was looking after me and my bike  keeping us safe. You betrayed that trust and now its going to cost my £50 to replace the tires and inner tubes that were slashed.To add insult to it all i was going to buy the replacements from you online because i thought you are kind enough to look after your customers and their bikes. Im glad i didnt know the tire size lunchtime now.  I will not be using any of your stores from now on. I will use asda for my main shop and the co-op for my daily stuff. So disappointed after the nice comments i put on my post yesterday about the incident.;;;;;2016-08-23T17:25:59+0000;1471973159;2016-08-23 19:25:59;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Not only that she unloaded my trolley for me  then scanned it all and packed it all for me while I entertained my little boy.

Clearly they are not professional painters as professional painters are men who have learnt their trade. Though I am sure they are doing their best a lot of paint is going on the floor which doesn t look good. Also  curiously  they are painting perfectly good stainless steel bollards with metallic  paint. ( a bizarre thing to do to stainless steel) Now I realise Tesco s profits are in the doldrums  but doesn t using untrained people to do what should be done by a tradesman portray a rather strange amateurish image to customers?

I delayed by taking a walk with my small person  we visited the park and went to a baby group. However  I could delay no longer. The reality of the one slice of bread and no milk was real. We trudged round Tesco  aforementioned small person strapped into the child seat of the trolley. All was fine... Until we got to Aisle 18. A melt down was brewing. The child wanted out. Desperate to avoid what every parent fears the most - a super market tantrum - I dutifully lifted Small from the trolley. Let me tell you that lugging your 11 month old  who weighs over 30lb  whilst tying to steer a trolley is no mean feat. I kept trying to put him back in the trolley  but he was having none of it. With a shopping list as long as my arm  I plodded on. I had a sweat on at this point  ready to abandon the trolley. Just how essential is toilet roll anyway?   That is until we reached what I can only describe as a beacon of light: a tray of fruit with the heading  Free Fruit For Children - Help Yourself!  Above it. Said child loves fruit  as in really really loves fruit. Thanks to the free satsuma  I managed to get my small person into the trolley seat and complete my shop with no further meltdowns.   Now  if only you could provide a shot of whiskey for the parents as well as fruit for the children  I would really enjoy the weekly shop!;;;;;2016-08-23T15:45:01+0000;1471967101;2016-08-23 17:45:01;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I pointed out that all the purchase info was still on the box including perhaps the colour of my eyes  The assistant still would not budge. I also pointed out that the trolley I had with me contained £99 plus of groceries that I had just purchased. Made no difference he still insisted that I pay for the charger. Needless to say they will not be seeing me again;;;;;2016-08-23T14:17:25+0000;1471961845;2016-08-23 16:17:25;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Tescos remedy for this seems to be to pander to their whims and instead impose a Union flag on all of us.   The saltire not only serves to instantly give an instant visual indication of origin  but also a brand image of quality assurance along the lines of Scotch Whisky  Scotch Beef  Scottish Salmon etc...    For Tesco to ditch this in favour of imposing the Union flag on us makes a total mockery of claimed pride in Scottish produce.  Why not add a St Georges cross to English based produce to satisfy their sudden new found pride. I wouldn t find that in sny way offensive at all. The packaging mechanism clearly exists already.   No matter  in response to this ill thought out decision  I ve made mine  and my fruit and veg will now be sourced from outlets that aren t scared to promote the saltire flag such as Morrisons  Aldi  Lidl  etc...;;;;;2016-08-23T13:48:54+0000;1471960134;2016-08-23 15:48:54;4;7;4;0;11;6;6;0;10;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Very informative. At 6.50pm my delivery arrived and the driver who s name was Alex  couldn t of been jollier if he tried. He asked how I was  if I had had a good day and asked if I d had tesco delivery before in which I said no. He also apologised for the delay. He went through everything on the receipt list with me  explained each section and showed me the substitute that I had received. He then helped to unload the shopping from the crates and asked if I d like a hand taking it to the kitchen as some bags were extremely heavy - but I managed myself.  He then showed me the phone number and said any problems please call this and mention my name as the driver.  SO Alex  whoever you are and wherever you may be..

Today I went shopping in this store with my 3 year old daughter. On the way round my daughter managed to lose her little mouse teddy from the story Gruffalo named  Mousey .   On asking your staff if anyone had handed him in  they contacted customer services  but no one had. A staff member Becky & one of the security staff began a sweep of all store aisles to look for Mousey  but we couldn t find him.   Another member of staff mentioned they had seen a little boy with his dad or grandad go through the checkouts not so long ago with  Mousey . My little girl was terribly upset as she takes Mousey to bed at night with her.   Becky showed great empathy & compassion & comforted my little girl by fetching her something else to play with & cuddle. This cheered my little girl up no end.   In a world so full of negativity & criticism  I thought it only right to let you know about this brilliant piece of customer service  & I hope Becky will get some sort of recognition for her hard work.  Kindest regards  Kelly;;;;;2016-08-22T17:30:23+0000;1471887023;2016-08-22 19:30:23;7;12;7;1;20;12;6;6;0;0;7;0;0;0;0;0;0

His observation and great memory made him realise it could be my phone and he was right. He handed my phone back to me in one piece. His kindness and attitude is priceless.

My mum recently won £20 on a scratch card and took it to your Goole store to claim it. As she doesn t do scratch cards often she was un aware of how they work  but I checked the card which showed 3 matching amounts of £20. I also won on the same type scratch card and cashed it elsewhere. So I am absolutely disgusted that the collegue that served my mum told her it had only won £10 and that you don t win 3 matching amounts you win whatever the bar code says. My mum been too polite didn t challenge this. I am so angry that this store collegue has dwindled my mum out of half her winnings when she hardly ever wins anything.

Whilst I appreciate having large groups of schoolchildren in the store may prove disruptive I see absolutely no reason why pupils can not go into the store alone or even in pairs. Parents are not perfect  what if a child needs something for their lunch or a more personal product. The explanation of  well if she asks a member of staff at the door to get the thing she wants they might get it for her  I m sorry this is just not good enough this store is discriminating a group of customers due to the behaviour of a few and it s just not acceptable.

As a regular customer I can also appreciate the need to cut down on non-customers using the car park because it s free; there have been so many times I ve spent 20+ minutes driving round looking for a space  but if this system is implemented I will be taking my custom back to Asda.

Just a very quick moan about the new lid design on your baby wipes.... I opened a pack of them this morning and will have to open another pack tomorrow as the new design has made it very easy for my 11 month old to open and empty the pack  something that he was unable to do before. I think it is due to the new lip sticking out whereas with the previous design it was inset. Kudos to the designer if they are getting a share of the baby wipes profits. Thanks - he had great fun emptying them. Xx;;;;;2016-08-21T17:36:17+0000;1471800977;2016-08-21 19:36:17;3;22;8;0;30;21;9;12;25;0;3;0;0;5;0;0;0

So  of course I made my way to my local Tesco in Lanark. Bought my veg. Potatoes and a whole chicken......After cooking I started to strip it and found A LOT of water coming out of it  so much so that after it had been placed on a plate the water was still coming out of it. However I decided to put it onto the dinner plates along with everything else but sadly after we sat down to enjoy our Sunday dinner it only got worse. The chicken was vile so it went in the bin along with everything else on the plate! I think it s very fair for me to assume that the chicken was very much so injected with a lot of water to add weight. Well Tesco all I can really say is I will now be shopping further a field in Asda as I have never experienced any issues with any meat purchased from there in any of their stores. Thanks for leaving us starving and feeling let down as well as us missing out on a Sunday dinner!;;;;;2016-08-21T17:27:15+0000;1471800435;2016-08-21 19:27:15;0;8;0;0;8;8;3;5;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Checking a 44-page list of products for one item is completely impractical when shopping in-store. Tesco’s own vegan label printed on the packaging of all suitable products would be much more useful.

Also the food arrived promptly and I was really impressed by the fact that all the items had long dates on  in fact one thing we ordered had a shorter date (which was fine as I could freeze it) but the delivery driver pointed this out to us and we didn t have to accept it if we didn t want to.  Finally the delivery driver was really nice and helpful and didn t grumble about having to come up to the 9th floor!

I ve just went and made it and was met with a horrific smell. Upon checking the chocolate pudding it looked like it may have been over zapped in the micro but the smell was just too bad. I ve now checked the date of the puddings bought today and they went out of date on the 4 August. This makes them 16 days out of date and they were still at the front of your standard dessert shelves when they were bought.  I find it highly frustrating that we frequently shop in store and this is not the first issue we have had with products going out of date or being out of date on the shelves.

We were told that they had to do a search against my club card to confirm that I had purchased the item  bearing in mind I had the till receipt in my hand  anyway we went away and received a call last Tuesday to obtain permission from me to search the club cards records.  As to date we had not received any call back so today we rang to find out was happening only to be told that we will not receive the fund because the search could not find the brought item on that day  and therefore there is no proof of purchase  and have been told that if we go back to the store and they will accept the till receipt along with my club card and debit card and proof of identity and the store accept this as proof of purchase and then they ring the number of the receipt to confirm this I may get a refund   Can anyone advise me what more can I do to prove I have purchased this item  I am a pensioner and can not afford to loose this money  i think  after this I will no longer be a Tesco customer;;;;;2016-08-20T12:30:47+0000;1471696247;2016-08-20 14:30:47;0;22;0;3;25;22;11;11;12;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was quite upset; Jo saw this and asked if everything was okay. My husband explained our dilemma and  Super Jo  went into superior customer service mode!  She went out of her way to contact someone she knew (a colleague called Andy) to check on alternative accommodation; she then contacted the landlady of that guest house & arranged a room for us.

From the quality of food  the friendliness of the driver (Derek from the Dunfermline Fire Station Store)  the explanation of how the receipt  refusal of items and money off items if they are cheaper elsewhere worked.

Normally I go to my local tesco express for baby milk whilst I m doing the school run. With it been the school holidays I ve put my trust in yourselves to pick my baby milk. Over the past 2 wk I ve been a dissatisfied customer regarding the care of baby milk. Last week the little red tab on the milk was just attached  it was hanging on with an inch of its life  this week there was no tab attached so the foil lid and scoop was accessible. You may say this is a silly thing to be picky about but I m sure other parents will understand my dissatisfaction. I ve trusted you to pick my 7wk old sons milk.... how am I to know its not been tampered with and that it was on the shelf with the seel tab on or even in transit with it attached so I ve had to go to store and get a replacement which as a busy parent and not enough hours in the day (hence the click and collect been used) is a slight inconvenience. May I please make a suggestion? When the staff of tesco are scanning this product it be bagged and tied so incidences like this doesn t keep happening. I m rather reluctant to put this product on my shopping list again. I do hope you can take my suggestion into consideration and not just see me as a picky parent.

However  sadly not many of them are actually labeled as such on the packaging  and although the list online is helpful  it s not practical when shopping in store!  Through the 8 years I have been free from animal products  i have noticed more and more tasty things arriving on your shelves suitable for me to eat. However  on quick shops I do not always have the time to read label after label to search out what is vegan and what is not  which means I buy the same things and could be missing out on new things you have to offer  and more often then not do quick shops elsewhere with more clear labelling so I can try new things more easily.

It seems as though they are as attainable as a unicorn steak and not only that  your customer services team in fact know nothing about them.  This issue first arose after making a special effort to try and locate them in the London stores listed as stockists on your website.  None of the stores had them in stock which is why I contacted Customer Services.  The first person told me to check in the stores listed on your website (which was a point I had made clear in my first email) and then told me that there are supplier issues and they don t know when they ll be back in stock after telling me they are not in stock.  Another person apologised for the  rigmarole  and said that the confusion has arisen from the fact that Carolina Chillies go by another name and that they are the Komodo Dragon chillies and widely available.  I was stunned  especially given that the recent press release not only includes a graphic showing that Carolina is hotter than Komodo but that you started selling Komodo chillies in 2015 and that of course they are two entirely different chillies - I am still waiting for a response from Customer Services regarding this.  Your press announcement remains online as do the fanciful stockists and I really would like to know if  when and where in the country they will be available?;;;;;2016-08-19T12:40:33+0000;1471610433;2016-08-19 14:40:33;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

At the time of buying the tablet we were torn between the Hudl   a Kindle  and another tablet (which I think was an Asus one).  We wanted to go away and check on reviews but were pressured into making a decision and took the advice of the store assistant and opted for the Hudl as we were assured our son would get at least 5 years out of it.  To protect it we also bought the Hudl specific case.   Our son rarely uses his tablet   but does play occasional games and research for his homework.  Unfortunately last week he went to switch it on and there was a problem with the screen.  I contacted Customer Service and this was looked into.  I was advised there was a known problem and the Hudl is no longer available   and repairs are no longer being offered and I had to wait on a call back to let me know what you will be offering.  I received contact today offering £35 towards a replacement.  I queried this as although the tablet is outside of its manufacturers warranty   the advice we were given upon buying the Hudl led us to believe that it was the better option instead of the Kindle   or an Asus tablet that was a similar price.  I was told Tesco don t stock Tablets at £35.00 and there is nothing else that can be done as it us a set figure you can offer.   I have looked online and information regarding the Sale Of Goods Act is quite vague but I feel the offer is derisory considering we must have spent over £120 on a gift that is useless after less than half of the time it was meant to last for.  Even the protective case we paid around £20 for is worthless.  We allow our son an hour a night on his tablet if he has been good during the day and he now feels he is being punished and is having  the worst school holidays ever . He is only 7 so hopefully the suffering will soon ease.   Is there really nothing further that can be done regarding this?  Any further help would be greatly appreciated.   Kind Regards;;;;;2016-08-19T11:58:19+0000;1471607899;2016-08-19 13:58:19;0;10;0;0;10;10;6;4;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

(Responsibly within the government guidelines of course) As I m sure you already know Sainsburys have revealed their plans for a bottle under £3. Being a loyal tesco customer  I hope you can understand the discomfort it brings me to contemplate switching over to Sainsburys  however prosecco is a large part of our student lives now and I just dread to bare the thought of a life without it. It seems they re providing that little bit extra now and sadly every little helps  as you know well. I hope there can be some sort of way we can resolve this issue and move forward in our relationship. We have faith in you to resolve this deeply concerning matter  and mend our broken hearts.;;;;;2016-08-18T19:46:38+0000;1471549598;2016-08-18 21:46:38;50;1;53;0;54;1;1;0;6;0;50;0;0;3;0;0;0

Whether it s a Stop-N-Shop in the New England region  Food Lion along the South East  Wal-Mart  Kroger  Farmers Markets in the deep South or some other store anywhere in the country--and out--bugs are a risk you take when buying fruits and vegetables!   This is WHY you re supposed to thoroughly wash your fruits and vegetables! To get them off.  So  stop whining about living and dead bugs on your fresh produce  suck it up  say  oh well!

Your call centre staff  were completely useless  rude and uncooperative. My name clearly is Mr Towers  on the documents we got back I am now known as Mr Howard.   As soon as we saw the issue we called immediately  only to be met by another rude and impatient call handler  we was assured the details would be amended on the 17th of August. This is a great important to us as we needed to print these documents off as we are driving across Europe on Friday for a week or so. We went to re print these documents and yet  no name change.   I cannot stress the importance of this  the details need changing as soon as possible so I can have all the correct documents I need to continue with my holiday.   But come on  I work in a call centre myself  misspelling a name  is an honest mistake  giving me a complete different name is ridiculous.

My  nearly 3 year old son sat it in for the first time today and I can t tell you how much more relaxing my shopping trip was knowing that he couldn t inadvertently injure himself by head butting the handle bar while I was putting something in the trolley.   This positive experience however was dampened by a security guard with little to no a)customer service skills and b) common sense. When leaving the store we unavoidably set off the security alarm (I fully understand why these valuable trolleys are tagged!) We were swiftly met by the guard who stated that under no circumstances could I leave the store with  that  trolley. Well Mr Security guard  how on earth do you expect me to carry my disabled son and my heavy shopping to the car. His response was a shrug. I then explained that the whole point of an adapted trolley was to make life easier and so by not being allowed to step out of the store with it simply defeated the object of having one in the first place!! Thankfully a lady behind the customer service desk told the security guard that  of course the lady can take the trolley to her car!    I believe that some of your staff desperately require some disability awareness training!;;;;;2016-08-17T18:01:16+0000;1471456876;2016-08-17 20:01:16;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I remembered from a few years ago with my older son that there were trollies that you could put your own baby carseat on  so i took him out of the car still in his carseat and struggled over with my large changing bag and shopping bags in tow to the trolly area to grab one to save waking him up. When i got to the trollies i couldnt find any  so asked a member of staff for help. I was unhelpfully told there should of been some there but as there werent any trolly staff in at that particular time they couldnt help me. Concequently i ended up struggling back to the car to take my baby out of his carseat (and wake him up) to put him in a trolly with a dirty baby seat on it  which was miles too big and completely unsuitable for a newborn. Of course the trolly i happened to chose had rickety wheels too so not only was his head wobbling around unsupported  but was banging on the side of the seat our entire visit! This was obviously very uncomfortable for him as he screamed the whole way around the shop! If one of the carseat trollies was available we would of had a problem & stress free experience  instead it was very stressful and not one i care to repeat again. Needless to say until this problem has been resolved i wont be visiting Tesco again. I shall be shopping at one of your competitors stores who value their customers with newborn babies.;;;;;2016-08-17T17:28:34+0000;1471454914;2016-08-17 19:28:34;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

In April I took my car to be cleaned along with a soft top clean. This cost £20 and took 40mins plus 1 hour 30mins wait. When I got the car back they had only done 2/3 of the roof and missed the middle completely. I complained and they offered a free wash and roof clean. Today I have taken it back to get my free roof clean and they told me that it was to long since I d had it done. At no point was a time limit mentioned on the free clean. He would not honour the free clean even though they failed to clean it in the first place. After I told him that there was no time limit stated he agreed to wash the car but will have to wait 1.5 - 2 hours. I can t wait 2 hours  When I asked who was waiting he couldn t say as there were no cars in the waiting bay.

This inconsistent approach can cause confusion as people may think a product that isn’t labelled will be unsuitable for vegans  even if it contains no animal products. I strongly urge you to label all of your own-brand products that are free of animal ingredients and animal exploitation as being suitable for vegans.;;;;;2016-08-17T15:22:44+0000;1471447364;2016-08-17 17:22:44;0;4;0;0;4;4;1;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am here on behalf of myself  anyone else in this country who is looking at going vegan and the current vegans in this country. I see that you already label your vegetarian products as  Suitable for vegetarians  - thanks.  However  there is a growing number of vegans in this country. Many people go vegan for animal rights/welfare  health  environmental  personal  perhaps religious and/or other reasons. Because of all these combined  there are about half a million vegans in this country  along with other people who reduce their intake of meat  dairy  eggs and/or other animal products.  Labelling vegan products as vegans would make things easier for all of these people  especially those who have a limited amount of time and/or are under pressure from parents and/or guardians. Because of this  I would like to politely ask that you label  all of your products that are vegan as vegan.

I visited the store shortly before 12 pm with my 15-year-old step son to purchase myself one bottle of beer. After a short period of deliberation  I opted for a bottle of Franziskaner Hefe Weissbier but whilst attempting to pay for the item  the cashier informed me that he would need to see Identification for both myself and my step son.  I am 34 and always carry my driving license so showing identification for myself is not a problem. However  my step son does not have identification to show that he is 18 as he is only 15  and given that the single bottle of beer I was attempting to purchase was for myself I would have anticipated that his age was irrelevant.  I asked to speak to a Team Leader  who attempted to explain that it was company policy. I asked for clarity as to the age he would be regarded as young enough to not have to show ID  for example if he had been 13 instead of 15 would the same situation arise. Understandably  neither member of staff could answer this question given the policy there were following was clearly not in place for these circumstances.  I had anticipated that common sense would perhaps prevail however it seemingly became a situation of “computer says no”  and both the cashier and Team Leader explained that in order for a 34-year-old with sufficient ID to purchase alcohol  a 15-year-old who was not attempting to purchase alcohol would need to prove that they were older than they were.  This is not the first time I have attempted to purchase alcohol in the presence of my step son  however it was the first time I was refused at point of sale. Whilst I fully appreciate the importance of ensuring age regulated purchases are carefully monitored  I would like to think that Tesco would agree that it is not acceptable for parents to leave their dependants outside a store every time they attempt to such a product.  I would very much appreciate your feedback on this matter.  Neil Bontoft;;;;;2016-08-17T09:47:49+0000;1471427269;2016-08-17 11:47:49;5;13;5;0;18;9;3;6;4;0;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

Well it isn t for me as I had approximately two hours sleep last night & now have a day of work to get through. I would like to know why you had construction/decoration work carried out to the fascia of your Bristol  Church Road store throughout the early hours of the morning yesterday? The work started before 11pm and finished at 4am in the morning. The worst of the noise was between 11pm & 02:30am approx?! I ended up calling the Police (on 101) as the noise from the pressure washer device sounded more like a pneumatic drill but was told as it was commercial & not residential there was nothing they could do. I can only assume that the work was carried out at this time so it wouldn t affect your trade & just affect the sleep of any residents that live nearby said store.

You don t know how to treat your costumers.  I placed an order trough the website and it was supposed to arrive between 8-9 pm. It was 9:45  no one called  I didn t have the order (but of course Tesco had charged me already for the order) and I called Tesco to see what happened. The first girl I talked with told me that the drivers couldn t come because they ran out of time (WHICH IS NOT MY PROBLEM) and the cancelled my order WITHOUT ASKING me. And then she said that she can reschedule the order but then I will be charge another time for the same order before the refund will be processed. I told her that it s not acceptable that nobody called me about my order and then I m gonna be charged two times in my bank account before having the order and because of them I m gonna be in negatives in my bank account. I asked for some compensation and she told me she can t do that. She passed me with her supervisor and the same old story: poor drivers that they dind t have time  my order is cancelled and I can wait 5 DAYS to have my order again so the refund will be processed. So I will be with no food (food that I needed TODAY that s why I payed for the delivery charge)in negative numbers in my bank account and paying the bank s fee because of Tesco s fault and the only thing she can offer me (because I ask for  she wasn t offering ANYTHING) is 10 pounds voucher as  a gesture . A gesture. You didn t deliver my food  you didn t give me any notice  you dind t ask me if I wanted to canceled the order  I m gonna have problems with my bank  and I don t know when I m gonna have the food I needed for today  but  hey  have 10 pounds which is NOTHING for a big company like us as agesture. Like she was making me a favor. I wasn t happy and then she offered me 20 pounds and she couldn t do anything else for me. No way.  It s insane. I feel so mistreated I m not gonna place an order trough Tesco again in my life. I ve never had problems with other supermarkets. Good luck treating the costumers like that and not caring if you lose a costumer. And I will put what happened to me in every single website I find so everyone knows how you work and they cand spend their money in a better place.;;;;;2016-08-16T21:33:41+0000;1471383221;2016-08-16 23:33:41;2;6;2;0;8;6;2;4;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Nessy then told me that tesco are trying to encourage children to eat their 5 a day and there is fruit at the store entrance which I clearly missed. I was very pleasantly surprised. Nessy then came back to me with 2 bananas. My children were thrilled to bits my son in his element showing his banana to everyone and shouting  nar na  with a mouth full!! I d just like to say a huge THANK YOU to Nessy from Hucknall Tesco Extra for saving my shopping trip from becoming a complete disaster 🙌🏻 Nessy is a lovely lady and a asset to your team.

I parked in the parent and child space and thought that it would be easy enough to transfer the twins from car to trolley but this wasn t the case.  I searched for a twin seat and could only find the baby versions. I was just about to drive off when I spotted a member of staff. I asked if he had any available but he couldn t find one either! We looked through the trolley bay and came across one hidden behind about 20 trolleys.  It would be very helpful in the future for parents of young children/ twins if you could have them parked up and ready to use rather than having to look hard for one. Maybe having a row of twin seated trolleys on there own rather than mixing them up with single seated ones would help?? I hope my feedback will be past on to your stores and benefit other parents in the future;;;;;2016-08-16T18:30:13+0000;1471372213;2016-08-16 20:30:13;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

When we got to the check out he began to scream... he has learning difficulties and a severe speech delay  so as much as I asked what was wrong and gave him options I was unable to figure out what was wrong with him.  As you can imagine it s frustrating for both of us and makes me anxious of what people s opinions of us are when he is screaming and I m unable to make him stop.  I finished loading my shopping and the cashier asked me what he wanted. I explained I didnt know. She asked if he wanted to help. I asked him if he wanted to pack the shopping and gave him the bag  the lady scanned the first item and passed it to him as I held the bag open. He then stopped crying!!!  She did this with a few items then I said to her it would take all afternoon to let him do it all and laughed (secretly worrying what his reaction would be when I took over packing).  She went on to tell me not to worry how long it took and to let him do it!! I was shocked!! With this my little boy was happy and the cashier and I were able to have a little chat while he happily packed the shopping.  So Maureen on checkout 17 just before 4pm.. thank you! (I am told her surname is Anderson)  You not only helped me calm my little boy  but you helped me have confidence that not everyone is of the opinion that a screaming child is a naughty one!  You gave a child the time he needed to make his Tesco experience a great one.

On Monday morning my daughter looked in my fridge and said  when did you get these. I said last night why  she said I pk has 28th July the other pk is 26th August. I phoned tesco straight away who said they will exchange the out of date pk  and apologised. I told them I wasn t happy because I d have to make a special journey back (I live about 2 to 3 miles away)  couldn t go on Monday so went today. The duty manager did exchange them but I wasn t happy because 1)he didn t seem to concerned  even though they were over 2 wks out of date  2)all he said was I was told by a member of staff you were coming into exchange them because they were out of date  he didn t apologise just said I can t believe it  they must have been right at the back  3)I would have thought he d offered me something in the way of compensation  expecially when I pointed out that the store could have been in serious trouble had I have reported it to health and safety or head office. My grandson is 5 yrs old and the grandaughter is almost a yr old  if my daughter hadn t have realised they were out of date I would have given them  I dread to think how ill they would have been!

As such  I am glad to see that Tesco is stocking an ever-wider range of specialist vegan products  and labelling them for easy identification. Having access to a range of clearly marked vegan products in supermarkets makes life much easier for me and other vegans. However  I notice that you have many more own-brand goods that appear to contain no animal products and yet are not labelled as being suitable for vegans. This inconsistent approach forces me to laboriously check every ingredient in all of your unlabelled products to see which ones are suitable for me. Using the list of vegan products on your website is also impractical because  at 44-pages long  it is much too large to carry with me and it takes too long to find the right item. I strongly urge you to print the Tesco ‘vegetarian & vegan’ logo on the packaging of ALL of your animal-free and cruelty-free products to avoid confusion and make shopping in your stores easier and more appealing for vegan customers.

It annoys me most of the time when blind  normal  members of the public park in the parent and child spaces when they don t have children but for one of your own members of staff to do it is just a bloody cheek!!

The one bought from Apple was replaced with a brand new phone within 90 minutes. However the other bought from Tesco is a very different matter. They have offered to send it away for 10  days for an attempt at repair before a possible replacement with a reconditioned model if unable to do so. Obviously this is a complete waste of their time and effort as I will not be without a phone for 10 days so am off to  guess where .....to buy a replacement. Yes  Apple of course.  Moral . Don t buy a mobile phone from Tesco s or you might find yourself without one for 10 days.  Obviously I have let Tesco Customer Services know about their lack of service and will let you know the outcome.

As always I needed to pick a few bits up in store before collecting my order. On coming back to my car I had a flat tyre! (A very flat tyre) whilst waiting for the AA I walked over to the click and collect and asked the lady if it was possible for me to walk my shopping over to my car when they were a little less busy (they had a few cars queueing) she said this was fine and to Coke back when I was ready!   I was with my mum who waited by my car whilst I walked to the local tyre shop  when I returned to my surprise the lady had found my car and brought my shopping over and helped my mum put my shopping in my car! This was a lovely thing to do and not something that a lot of people would do! I didn t catch the ladies name but I would like to say thank you to her!  In the same trip when the gentleman who is the car park and trolley assistant realised I had a flat tyre  he came over and tried his best to help but looking at the tyre and even offer wig to help if I needed it! Again I didn t catch his name but would like to say thank you!

Every single time I buy a few items of clothing there is always at least one item that still has a security tag on it.  I can appreciate that along with customer service  security is also very important. However today s purchase consisted of a 3 pack of girls wool tights 7-8 and a 2 pack of bog standard girls leggings also 7-8 and like every other time the alarms don t go off leaving the store. So tonight getting my daughters things ready for school and what a surprise security tags on both items under a fiver  really Tesco?. Are children s tights and leggings that popular to steal in Westhill they need security tagged??. My husband has been stopped before at the same store because the alarm had gone off when leaving.  I m quite relieved to say there was nothing in his bag with security tags still attached which is really lucky however it did come to light it was in actual fact a tag in the pocket of the combat trousers i bought him a week earlier for work.

(though I totally think you should get Cherry pop tarts at the Lynn Tesco on Hardwick cause They never have them)  You even stated carrying Kraft Mac and cheese which is one of my favorite food ever.  I also recently discovered your chilled Chicken Bacon pasta Back.  And it is so good Perfect amount of sauce chicken and bacon!  I was shopping today and got all my favorites but some unhappy happened.  I m not very smart so maybe it was my fault but I m pretty sure it wasn t. I was in the check out line and talking with the nice lady ringing me up ( a collage student who said she s studying for a masters in a new doctors field which is super col she must be very very smart! :)   She was being very nice tome and today was a rare occasion where I was having a god day.  See I m autistic so sometimes I have a really really hard time.  Tesco staff is always really nice to me  and super friendly.  so because I was having a good day we where talking while she scanned my shopping and I packed it.  but at some point (I m not sure when) another customer joined the que (I d like to not that there where other lines  she had less then the limit for the express lane and a lot of the self check out points where open)  Anyway while I was talking this customer Yelled at me.  just right out of no where. Some of my stuff wasn t even done being scanned yet!  I can t move any faster but she treated me like some how her being in a hurry was my fault.  It really upset me.  now this isn t your fault at all Like I said your employees are always super nice. But the lady ringing me up didn t say anything.    I don t know if store policee keeps her from defending customers  but I m worried that maybe I messed up somehow  I don t want to be annoying but I know on my good days  because their not often  I can get enthusiastic  so maybe she was annoyed with me to  but couldn t say so because I m a customer?  I don t know  I m not good with social cues and It seemed to me that our conversation was going very well. but Maybe I did something wrong?  But I don t know what.  and so I ve been really worried that Maybe the reason The lady at the till didn t say anything was because she agreed with the mean lady and was mad at me  but couldn t say so cause of her job?  Um so I was wondering if you could apologize to the cashier for me.  I dunno what her name was she was very nice  she works at the Tesco Hardwick round about in Kings Lynn Norfolk and it was today 8/15/2016 um at around 1:30 2 o clock I think?  I didn t have a watch with me sorry.  Um  But if you could tell her I m sorry if I bothered her I d appreciate it.    Like I said I know that because I m not good with social things i don t always know if I m bothering someone  and she was very nice to me so I don t want to think I was bothering her.  I hope yu can tell her I m sorry.  I couldn t because after the lady yelled I got upset and didn t want to breakdown in the shop so I just paid and left and cried when I got to my momma at the ca. so Please. I d really appreciate it if you could get my message to her.  Thank you very very much.  Oh and again thank you for selling so many of my favorite foods!;;;;;2016-08-15T17:29:59+0000;1471282199;2016-08-15 19:29:59;2;5;2;0;7;5;2;3;3;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

When I asked the staff what was in the rice salad nobody was able to find out :(  Also. the labels are tiny and I see people lowering their heads into to salads trying to read the tiny text which is BEHIND the saladbowls. Can the labels be in front of the bowls?  Today I bought what was labelled as  falafal  but turned out to be onion bhaji. Not a problem for me  but it shows that the items don t match the listing.  Is there a website link showing the salad bar items and the ingredients? I want to buy but I can t if I don t know what I m eating!

I pulled in at 15.40 to get the few bits I needed (only came to £10 to give you an idea). There wasn t a single parent and child bay available (I m a single parent of a toddler and a 16 week all baby). I appreciate this happens  so I park in a normal bay and walk my toddler across the carpark and carry baby over to get a trolley. In all 3 of your trolley bays there isn t a single infant and toddler trolley  so I end struggling to manoeuvre my toddler into a trolley and carry the baby  pushing the trolley with my remaining arm. No raspberries  so I settle for strawberries. I get to the diary aisle and my baby throws up all over herself and the aisle. I inform the lady on the deli counter as I don t want people to slip. And she sighs and says she ll go get a bucket  no particular concern about her welfare (I appreciate that s not her job but  you know). I don t have enough time to change her before closing so I continue to get my items and go to the checkout  to find one of my yogurts had split. Your checkout lady was really lovely and packed my bag for me as she could see I was struggling. I then take the trolley back to the car and unload the children. I take the trolley back to one of your little huts rather than abandoning it like I often see  but as I get there the wheel locks up. Your trolley man comes up behind me and says that it s okay and he ll get it. So I head back to my car so I can get my vomit covered baby home and changed to have your trolley man call after me saying  well you ve broken the wheel . I appreciate it s nearly 4pm and people want to get home  and each one of these incidents on its own is okay  but in combination all of these little things have caused me to come home feeling very deflated about my shopping experience and some of your staff members today.;;;;;2016-08-14T15:39:11+0000;1471189151;2016-08-14 17:39:11;0;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0

I have no issue with the staff working there they are all lovely and polite.  However on my departure I went to reverse and saw the tesco delivery truck coming so I pulled back into the designated car  parking space for tesco next to the bank and sat patiently with my reverse light on. whilst the lorry adjusted parking 3 times. He then blocked me in. I politely waited and after nearly 10 minutes I had enough and went to look for the delivery driver I looked quite cross but said nothing he then stared over at me and with no apology and yelled at me you can communicate with me ! So he clearly realised he blocked me in. After that I then replied you saw me try to reverse I sat there patiently with my reverse light on then you proceded to block me in. even if he wasnt clearly werent looking at his surroundings safely which isnt a good sign if you cant see someone trying to reverse and  someone sat with a reverse light waiting to get out. That is really bad driving.  why would you clearly block a customer in a parking space . You then with ease reversed it back a couple of meters after me saying something to let me out. And to unblock the car park. As you first arrived I got out of the car to look and there were no other cars behind the lorry so why did he just not do this in the first place. So 2 things I am not happy with him blocking a car in a designated car park and his then attitude towards me yelling at me after realising his fault with no apology.

Now I dread walking in to you shops because they are not accessible for me.  I almost always now get the wrong thing because the people i m asking to help me do not understand what I am saying.   This is  I have come to realise  as a direct result of the language barrier.  They do not understand the actual words being spoken.  Also there is the impatience.  While trying to communicate in a way they can understand so that I can get the right things on my list they simply agree with whatever I say and then bring a version of what I ask for and tell me that it is (put in here an exact repetition of the words I used)   It hasn t just happened to me in 1 or even two of your stores.  Is it too much to ask for at least some basic English proficiency in your staff? It is not your buildings that are in danger of becoming truly inaccessible now Tesco  it s your staff.;;;;;2016-08-14T13:05:11+0000;1471179911;2016-08-14 15:05:11;1;5;3;0;8;5;1;4;1;0;1;0;0;0;2;0;0

I have just wasted two and a half hours waiting for my car to get the gold wash/valet. I left my car at 10.45 and was told to come back in two hours  which is what my receipt said. I arrived back at 1pm  giving them a few mins extra to compete the job. My car HADN T BEEN TOUCHED.   It was a bit difficult to understand what the three men were trying to tell me (perhaps at least one member of staff should speak English)  but it was along the lines of they have been busy and it will only be another 20 minutes. So perhaps you could explain how cars that that WERE NOT waiting at the same time as mine to be cleaned had been?   Two hours is a long time to wait  but I needed to do a little shop and thought I d treat myself to lunch in the cafe. No food from the kitchen as the chef hadn t turned up - again  apparently. Fortunately my coffee was good and the poor chap serving was very apologetic. It s not his fault.  Management - isn t that what you should be doing? Not leave it to the poor chap probably earning a pittance to deal with cheesed off public.  So  this was the last straw to many unhappy experiences at Tesco Cirencester.  Appalling service which sadly sums up the general apathetic manner in which most of your staff carry out their duties.   Waitrose and Aldi here I come. However  what I can never get back is the two hours I ve wasted today.   Yours  very unhappy customer.;;;;;2016-08-14T12:24:51+0000;1471177491;2016-08-14 14:24:51;4;3;4;0;7;3;1;2;0;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

We first reported the incident in store on the 2nd July and then having heard nothing from your customer service team (I asked for the incident to be investigated and then a letter from Tesco explaining the reason for the genital pube in the yoghurt) I raised this via Facebook.  As you can imagine we got an instant response  excellent I thought  we are getting somewhere.    The issue was reported via Facebook on the 27th July.  It is now the 14th August.  We have been away on holiday during that time and still no letter from Tesco when we got home.  A big disappointment.  Perhaps I was wrong and pubic hair is a key ingredient in your Tesco Low Fat Berry Medley Yoghurts  if so would you please be kind enough to highlight this on the packaging so that the customer does not get a surprise when they find the pube located within the half eaten pot.  Happy if pubes are part of the manufacturing process  but as I said please can you make this clear on the packaging in the future so that we can avoid having to purchase any products that contain them.  It would be nice if somebody at Tesco could take this seriously as it is a major failure of your GMP processes to allow genital hairs into your products.  A hair from somebody’s head or face you can understand if something finds its way in a product by mistake  but not a genital hair.  Seriously though customer service should be your number one priority  without customers you are not able to function correctly.  One customer has a bad experience they tell 10 people  if they have a good one  they may tell one.  Basic customer service is not hard and an organisation like Tesco should have it down to a fine art.  Perhaps you have just got too big and you no longer care about the people who buy from your stores and pay for your wages.  Once again I look forward to hearing from you (maybe)  an apology would be nice and possibly an explanation about how it happened  how you intend on changing your procedure to hopefully stop it happening again  and also how it has taken you so long to send a letter.    You could have walked and hand delivered a letter by now.  Many thanks.  Kind regards   Paul;;;;;2016-08-14T09:21:15+0000;1471166475;2016-08-14 11:21:15;12;4;13;0;17;4;1;3;0;0;12;0;0;0;0;1;0

But I d also like to apologise for a) my daughter eating copious amounts of the fruit  and b) for my youngest that often chews a bit and throws it on your floor and whilst I do try my best to pick it all up in sure I miss bits. But more importantly I want to say thanks. Thanks to a young lady working in your Loughborough The Rushes store. A few weeks ago she served me and asked how I was  I explained that my youngest had just had a big operation and so we were all tired but relieved and just adjusting to life whilst she s in a big cast (being treated for hip Dysplasia so the cast is from her chest to both ankles). I left and thought she was kind and friendly but nothing else. However  this week whilst shopping again she happened to be serving us but I didn t even realise until she said  oh hi how lovely you ve brought your little one today how s she getting on with everything ? I was speechless. Instead of the usual stares and funny looks at her cast someone I didn t know was asking how she was! And she d remembered her and us as a family. I was really touched and it made me smile for the rest of the day. So thank you I have spoken to customer services at The Rushes store but I would equally appreciate you saying thank you/well done to the lady. I am determined to find her name and thank her personally too as I was so touched by her thoughtful comments at the time I completely forgot to check her name and say thank you.

I purchased a phone case that I later realised was the wrong size for my phone. I went straight back into the store with my receipt to return it. I was spoken to like I was stupid and didn t know anything. After being spoke down to and being told several times that they were refusing to refund me  they finally agreed to give me my money back. However  she made it seem like she was doing me a massive favour and that I should be extremely grateful. I will not be returning to this store if this is the way they treat their customers.;;;;;2016-08-13T20:30:35+0000;1471120235;2016-08-13 22:30:35;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I used your self service checkout no.72 and paid cash for my goods. I picked up my receipt and made my way to the exit. Your security guard stopped me on my way out and accused me of stealing over £100 of shopping. I was dragged through the store and treated atrociously by not only your security guards but your management too. None of them was willing to listen to me or check my goods against the receipt I had. I was publicly humiliated and was badgered by questioning of where I had hidden the stolen goods. I hadn t even left the store before your security had pulled me. I was detained by your staff for over 20mins before they realised that the person who had used the self service till before me was the one who had taken the goods without paying. I received no apology and was just told it s ok to leave now. I spend over £600 pound a month in your stores in Dumfries and Kirkcudbright. I can tell you now I have never been so embarrassed and humiliated in all my life. I certainly will never shop in your stores again.;;;;;2016-08-13T19:28:39+0000;1471116519;2016-08-13 21:28:39;11;43;34;9;86;40;29;11;10;0;11;0;11;0;0;12;0

I had possibly just experienced one of my worst shopping trips ever and her kindness and understanding was overwhelming and massively appreciated.   Earlier on in the day I had taken my little boy Archie to out of hours gp with a severe case of tonsillitis. Needless to say he was not in the mood or health for a shopping trip. However a last minute nappy emergency saw me bundling Archie and his younger sister in the car and headed to your Northwich store.   I have learnt over the last few months not to take both of my children food shopping with me. Archie is nearly 3 and his sister is 18 months old (a mere 15 months between them). They fight and scrap and generally play up together in a trolley at the best of times  leaving me feeling stressed and with only half of what I originally came shopping for.   So today was that but 100 x worse. Archie was inconsolably crying  Erin banged her head and wanted to be held whilst I tried to steer a trolley and throw the essential nappies and any other food I could think of to help soothe Archie s throat. So when I finally arrived at the till not only where both kids crying but so was I.   Leanne saw how I was struggling jumped straight up  unloaded all my shopping  packed it up and reloaded it again allowing  me to comfort the kids.  It meant so much to me and I hope this message can be passed on to her.   A very very grateful customer;;;;;2016-08-13T16:34:21+0000;1471106061;2016-08-13 18:34:21;19;7;24;1;32;7;6;1;2;0;19;5;0;0;0;0;0

When I booked another slot I forgot to amend the address before I checked out so I got a call from the delivery driver at 7.30 this morning asking where I was. Once we d established he was outside my old house he gave me the number of customer services to call to try and sort. I spoke to a lovely lady in customer services and she pleaded with your Crawley delivery centre to deliver to my new address (sadly they wouldn t  that is my only issue with today s service though). Anyway  she was lovely  she deleted my old address from my account so it didn t happen again. Anyway  a bit later on the delivery driver calls me back. He says he was just checking in on me  he said he d seen baby formula in my delivery and had I been able to sort a delivery for today and did I need the formula? I d already rebooked my delivery for tomorrow so was sorted but he didn t have to do that  he didn t have to make sure I was ok. He was lovely.

I am currently in your Leigh store (Manchester) to exchange some shoes..... I put them in a cupboard and basically forgot about them and they don t fit... They are outside the 30 days and so not requiring a refund.  I have my receipt but because one of the pairs (there are two) doesn t have the barcode label on it they won t exchange?  They are clearly not worn and still have the clip that holds them together... The lady on the til even readily admitted that they could have been sold to me without the label on them... Do I really now need to go home with shoes that don t fit and waste my money?

During the week  the regular staff are brilliant  the store is welcoming and customer service is excellent. At weekends it is a totally different story.  The weekend staff have no concept of customer service. This morning - and this is normal for a Saturday - the newspapers were in a complete shambles. I could not find The Times  then realised another gentleman was also looking for one. We eventually found them  under a pile of Daily Mails! We then realised there were no magazines in the paper. We discovered them in a pile  nowhere near The Times. How many people got home to find their paper incomplete I wonder.  I told the girl on the till the papers were in a mess  to which she replied  they didn t arrive in the right order . What on earth does that mean?  To add insult to injury the lottery machine is out of action for the second weekend in as many weeks. The reason  It has run out of paper and we are waiting for it to come in.  Unbelievable.

I went to the checkout to pay for a bottle of chambord and was challenged for ID which I provided. My sister who was accompanying me did not have ID despite being 30 years old. We were then refused sale because she did not have ID. When I asked to speak to the manager I was spoken to by a man called Scott  one of the Wishaw store managers and I was absoloutely appalled. We were told that we could have been a couple and that I looked much older than her (I am 5 years younger) so not only did the manager publicly insult me  his attitude towards us was a disgrace. He was snappy  abrupt  and completely rude to me and my sister. We felt so intimidated and were shocked at how poor the customer service was. I feel completely discriminated against because of my age  and I feel he would not have spoken to someone of an older age group in such a manner. I then had to purchase my products from a tesco extra which cost me more than it would have in the larger store! As the person who was buying the product  I had the correct identification and it should make no difference who is with me at the time. If I had children would they be asked for ID aswell?  I have been a customer of tesco for years and I now feel uncomfortable visiting the store again. I want to know what s going to be done about this ASAP  and I feel the manager is a disgrace to the store. I understand the law regarding the sale of alcohol however I have never been treated so poorly in a store in my life!

You cant just pop in and buy yourself a 500ml bottle of Coke. Nope  if your driving  you have to spend a minimum of £5.00. Even if you have just filled your van up with £50.00 of diesel  if you don`t spend at least £5.00 in store you get charged to park. I was in there less than 30 mins  and have received a £70.00 parking charge for the privilege. So  no more Tesco shopping for me. (usually spend around £130.00 per week on our main shop) Off to Morrisons it is from now on !!!!;;;;;2016-08-12T19:16:58+0000;1471029418;2016-08-12 21:16:58;0;5;0;0;5;5;1;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Nobody had contacted me  I spent over £150 on this one piece of furniture to finish of the collection of the rest of my bedroom furniture that I purchased from you! The only suggestion that would be made by the customer services advisor is that she could knock off the £6 delivery charge and rebook my delivery slot for over a week away!

Having recently moved  we have started using yourselves for our regular food shop; we had previously been Sainsbury s customers. We ve been pretty impressed so far  particularly as we re saving a bit of money. I popped in today to pick up some milk and purchased a Finest Sea Salt and Black Pepper Cob as I really fancied a crisp butty for my lunch (because I am an ADULT). However  I found the bread to be really  really dry - not even salvagable by extra butter - so I feel that my much anticipated lunch was a bit of a fail  which was disappointing as I d purchased the ~fancy~ bread especially. Is this bread always this way  was it a dodgy batch or are my expectations for the perfect crisp butty just too high?  Any help would be much appreciated. But  btw  totally not mad at you because your Cookie Crumble Icecreams are my new fave 😘";;;;;2016-08-12T16:09:32+0000;1471018172;2016-08-12 18:09:32;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have a 7 month old boy. And last week had to leave my child alone in his buggy in the carpark  while I reversed my car out enough to be able to open the door to get him in! Obviously this has massive risks  someone could have took him  or the breaks on his buggy could have failed  and he could have rolled into my car  or someone else could have hit him! I was livid  but I really had no other choice. I made sure I could see him at all times  but my point is why do you no longer do parent and toddler car stickers? And why do you not have people patrolling the car park? I have asked people without chldren before  why are they parking there  to be met with a barrage of abuse. If the situation is not rectified soon I will start shopping elsewhere. I have complained to the staff today  who said they would pass my concerns onto the manager.

Twice in the last few weeks we have brought my disabled mother to your store at Great Notley Braintree and twice we have had to come away empty handed! Both times the wheelchair has been unavailable first time  in use second time broken. Now as a fair sized store I would expect at least 2 to be available so if one breaks you have a spare. The store up the road in Dunmow has 5 and at least one of those is electric. We have no room to bring mums own wheelchair and then fill the car with groceries. We pay for mum to be taken out by carers and mileage costs add up  Notley is our regular store and the one she wants to use but is now considering heading to Sainsburys!

I would have thought with your recent profit loss due to greed you would not try and take even more money from your customers  you already have the dearest fuel out of all 4 main supermarkets. Because of your £2 greed charge  i decided not to order these items and will just go to Asda and purchase from the store.;;;;;2016-08-12T07:24:27+0000;1470986667;2016-08-12 09:24:27;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My daughter age 9 was very interested to use this as shes too big for the baby seat and some staff have said its unsafe to have her in the trolly where u put the food.Would I be allowed to use it with my adhd daughter or is it for other types of disabilities? The reason I ask on here is to avoid confrontations from staff. Shopping is extremely stressful but have found the scan as u shop helpful to keep my daughter from running off and getting stressed.

I just wanted to bring to your attention some of the amazing fundraising work your management and staff in Tesco extra Alloa have been involved in.

Without a second thought  Laura approached her store manager and enlisted the help of fellow colleagues Ryan Hartley  Ronnie Beresford and Leeann Cox to help! They have already raised a lot of money with a sponsored silence  an in house bake sale  a bag pack  a football match against our local Adsa (Tesco won by the way⚽️🏆) where they sold snacks  support bands and tombola and this weekend they have organised a sell out X Factor night that it sure to be a massive success!   Not only have this group of organisers committed their personal time and efforts  as well as some of their own money into making these events as successful as possible  they have been supported by the rest of the store staff and management who have donated money  bought cakes  attended or played at the football match and are performing/judging/voting at the xfactor on Saturday! The dedication of all the staff at the Tesco extra Alloa store has been admiral and so appreciated by the family concerned and they are an absolute credit to your company!;;;;;2016-08-11T18:58:56+0000;1470941936;2016-08-11 20:58:56;5;0;5;2;7;0;0;0;0;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was doing my normal lunch time/break shop to Woodford Green Express in East London and I was looking through the reduce section. There was a number of vegetable dishes in the section which was not priced.  i took a few items to the till only to be informed that they was not reduced. When I spoke to the manager about the reason on why these items were being placed in this section if they was not reduced  he informed that they are there till 3pm in the day when at this time they would reduce them! i questioned this as false advertising of cost and the manager informed that head office has instructed all Express stores to do this!  So just to clarify   all items due to be reduced that day needs to be put into an open section for everyone to view and then customers will have to wait till 3pm to be able to buy these at a reduce rate? Surely this is not the correct way for the Express store to work?  I will be doing my lunch time shopping in Waitrose from now on  where i can relay on honest pricing!;;;;;2016-08-11T11:55:57+0000;1470916557;2016-08-11 13:55:57;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My 3 year old climbed on the side of my trolley causing it to tip over and fall on her- completely her fault.  She fell and banged her head hard on the ground.  One of your amazing Employees caught the trolley which prevented my 1 year old inside the trolley from also hitting her head on the floor! Amazing! I went to comfort my 3 year old and another member of staff was straight over and got a first aider to check her over. I of course was in shock and started crying. After getting the all clear from the first aider I finished my shopping to then be presented with a lovely bunch of flowers at the checkout!

You have all this space  and all this opportunity  yet you still decide that the baby changing room can be a baby feeding room too.  An uncomfortable chair plonked next to a toilet  in a room with a bin full of nappies is not the right place to feed a baby.  Would you really take your lunch and sit on that chair next to that toilet  smelling those nappies?  Go on  try it  I dare you! Now imagine that you want a nice relaxed lunch  so that you can take your time over your yummy sandwiches  but someone else desperately needs to change a poosplosion (this involves carefully peeling all clothing off a baby  and wondering how on earth so much poo came from such a small person).  You could either rush your lunch  or let the poo in while you finish your lunch off.  Fancy it?  No  nor would a baby  or a mother trying to feed a baby. Please please please stop labelling toilets as appropriate feeding rooms.  There s a cafe upstairs.  Pop a sign up saying  Please feel free to feed in our cafe.  No need to buy any food or drink .  Or consult some real mothers and ask them what they would like in a baby feeding room (Hint: no toilets  a comfy chair or two  and a few toys for the older sibling).  And above all  please keep it seperate from the changing room  as poo and food really do not go well together. You re not alone in doing this  but you can be the one to make the change and show everyone else how to do it right. Go on  pretty please.;;;;;2016-08-10T22:13:51+0000;1470867231;2016-08-11 00:13:51;36;8;38;2;48;7;4;3;4;0;36;2;0;0;0;0;0

So we order online every week without fail and don t get me wrong I do love the service but I have a few minor issues. But first let s set the scene we are two working adults with no car and it would cost us a tenner every time we want to get a bus to the nearest supermarket for shopping. We rent a small flat without a freezer....problem number one.  We are trying to be economical  cut down on waste and we plan our meals.  Our delivery we order every Monday and costs us £4. If we don t spend 40 a week it costs us another 4 quid....so we now are forced to spend 40 a week just to justify the cost. That s alot for two of us...plus cat. In addition the food we get is not always fresh.  Take for example today is Wednesday our food arrived on Monday  Chicken for two meals  then mince for today tomorrow.  Can t freeze remember.  Open the mince it s OK for today but won t be good for tomz.  So 2mz dinner in the bin and we will have to get a ready meal from the newsagents on the way home. Again delivery on Monday but by Friday their is no way we can get fresh to last us the weeknd. So we still have to go out and get more food. Our monthly shop is now 200 quid a month minimum....quite a lot for two adults......it s not ideal and it s frustrating and I m fed up of not ever getting fresh enough meat to last the week.....grumble over.;;;;;2016-08-10T17:57:37+0000;1470851857;2016-08-10 19:57:37;0;11;0;0;11;11;9;2;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I placed an order for some sites w for my girls and one pair didn t fit so now I m forced to re order and pay the charge for 1 pair of £ 5 shoes!  Really bit happy at all.  Also why have you changed the invoice that comes with the order?  There s no prices on them and the assistant was really frustrated and had to ask me to see my original order via my phone!

Unbeknowing to me  as my puppy lay under my chair  she was stripping long lengths of the tennis ball covering and swallowing it whole.  She was very ill yesterday until she was sick last night.  I am hoping there is no more left in her stomach as I have just found out that if this is left in the stomach for more than 24 hours it can result in death.  As she is not eating yet  my vets has advised me to visit them were surgery may be on the cards.  I would like to know if you are still selling this item and what safety check do you go through before stocking them in your stores.

As we reached the top of the escalator near the store entrance I noticed an elderly gentleman approach the security guard with his trolley. As my dad stopped to reach his shopping list out of his pocket  I looked back to the elderly man chatting to the security guard. It was pretty evident from hand gestures that he was asking the security guard if he could take the trolley out to the front of the store where his car was parked less about than a metre away so he could unload his shopping. I could also see the security guard was telling him he couldn t. The security guard began pointing down the escalator suggesting that the elderly man could move his car to the underground car park and then bring his shopping down in his trolley. This was when I started to get angry as this was a very elderly gentleman who obviously struggled as not only did he have a walking stick but was also visibly shaking. I can only assume the gentleman said he didn t really want to do this as this was the point the security guard started to remove the bags from his trolley. My dad was just about to go over to help so I told him  no  its fine  the security guard is helping him . I could not believe my eyes when the security guard proceeded to load the elderly gentleman with the bags and it was immediately evident the elderly man was struggling. My dad then ran over to take the bags off of the gentleman before any more could be handed over and help him take them to his car which was literally parked right outside the store entrance. Now I understand that a security guard may not be able to leave his post  but surely there would have been someone in the store he could have called over to assist in a more appropriate fashion. I am assuming the customer care part of the job description would surely cover a small act of common human decency such as this?! I dread to think what could have happened if my dad had not gone over to help him and he instead had attempted this on his own  unaided by his walking stick as he was obviously naturally unsteady on his feet without the numerous shopping bags your security card kindly loaded him with. My main aim of this is just to understand whether this is common practise in matters such as this which I sincerely hope it isn t as I can assure you  it will be the last time myself or my dad shop at Tescos;;;;;2016-08-10T16:20:27+0000;1470846027;2016-08-10 18:20:27;2;12;4;0;16;12;5;7;7;0;2;0;1;0;0;1;0

I couldn t get to sleep and I can t focus on anything else. I messed up last night. Bad.   I went to get my 18 month old cat  Penny  some delicious wet food from Tesco last night. Her favourite is Rabbit and now that we no longer own Rabbits  she s allowed to eat it again.   So my wife and I spent at least 10 minutes checking EVERY SINGLE PACK of wet food in the huge Reading Tesco aisle. Finally  we find some Sheba Wet food. 50p each or 8 for £3 - essentially buy 6  get 2 free.   What happened next mortifies me. Please stop reading here if you re of a sensitive disposition.  In my haste to exit the store  I collected what I believed to be 8 packs of the delicious Sheba Wet food. However  when I got home to feed young Penny  I saw there were only 7. That s right  7  packs of tasty  refined rabbit. 1 less than the required amount to trigger the 8 for £3 deal.   I scrambled urgently to find the receipt and confirm my suspicions. I was right. Instead of spending £3 on Penny s dinner and breakfast for the next four days  I had spent £3.50 for only 3 and a half days.   Not only am I now 50p poorer than I should be  Penny will now have to skip a meal.   Never in my life have I felt so much shame. I ve let Penny down  I ve let my wife down  I ve let Myself down and most importantly  I ve let my British Money-saving pride down.   Please  when shopping at Tesco do not repeat my mistakes. Be wary.;;;;;2016-08-10T12:14:20+0000;1470831260;2016-08-10 14:14:20;1;15;6;1;22;15;2;13;12;0;1;0;0;5;0;0;0

As I went to to my local Tescos in Oxford and parked in the disabled spaces as I am eligible and watched a car pull up with a man  woman and baby  they had not even drove over to parent and child parking where there spaces. I got out and told them it was disabled parking of which they ignored me so I said I would report them in the store then. When going into the store there was another lovely sports car with a young lad sat waiting with his window down  no disabled badge so I said politely  you do know you are parked in a disabled space and shouldn t be   so he said  Id better move then . when getting in the store I asked a young assistant in a suit  who was responsible for watching people don t park in the disabled spaces?  as there were cars right now parked there and there always are every time I visit and he said the security team. So he had a word and they were both moved but another seven seater in its place! They should give tickets and points on the licence to deter this  hit people financially  they might think twice!

I have just had my car washed at the Hand Car Wash at your Wokingham store. Before i handed over my key I specifically pointed out an area of paint damage on the bonnet and asked them to be careful/avoid it if possible.   On returning to the car this damage is now significantly worse. The staff were rude (language was a huge barrier) and insisted there was nothing they could ve done as it was water damage. This area has been subject to rain and shine for over a year and had stayed as it was.   I was told there was no one to speak to as the manager was on holiday.

She is a pensioner and on the 29 July had care of her disabled adult son  Mr F who lives in a specialist residential home in Northamptonshire. On the 29 July at 15.11h Mrs F had attempted to park her car in a disabled parking bay outside Tesco Express on Wanstead High Street so that she could push her son in his wheelchair to choose some food for dinner. Mrs A and her son were verbally attacked by one of your staff for legaly parking in a disabled space outside of the store. Your driver  an eastern european man was driving delivery lorry  Mercedes KM61 RXX. He shouted at her and her son that he had been waiting to use the  disabled  space for twenty minutes to make a delivery and she had better move out if his way or he would move her car with his truck! She got out of her car and showed him her son s blue badge  he completely disregarded this and continued to verbally abuse her and her son with increasing anger. Your employees threatening behaviour forced Mrs F to flee the space in fear for hers and her son s safety. Mrs F saw a traffic enforcement officer as she drove away from outside the store. She stopped her car to tell the enforcement officer what had happened in the disabled space outside of the tesco store. He told her he could not do anything about the incident Mrs F and her son had experienced but that he would certainly go and give your lorry a parking ticket. This man will remember Mrs F. Mrs F then drove off to find an appropriate place to park so where she would be able to push her son in his wheelchair and buy some food  they went into the bakery on the high street where the member of staff is also likely to remember her and her son due to their distress. Mrs A took her phone out during the incident intending to take a photo of the registration number of the lorry so that she could report your driver  fortunately she accidentally took a short video in which she can be heard very upset  telling your driver she will not argue with him but she will report him to Tesco. I am not able to attach the video but have attached a still from it to this message. I will retain the video for your viewing should this be required.  Mr F was born with a chromosonal condition called Trisomy 13  this means he has a severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of his body. Mr F also has heart defects  brain and spinal cord abnormalities  poorly developed eyes and extremely weak muscle tone. Mr F also has Type 1 diabetes and is partially sighted and hearing impaired. Mr F has been left traumatised by the behaviour of your employee and due to his conditions he cannot make sense of what happened to him and his mum.He is 39y of age and has a mental age of 8y.  I am extremely upset by the completely inappropriate behaviour of one of your employees and upset by the hugely detrimental impact this has had on my friend and her extremely vulnerable son.  To add to the distress  Mrs A has subsequently received a penalty charge notice for stopping in a bus lane 4 minutes after this incident as she spotted a Parking Enforcement Officer and stopped to explain to him what had happened. This fine is £55 increasing to £165 in 28 days. I have challenged this on her behalf on the basis of her predisposition following the attack by your driver! How many more vulnerable people has he abused?  An apology from the driver and TESCO is the least we expect for Mrs A and her son Mr F.;;;;;2016-08-10T09:42:00+0000;1470822120;2016-08-10 11:42:00;2;9;3;0;12;9;6;3;5;0;2;0;1;0;0;0;0

It was my first time  clicking and collecting  and the moment is one I will never forget!  I was nervous to begin  but was eased through the process gently as a first timer should be  and my overall experience was one I will never forget! I was hesitant at first and even went to the wrong location. Bi-product of nerves I suppose  but the person who directed me to where I had to go to collect my groceries was really helpful and even took my empty trolley from me that I collected through habit! I made my way to the click and collect area and the chap was very happy to hold my hand through this life changing process  explained about the  substitutions  and helped me to load my stuff into the car despite me being the last customer of the day! He was very friendly and offered a lot of encouragement.  After getting back in my car  I felt a big sigh of relief knowing that the 3 mins I had spent there will forever change my life for the better. I found myself telling everyone about it to the point people were asking why I was so excited. It just felt good for my first time and know I ll come back for more!  I love you Mr Tesco!

Unfortunately he had gone into the store by the time I got out but I have his registration number and pic of his car if you want to do anything.

Being lactose intolerant this has enabled me to enjoy summer  such as it is in the UK  along with the rest of the family. That is until this evening. After dinner my loving husband (shhhhhhhhh don t ruin his street cred at work) went to the freezer and kindly passed me one of my favourite treats. Unfortunately  there were a lot of water crystals and a soggy wafer cone. Now  we use your wonderful home delivery service and when the frozen food is received it is indeed frozen  which leads me to the horrifying thought that this thaw and refreeze must have happen prior to being loaded onto the delivery van.

After finally securing my 10mth old son in the trolley I entered the store to b met with some form of alarm going off  as the security were not stopping anyone entering we assumed it must be a drill and went to start our shopping. I was approached shortly after entering by a female member of staff to say it s not a drill and we r evacuating. She asked me to empty my trolley and then leave!?!?! I only had some birthday cards so thankfully it didn t take long 😡 I followed the general stream of staff as no one was instructing us where to go for the fire assembly point. I stood amongst some staff in a huddle and noticed they took the time to check Facebook  take selfies and have a cigarette! I was furious as my baby was next to them at this point! A staff member pointed out we weren t even half way to the official meeting point!!!! But the shoppers were left outside the main store door! So dangerous 😡 what a shambles! Clearly this store don t care whether their customers r burnt???? Poor manners  bad conduct and atrocious safety knowledge.

Once again there are loads of empty shelves. Once again a promotion is running and surprise  surprise - only one part of the two part promotion is instore. The usual place for the promotion has been filled with other similar items on promotion (but NOT the item that was originally there.) They turned up hidden further into the store on the top shelf towards the end of the aisle. The promotion was clearly printed on the box  but there was no sign of the second item. Thinking that a staff member may have  hidden  them somewhere else entirely we searched the store. Finally giving up looking we went and asked a member of staff for help. She was very helpful and took us straight to where they should have been (which is exactly where we had first looked). She was surprised to see that they were no longer there  so went and found a member of staff who she said could give us more information.  When he appeared he tried to tell us that they had NEVER sold the second item in that store. When I pointed out that I had bought it there a number of times in the past he tried to back-track and say that they only get it in very infrequently.  It comes in for a little while and goes again.  I told him that that was NOT the case as I had seen it there almost permanently over the last year or so. He then looked really sheepish and said that they don t have it and it only came in for a part of the promotion  it sold out and that they aren t going to be selling it again. I told him that it was wrong to be selling the other item with the promotion printed on it if they had no intention of fulfilling the offer. He said that they were only a small store and that if we wanted the offer we needed to go to the bigger ones. When asked again about why they were selling only one half of a promotion (and that being the item with the offer printed on it) he said that  Tesco buy everything in bulk  so we may end up with items that have offers on them that we don t do here.  I told him that y couldn t do that as it was false advertising and as such it is illegal to do so. I also pointed out that it wasn t the first time that this particular store has had empty shelves when a promotion is on. We have been in quite a few times in the past and found this to be the case. It is amazing how the shelves are  magically  full once again the very first day after the promotion has ended. This cannot be a coincidence so many times.  As we went through the checkout a different member of staff confirmed that she too had bought the item a number of times from there so how can the store claim that they had NEVER sold it?!!!  SHAME ON YOU TESCO STORE IN BARRY  SOUTH WALES!!!  I think that I should go back to shopping at Morrisons or Asda  as I still have to go there to get the rest of my shopping tomorrow due to so many items not being available today.;;;;;2016-08-09T19:38:36+0000;1470771516;2016-08-09 21:38:36;0;4;1;0;5;4;1;3;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0

Only after I made eye contact with her for a few monents did she offer a weak  sorry  with a somewhat patronizing facial expression as she passed me. I m mostly annoyed about this for two reasons - firstly my 9 week old daughter was in her car seat in the trolley and secondly half of the aisle was taken up by 2 other members of your staff  both teenagers  flirting outrageously whilst discussing their driving passing tests. My daughter was in a specially adapted trolley where you put the car seat on top.

When he arrived with her shopping  she was desperately ill and incoherent. He made sure she was okay and that my dad was on his way back home to her  and then as she was too unwell to do it for herself  he went massively above and beyond and unpacked all her frozen and refrigerated goods and put them away for her so they didn t spoil. I want him to get the recognition he deserves for not only doing his job fantastically well  but also for being a lovely human being. We are very grateful to him for what he did today.;;;;;2016-08-09T16:57:09+0000;1470761829;2016-08-09 18:57:09;23985;512;25484;1276;27272;499;456;43;432;0;23748;1321;150;4;2;1;0

This has left me and many others extremely disappointed. Why do profit making groups get priority over a non for profit group ran entirely by volunteers? The cloth nappy library is a huge help to those locally as not only does nic provide support and advice to those using cloth but she also lends out long term nappy kits to those who simply can t afford nappies and would have to chose between food or nappies for their children. How can you call a community room as such when the community isn t the most important factor in who uses it? Having been to the group weekly not once did the lady who organises the room come to meet us and ask how the group supported families  she didn t see how any passing family were welcome wether they used cloth nappies or not in order to let their kids play and chat to other mums. This in itself is lovely for local mums as some mothers at home are so starved of adult company they often pop up tescos just to get out of the house. However when attending another local group (profit making) I saw the lady who runs the room everytime and she was all over the companies who used the room. I am so disappointed in the situation. Maybe you should remember that community doesn t mean profits!!;;;;;2016-08-09T16:10:27+0000;1470759027;2016-08-09 18:10:27;2;2;2;0;4;2;1;1;2;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Ordering school clothes online was easy but delivery was terrible. Most of my order was missing. Tesco rearranged items to be sent ASAP (thank you tesco) Missing items were then received with extra trousers that I d already received (rang back to be told that I could keep them for inconvenience caused by the screw up) kept receiving 2 items I hadn t ordered for me to realise yesterday after receiving a delivery it was because they shared the same order number with the item I ordered.  Again rang back to explain why you kept sending me wrong items and what could I do with them (told me to take back to store for refund). Got woken up this morning by a delivery driver with original missing items. Rang tesco yet again as you was waiting for jumpers to come back into stock to send to me and these came this morning. Spoke to a rude person who told me under no certain terms I had to return all duplicate items to a tesco store ASAP other wise you would charge me for the extra you sent including the trousers I had been told I could keep. I ordered online as it was an easier option with 3 young kids (one with severe learning and behaviour disabilities) it s not my fault that hermes screwed up my order. It would of been easier for me to take all 3 kids in store to buy the clothes in the first place and put up with my son s meltdowns in store as I now have to go there anyway with them but this time they will have to wait patiently (not going to happen) in a line at customer services and then wait quietly (really not going to happen) for me to explain this whole mess to the staff at customers service ............

I understand that no business is a fan of something for nothing and a loyalty scheme for customers must really hit a raw nerve but it s certainly evident over the last couple of years that club card points  of which we choose to collect at Christmas have deminished considerably even though our shopping habits haven t really changed a huge amount. This is even taking into account of the fact that we no longer receive vouchers  only extra points.  Could you explain to me why I get the feeling that I m being completely shafted for being a loyal customer?  Many thanks;;;;;2016-08-09T04:27:28+0000;1470716848;2016-08-09 06:27:28;2;3;2;0;5;3;1;2;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I purchased some of your own brand odourless cat litter the other day. Your packaging RAVES about itself.   After 2 days of use I can categorically say it is the most horrendous smelling thing I have ever purchased. If anything  it smells even worse than what cats actually do in it.   Don t get me wrong I know cat poo stinks right  but I also know what it smells like.... but somehow  hideously  as soon as it hits this litter it s smell becomes something entirely different.   Different is an understatement in fact  as it became something I would only expect to experience if I had to enter the seven circles of hell. I literally nearly dropped dead on the spot  my brain nearly haemorrhaged when I just opened the kitchen door and was hit by its  odourless  odour.   Anyway  just FYI  because somebody high up needs to know to check their staff can smell before they employ them to test odourless products in future.   Other than that  I bought a lovely onion to make a pasta bake the other night. Very rich in flavour.  Have a good night.;;;;;2016-08-08T20:39:02+0000;1470688742;2016-08-08 22:39:02;3;2;3;0;5;2;2;0;0;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have to say it a fair bit of a change in terms of stores. I feel Skegness is a bit smaller and lacks a few of what I think are essentials  however the joe bloggs of Skegness may not appreciate my necessities.   Definitely been wondering where the lack of scan and shop is in the store as well. My wife has been left with an extra free hand to add more unnecessary things to the trolley. Costing me a small fortune.  However in my 3 weeks of going to your Skegness store on a Monday night I have found some joy from the lack of scan and shop. That joy was in the form of Joshua on the tills. Been to his till twice and he was very enthusiastic and chatted to me about different things. Even when I needed bags he gave me the correct amount I needed for my shop. All in all fantastic. Joyous service and efficient all in one. The one thing I didn t realise was that he has only been there 3 weeks.   So my plea to you tesco is look after this young gent. He is an excellent example of what your staff can be and I just hope he continues to enjoy his job and deliver joy as well as good shopping. Please don t let him be another little drone and beat the personality out of him. Look after his little spark.  Pretty much I had an alright time chatting to your guy at the till and he seems like a good guy in your organisation.;;;;;2016-08-08T19:45:57+0000;1470685557;2016-08-08 21:45:57;3;3;5;0;8;3;1;2;1;0;3;2;0;0;0;0;0

My 7 month old daughter was violently sick whilst we were doing the shopping today and Susan came to our rescue with wipes and clothing. Susan also assisted me with my shopping by holding my daughter and helped me to my car. Susan deserves recognition for all her help during a very stressful time and I very much appreciate it.

Self scanned my shop through and noticed one of the make-up items had gone through at a higher price than I d expected.

She also identified through our conversation that we had inadvertently dropped a mascara through the trolley on our rounds as someone had recently returned it to her to be put back on the shelf...saving me the upset of the  tween  it was purchased for!!! Well done Tesco Hardwick  couldn t ask for better service. 😊 (If you can identify the lady she had dark hair in a bun and was in smart work wear not Tesco uniform)  the lady who processed the refund was also very helpful!

I recently placed an order for the Tesco Easy Entertaining range for a special party we were having on Saturday 6th Aug.  They ask that you give 3/4 days notice  more on some items when placing the order. I assumed that this was so they could ensure they had sufficient time to prepare my food.  Unfortunately  I was wrong. I received an email Fri evening  my delivery was booked for between 10pm and 11pm  to advise me that the mini classic cupcakes I d ordered were unavailable.  I spoke to customer service who said he would contact the dot com manager in the store who would ring me back.  He didn t  but the c/s advisor did to let me know there was a supplier issue and that I hadn t been charged. Really! I certainly would not expect to pay for something you couldn t supply.  My delivery arrived early and the driver was lovely  the only positive thing about this whole experience  but when checking my order we found that not only were the 36 classic cupcakes missing but so were 36 mini cupcakes and 60 mini savoury eggs. The driver was very apologetic  he knew nothing about the shortages  even though they are supposed to be advised.  Once again I had to ring customer service to complain. The girl I spoke to found it hard to believe there were no substitutes at all for the mini savoury eggs. I know I d ordered the value range but surely supplying the next price range up would have provided better customer service than sending nothing at all!  Saturday morning was spent trying to source 72 mini cupcakes and 60 mini savoury eggs  something that I had expected to prevent by ordering from the Easy Entertaining range.  Having successfully found the necessary items in Asda  I returned home to receive a phone call from my local Tesco to tell me the cupcakes had come in on the delivery that morning and were available if I wanted them. I told her  very politely  that I d had to get them elsewhere and that I wouldn t be using or recommending that service to anyone  ANYONE CONSIDERING ORDERING FROM THE EASY ENTERTAINING RANGE PLEASE BE AWARE THAT EVEN IF YOU PROVIDE TESCO WITH THE REQUIRED NOTICE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE YOU WILL RECEIVE YOUR ORDER!!!!!;;;;;2016-08-08T09:36:38+0000;1470648998;2016-08-08 11:36:38;1;2;1;0;3;2;2;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

What a humiliating experience!

Our Microwave from Tesco s caught fire when I say caught fire I mean flames/smoke and the most awful smell ever  it required a fire blanket etc to put out the flames..  But this could have been a much different post as my little boy was in the kitchen at the time..  I decided was gonna take my barely used microwave back to the store (Oak Tree Lane  mansfield) I had the but could I heck as like find the receipt  I have every receipt back to 2010 lol) Once in-store I explained the situation to Mel (Tech) he told me not to worry as customer service could track the transaction my club card history.. and phoned them for me-i explained the situation to customer service although they were helpful they said it would take up to two weeks to track the transaction.. I was a bit miffed but ok with this as I really just wanted Tesco to be aware there was an issue with this microwave.. especially given the fact it had also scorched my worktop on a 30 second bottle warm.  However Mel wasn t.. he looked over the microwave and was shocked/almost 4 days later the smell in-store was toxic from the microwave.  He said he was going to get the store manager and show him.. again the manager was shocked..  Mel said there was no way this should have happened and that if there was anything that could be done he d find it..  During my time in-store he listened.. was polite/knowledgeable and curtious and a true gentleman.  He understood that I d been uncomfortable about taking the item back but reassured me I d done the right thing..  In the end I did get a full refund on my microwave but opted to do some research before purchasing another microwave.  I think alot of staff and other stores learn alot from this guy..  Fabulous customer service!!  P.s. I have tried numerous times to write this review your website using the correct methods but It won t work/save???;;;;;2016-08-08T06:52:17+0000;1470639137;2016-08-08 08:52:17;2;0;2;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

My phone suddenly broke and I was in need of a new one due to my husband having poor health  it was around 9pm and the phone department had closed at 8pm  daniel went out of his way to see if I was able to buy a phone which resulted in him phoning an off duty colleague for the code and accessing the keys. I was then able to purchase my phone and Daniel set it all up for me to ensure it worked with my sim before i left   so thanks once again Daniel  your a real gem! 😁 tesco should be proud to have you as part of the team;;;;;2016-08-07T22:19:47+0000;1470608387;2016-08-08 00:19:47;16;2;16;0;18;2;2;0;5;0;15;0;0;0;0;0;0

I find it unbelievable that a big company like yours doesn t comply with RSPCA and Rabbit welfare association guidelines. Rabbits are the single most abused pet in the uk  and you are simply perpetuating this by selling cruel housing. Complying with the rabbit association guidelines for housing (RWAF) would do a lot for your standing in the responsible pet owners community. RWAF has named and shamed you this morning for selling cruel housing. As a big retailer you should be setting a good example.

For one I applaud you for allowing long passwords but why enforce using upper  lower  number  and special character. This does nothing in terms of security  its all about length (tell your security team to read about password entropy) and they will soon realise that having random characters does not make a difference!  Not only that  the reset password is only allowed if you have 3 of the following and not all four! Crazy!.  Plus once ive gotten a very weird password which I know ill never remember (I will just have to reset again) it says im not entering a valid postcode! So unable to proceed.   Unfortuantely because of this im unable to log in and wont be making a delievery order which is really dissapointing.  Hopefully you can pass this onto the web team so they can fix the bug pronto.

When we arrived  the Tesco delivery van was sitting waiting for us  a couple of minutes early as he had just delivered somewhere else on this street.   There are no polite words to describe the facetious neighbour who was harassing the delivery driver. He was out in arms complaining to all who would listen about how the delivery driver dared park almost in front of his drive (although he wasn t going anywhere) and how the almost silent sound from the van  that was keeping our goods chilled  dared ruin five minutes of his evening.  I am writing to you as i know that the neighbour took photos to write you a strongly worded letter of complaint  you may as well return to sender as this driver was polite  courteous and gave great service that didn t deserve any of the harassment he was receiving.

Unfortunately organisation is not a good word to describe Tesco.

She didn t  we chased  she called to say the store would call  they haven t  we chased  have been told that the driver is probably  out of time   would have to go back to Penzance  reload the vans and someone else bring it out   ETA  who knows? .

I was shopping in the Yeovil store this morning using the scan and shop system. When I got to the scan and shop check out at roughly 10am the system told me that my shopping had been selected to be checked. Fine  no problem  or so I thought! The operator came over scanner in hand to check my shopping  she scanned a few items  then said she needed to check her scanner as something hadn t scanned  no problem  the operator came back and scanned again  then said that there was a problem and asked me to move my trolley over. The operator then said that she was going to have to scan the entire shop  didn t explain why  no problem  I thought. When unpacking my shop  I noticed that a tray of potatoes had split  I asked if I could change them and was told  go and find them yourself  so I did. When I returned to the scan and shop checkout  the operator was stood with another colleague and they were both looking at me very oddly. The operator who had checked my shop  then announced in a VERY loud voice that I had over £27 of shopping that had not scanned. The operator then turned to her colleague and said again very loudly  What happens now? Do I need to call security?  I was absolutely mortified. I had no idea how this had happened. I tried to explain that I scanned every single item  however this was sniffed at. When I suggested the possibility that the scanner I had used might be faulty  I was told that this couldn t possibly be the case as the operator was using my scanner. This actually wasn t the case as she had arrived with the scanner in her hand. I tried to point this out but again was cried down and made to feel like I was a criminal. It was awful  so embarrassing with other shoppers staring. I have no idea what happened with my shopping  it has never happened before and will never happen again as I will never be returning to shop at Tesco again. I have cut up my club card. It was an absolutely hideous experience. To add insult to injury  when I returned home and unpacked my shopping  the operator had obviously dropped a large tub of yoghurt whilst repacking it when I had gone to get find the tray of potatoes because the bottom had split and yoghurt had gone all over the rest of my shopping in the bag.;;;;;2016-08-06T17:32:55+0000;1470504775;2016-08-06 19:32:55;0;13;0;3;16;7;2;5;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I never usually take him because he hates shopping and sitting in the trolley but had no choice today. Before we had  even walked in to Tesco he decided to throw a temper tantrum I then succeeded in getting him into the trolley and started shopping walking past the free fruit for children (brilliant idea). My son almost fell out the trolley in his temper even though I had strapped him in he had pulled himself free. He then wanted mummy cuddles and when I tried to put him down again to walk he just wanted to get back up. I was almost in tears by this point and about to give up shopping all together go home and go hungry (no food in the house) it was so busy being a Saturday and lots of shoppers had walked past watching me struggle. Then Steph came to my recuse she had been handing out the free fruit and witnessed everything she dropped what she was doing and pushed my trolley around the store for me so that I could carry my son  she spoke to him and claimed him down and entertained him while we walked round. She even offered to put my shopping on the till and pack it for me by this point my son had calmed down and become his usual playful self. Steph went above and beyond and this one small act of kindness had such an impact on our day  I can t express how much I appreciated her help  Tesco you have an amazing employee. Thank you Steph;;;;;2016-08-06T12:06:33+0000;1470485193;2016-08-06 14:06:33;3;1;3;0;4;1;1;0;0;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

I cannot drive due to the vast amount of meds I have to take  in the last 6 weeks i have been let down  lied to  and brushed off 5 out of 6 times!! Thats an 83% failure rate!! I ordered my shopping to be delivered last night between 10-11pm  its gets to 11:10pm  I try to ring to ask where my shopping is  Conveniently the lines shut at 11pm so no joy there. I ring at the earliest opportunity this morning to be told I was contacted yesterday to notify me of a problem and a message was left   THIS IS A LIE !! then a very unfriendly and unhelpful Angela (MA10 is her ID code I believe) tells me that the best she is willing to do is reschedule for tomorrow lunchtime. Should I starve until then as I cannot drive to any shops? Should I be a PRIORITY as it was YOU who FAILED yet again? Its bad enough having your life turned upside down  spending 6 months in hospital  being in a coma for 2 of the 6 months  enduring chemo and radio therapy  but talk about being kicked while you are down !! I previously shopped at the Culverhouse cross store and was always extremely happy with the service  especially a few key people helping me with shopping and getting to and from my car when I could drive (Mel from scan and shop deserves a mention) but was unable to walk. Your level of service has spiralled downwards !! I was under the impression your slogan is  Every little helps  ? My question is ...HOW ARE YOU HELPING A LOYAL CUSTOMER BY LEAVING THEM TO STARVE KNOWING THEY CANNOT SHOP WITHOUT YOUR DELIVERY SERVICE?? IS THAT THE LITTLE BIT THATS HELPING ME ? I THINK NOT !!. I look forward to your response and how you intend to rectify this issue knowing you and your staff are happily kicking someone while they are down!  P.s. it says on my online orders that you have delivered my shopping !!! PRICELESS !!!;;;;;2016-08-06T11:28:50+0000;1470482930;2016-08-06 13:28:50;0;3;2;1;6;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;1;0

After a late(ish) night  no alcohol involved  not a very good sleep then an early rise to drop eldest child off at his Uncle s in Falkirk I decided to do my weekly shop whilst I was out and about. One takeaway coffee in my hand and I find myself in the vegetable aisle staring at the produce. A lovely member of staff approached me (apologies  didn t get her name - still half asleep) and asked me if I was okay before offering to do my shopping for me.  Bless her. Giving myself a shake I declined her kind offer. Further round the store I couldn t find an item I was looking for and your Australian/NZ colleague (sorry  don t know her name either) came to my rescue having had less sleep than I had (we had a blether).  Eventually deciding I had finished my shopping I was served by Chris at the checkout and his usual chatty  friendly manner finally woke me up :-) The point of this post I hear you ask....well  I just want to highlight how helpful and friendly the staff at the store are.

We went to self scan and one of the colleagues come to confirm my age for the wine. She asked what it was we had that needed confirming  I replied with it being just the wine and showed her the bottle to which she shouted  NO  at me after looking me up and down. Pretty confused and shocked I replied with that I have my ID and went rummaging into my bag for my purse  pretty embarrassed as the woman had shouted it so loud it had brought attention from other shoppers. Before I could get my ID out she pressed confirm and walked away muttering something to herself that I couldn t hear.  I work in a Sainsburys myself and I m fully aware of the think 25 policy that most supermarkets hold. Despite the sheer rudeness from the member of staff I found it more shocking that she didn t physically take my ID to look at after causing such a scene. I m 20 years old and I think I look quite young for my age  and obviously being 20 I qualify to be asked for ID under the think 25 policy so it s quite worrying thinking that things like this are happening in this store!;;;;;2016-08-05T22:17:15+0000;1470435435;2016-08-06 00:17:15;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Unfortunately  I didn t get her name but I believe she was a checkout supervisor. I was visiting the store with my 9 week old daughter and she was getting quite upset as I queued to pay. This lovely lady came over to see if I was ok and did her best to distract my little girl and get her to smile. She had no luck so instead offered to pack my bags whilst I comforted her. I was so grateful and it meant I was able to keep my little one calm until I paid.

I bought my daughter a two-figure Peppa Pig toy set whilst shopping. Once finished and putting the trolley back one toy was missing. Somehow my daughter had lost it and a member of staff sorting the trollies (Malachai) helped me to look for it. We couldn t find it so I said don t worry and thank you for trying. He then said that we could go in and get another. I said don t worry wasn t necessary but he insisted. We went to where I originally got the toy set but there were none left of that particular one  Malachai then suggested another set  which was actually bigger than the original. He said we needed to go to the customer service desk so I just assumed he would ask it to be given as a good will gesture. Malachai actually wanted to pay for the toy himself! I am so incredibly grateful to him and the kindness he showed myself and my daughter. He is an invaluable member of your team and an outstanding human being. He showed compassion and care and has left me feeling very touched. It was a small act of kindness that has had a great impact.   Tesco please reward him and pass on the kindness to him as he has shown to me. Thank you.  Helen;;;;;2016-08-05T15:12:06+0000;1470409926;2016-08-05 17:12:06;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Promoting healthy eating is so important. Well done Tesco. Perhaps now more offers on fresh fruit and veg (wonky veg boxes for example?) and fewer offers on junk food. I see too many kids at school eating tubes of Pringles for lunch (and breakfast!!) because they are on offer at the supermarket next door and cheaper than a healthy option.;;;;;2016-08-05T13:12:36+0000;1470402756;2016-08-05 15:12:36;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I called the number for my local store to check stock (as i live 2 miles away and don t drive). I was told that there was 8 bags in stock so took my chance and walked down with my 1 and 3 year old. When I got there I checked the obvious places to no avail and proceeded to customer services where I was greeted by a helpful staff member who checked the system  agreed the instock number and came with me to the location suggested on the system. But nope. No sand! The guy then offered to look out the back where he says he roped two others into looking but still no play sand! Much to the disappointment of my 3 year old and frustrating for myself we left empty handed and walked the two miles home again.   Now I am not entirely sure how you lose 80 kilos of sand but I was incredibly annoyed after the excursion and left feeling I had completely wasted my time!

I recently picked 5 totally different style tops from the F&F range but none of them were available in my size  despite them not being in the sale and trying several branches. I was also unable to find any of the 5 tops online and rang the main customer service line where a very unhelpful  lady told me she could not use the style numbers or bar codes I had copied down. The branches were also unable to help me due to a new I.T system which is not as good as the previous one. I realise it is my fault that I am fat but I am told my staff and am aware with my own eyes that stores receive batches of each style with lots of 10 s  12 s and 14 s and very few of the larger sizes. There may be as little as 2 size 20 s for example in each delivery. As the majority of women are size 16 and over and the sale racks are full of the smaller sizes which are unsold  is it time that the powers that be who order sizes into stores increase the number of larger sizes?!;;;;;2016-08-05T10:40:59+0000;1470393659;2016-08-05 12:40:59;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

To be fair the lady on the till got a manager who brought a different books (same type  different colour) and scanned that so I could take the book. But all this took time and shouldn t have happened. Why put things on the shelves if we can t buy them? - and having had it taken off me last week  why was it back?

The trip started off so well  she was playing peekaboo  laughing and giggling at people passing the trolley. The as we approached the biscuit aisle  she went pale and projectile vomited everywhere! And when I say everywhere I mean  down herself  in the trolley  in the shopping bag underneath her full of shopping  her coat and her changing bag hanging underneath her on the little hooky thing.....upon picking her up out the trolley  she was sick again...even worse! It Hit all previous places and then my jeans  my top and managed to find its way in my trainers. At first I was calm thinking someone would offer to help whilst I stripped her down  they didn t  (I can understand why  the amount of sick was a phenomenon - shes tiny - where it all came from I ve no idea!) I managed to grab a lady and ask her to get someone to help me. Her husband ran off to get someone and she stayed with me until he arrived. (Thank you lovely lady  I was genuinely panicking by this point!) The poor lad had no idea what he was about to walk into  he asked if I was Ok...I burst into tears  he immediately stepped up.  Michael  got me some baby wipes  and sent someone else off to get a bucket and began to unpack the sick covered shopping and listed what was there so he could get me new items. Primrose still naked at this point apart from a nappy because Mum of the Year award goes to me forgetting to pack a change of clothes  Michael notices and calls a Manager  Kevin  immediately who tells me to go upstairs and pick anything I wanted to put Primrose in. Through my tears and sobbing on the phone to my other half at this point I pick something for her  changed her and headed downstairs again. I was greeted by a trolley of fresh shopping  Michael and another Manager John. He managed to get a smile out of Primrose and more sobbing out of me! He told me Michael would finish my shopping with me  and he did. He pushed the trolley  grabbed and bleeped the shopping until we were finished and my other half appeared! (I d begged him to come help me because I was having a mental breakdown!) after leaving Tesco I called my Mum and had another breakdown for being so stupid at not being able to keep it together! But genuinely owe Michael and the other staff at Tesco a massive thank you and I will be sending a letter to head office to inform them of their amazing team!!  You have an amazing team at Hookwood  they were attentive  helpful  calming and most of all friendly and reassuring. I am yet to find out this young mans surname so I can send him a little thank you. So if you could help me do this it would be fantastic as Customer services didn t seem to know.  Truly the best customer service I ve ever received.  Thank you again.  Louise & a very sicky Primrose! x;;;;;2016-08-05T10:04:05+0000;1470391445;2016-08-05 12:04:05;5;5;7;0;12;5;4;1;2;0;5;2;0;0;0;0;0

Recently my father sadly died and Mum and Dad s club card is in his name. So this was on the long list of people to advise. Obviously we went to the bank first and your club card was further down the list of priority.  My dad died of mesothelioma which is a cancer brought on by asbestos  which in the eyes of the law is not like other cancers and is classed as unnatural death and therefore we have to go through an inquest. This is obviously upsetting as in our case it won t tell us anything we don t already know and the Coroner Officer has advised us that effectively this is a form filling exercise which will just take time.  Why am I telling you this? This means that at present we only have two interim death certificates  unlike death certificates you cannot buy more  although we have got certified copies from the Solicitor.  Mum contacted Tesco club card and we have experienced two problems:  First  Tesco club card does not accept interim death certificates. We had no problems with the Bank who accepted it immediately and the joint accounts have immediately changed and the sole accounts are in the process of being changed  so no need to wait for the death certificate.  Second  once we have the death certificate (dad died on 7 July and the Coroner Officer advised yesterday that she was hopeful we would get it by the end of September) you apparently don t accept a certified copy. Therefore  we have to send an original which we will have to purchase.  I trust you understand that at this upsetting time your policy actually make the process worse.  How is it that Banks will firstly accept interim death certificates and secondly accept certified copies and you don t?;;;;;2016-08-05T07:01:20+0000;1470380480;2016-08-05 09:01:20;0;5;0;2;7;5;1;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I had a delivery booked for this morning and whilst unloading the driver and myself noticed the security tag still on a bottle.  The driver (van 8B/7341) then asked if I was in all day. He then told me he would get it taken off and deliver it back to me on his way home from work! I feel this driver deserves some recognition as he went above and beyond today!  Please let me know his name or publish this post to him as not enough people get the thanks they often deserve.

The order was supposed to arrive on Monday the 1st August and I recieved a text that it would arrive between 7 and 11am. The courier did not arrive and I had to leave to go to work. No card was left!  No word or details to contact the carrier I was unable to let them know I would be at work. When I arrived home on the second  a card had been left with a number.  I called the number and left a voicemail as there was no answer. I recieved a text the next morning on the third. The person did not respond again.  I rang again and left another voicemail around 10am  again offering 2 different numbers to reach me on to rearrange delivery  no answer or response. I called yet again 45 minutes later  no answer. This time I was advising that there would be someone home to receive the delivery. My husband was actually home ALL day as he had changed work plans. There was NO delivery attempt yet again and no phone all to discuss.  I checked your site to see the status of the order as I was off again today and available to receive the order. It says that delivery was attempted at 13.45 on Wednesday (forget that the text said delivery would be between 7 and 11). Irrespective  someone was at home the entire day on Wednesday.   I have 2 young children who hear a pin drop. We are awake from 5.30 each morning until around 11pm. We did not miss the delivery  your carrier did not even attempt to deliver the parcel.  I m not sure whether these carriers are using their own vehicles  or whether they are using company vehicles. I myself am the logistics manager for my company and know this can be checked by looking at any installed tracker on the vehicle.  Given this situation I strongly suspect that this isn t the first time this particular individual has lied about attempting to make a delivery. 3 alleged attempts.... 1 card recieved.... 3 phone calls .... 0 returned phone calls.  I m extremely disappointed by this service and would hope that Tesco Direct would also be disappointed by the appalling service provided by your contracter.  I expect this to be investigated and I would also like an explanation on why I was not contacted and why they provided false information of delivery on Wednesday (in particular) but also Monday delivery ... Based on the lack of a delivery card on both of these days.  To add  I have never had any issues with delivery or communication with your biggest direct delivery competitor  Asda  and many others as I spend around £300 on online shopping per month.   I look forward to your response. In the meantime I will post this on social media as that may provide a quicker response.  Regards Nada MacKenzie  Nee: Pirrie;;;;;2016-08-04T19:53:54+0000;1470340434;2016-08-04 21:53:54;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

She took time out  ( whilst still scanning) to talk to my girls  asking them lots of questions about the food I was buying  whether they liked it or not  and keeping them so entertained whilst I was packing away. She was so lovely and polite  and an absolute credit to your store. You usually get a lot of bad customer service reviews wherever you go  so I thought it was about time to put some positivity around! She really made me smile when leaving the store  and you don t often get that! So thank you to Shirley  for going above and beyond your normal checkout duties!

If I hadn t slammed my brakes on he would have hit me. What made it worse was that I had my young nephew in the car with me.

I had half a trolley of items and had scanned them all in amounting to just over £100. I got to the end and was  randomly  selected to be checked. I was the only person using the self scanner. Your assistant came over said she had to do a check and then proceeded to scan some items. She then walked off to her cupboard and scanned something on the door  she came back  scanned some more items  walked off did the same thing with the cupboard door. She came back asked me if I d scanned the same item twice and what bar code I d scanned on the in store bakery French stick  not explaining what or why and then continued to scan the rest of my shopping. I told her that she can scan all the shopping and when she had finished could confirm I hadn t taken anything without scanning it.

I ve shopped at Perivale for 24 years so a bit disappointed at the treatment by overzealous managers demonstrating an amazing willingness to exercise stubbornness over common sense...  Shockingly bad customer service at Perivale. Apparently in his (Alan the manager - although he wasn t sure) judgement Gina is buying the wine for her younger sister (no proof or any other indication of this). I was a bit stumped  I ve shopped in Tesco s for 24 years  bought alcohol with my kids in tow without a problem. I asked for the policy on this. Alan s turn to be stumped. Another manager pointed to the sign on the till  but I pointed out that it references proof of age NOT anything else certainly not any policy about the expertise your staff has in profiling customers to determine how people will behave (proof of age was provided in case you were wondering). I challenged this and asked for the policy and guidance on this. There must be some sort of guidance otherwise how can you determine any judgement is valid. This was refused. In fact rather than properly justify really poor customer service  I  was told to complain to head office and then they proceeded to walk away. The attitude of your management frankly stinks. I d suggest doing a mystery shopper exercise on them  as you surely don t wish this behaviour to be representative of your company. Anyhow of course we left empty handed  and hugely dissatisfied. I hope you will  look into this and provide an explanation to me. As for your managers I d suggest some refresher customer service training.;;;;;2016-08-03T22:18:00+0000;1470262680;2016-08-04 00:18:00;4;8;5;1;14;8;4;4;6;0;4;0;0;0;0;1;0

I would just like to remind you of an incident that happened with one of your Durrington delivery drivers.  On arrival at my place of work he was asked whether my car should be moved as there was only a small gap for him to pass through with his trolley.  He said it wasn t necessary.  At this time my front number plate was still attached to my car.  After delivering two trollies of food  it was in his hand.  He told a colleague he may have caught it with his trolley.  When I spoke to him about it he turned into a comedian  i quote  shall I phone Tesco and get them to send you some double sided sticky tape   and with that he left.  I telephoned customer services who said they would investigate and call back.  They did not.  I telephoned again and was informed I would be contacted in 24 hours.  Whilst on this second phone call  the customer services agent contacted Durrington and they spoke to the driver.  I was then informed that the driver denied knocking off my number plate.  And that was that.  the driver s word over mine and my colleagues.  No further contact at all.  the business I work for spend thousands of pounds a year shopping on line and you think it is acceptable to ignore the damage that one of your drivers has caused to my car.  When I am next in work  I shall inform my boss of your  less than customer focused  customer service.;;;;;2016-08-03T11:33:33+0000;1470224013;2016-08-03 13:33:33;5;8;5;0;13;8;4;4;1;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

This is regarding self service checkouts and basically labelling all self service shoppers as thieves. You are more than adware that these machines have many faults. I feel offended by dailymails write ups as not everyone is thieves. This was my comment on the post and il like to kbow what you tecos have to say about this  Not all are thieves. The area of that university is quit a hard up area.  Iv been using them from start ..if machine plays up there is always a member of staff at a stand in the section.  Its surveyed under camera so doubt that tescos has such issues on a constant basis. Personally I do think its down to areas places and and how organizations of staff. There is thieves in every town . if it was as bad as that everywhere the shops wouldnt keep them as long as they have as stores be at a loss and i know in particular tescos hate losses. Also the machines in tescos go standby if it mis scans or it speak out if it thinks its picked up on an un scaned item . sometimes they dont scan so call staff as it goes in a no motion working mode.The machines are far from perfect and have many faults constantly so these statstics are not legitimate as many readings are due too faults via the machines they freeze alot and also things that do scan which can be proved by reciepts that machines quit often state something in bag unscanned.  Its a big fault with them that has never been corrected.  Machines all need updating with a better design with less faults. The amount of time people call staff due to faults is immense.;;;;;2016-08-03T08:47:16+0000;1470214036;2016-08-03 10:47:16;0;6;0;0;6;6;5;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

II use this card to purchase online from Sainsburys  Asda and various other online shops with absolutely no problem at all.  I have more than enough money to cover the goods and it s good enough to use in your stores!  This is 2016 and I m absolutely amazed.  It s put me off giving you my custom for good now.  There were goods that I needed from yourselves that our local Sainburys do not sell and I cannot get to our nearest Tesco store today.

Unfortunately I didn t catch his name  however  he was an older gentleman who was working at about 1 700 hrs . He was incredibly patient with my 10 month old son who refused to hand over his packet of mini cheddars to be scanned and insisted on carrying my items to the car for me  completely unaware of the fact that I have a disability which makes holding even a cup of tea a challenge. Due to the combined effort of my torture of a child who refuses to ever sleep and the many special breeds of idiot I d encountered driving on the road I was actually so flustered that I forgot to even put petrol in my car and left with a soggy packet of mini cheddars and some snacks to keep me going through what is probably going to be yet another sleepless night. However  despite not having remembered to get the petrol I needed this was a very enjoyable experience and I hope my thanks can be passed on to this fantastic gentleman who went out of his way to make my day that little bit easier.

I ordered a TV from them yesterday to be delivered today. The tracker in the website doesn t give you a time only saying that s it s dispatched and is frankly useless. I rang up and asked if they had a rough guide and they said between 1230 and 1430. I was pleased with this and waited until 1530 at home until I rang again to get an update. They then told me that they couldn t find the property when they tried to deliver it at 1330 earlier in the day. I asked if there was a system in place to tell me instead of wasting my time they said no and that it would be delivered tomorrow. I have to be in to sign for it so now that has resulted in 2 days off work  many hours of wasted time and only finding out because I rang up.

Every time I have been shopping in tesco ilminster the staff have all been very friendly  helpful & kind towards us as a family. In the early days they would offer a member of staff to push a trolley whilst I pushed the triplets in their pram to do my shopping. Today I had to go in with all 5 children  being the school holidays much more food is being eaten! I had two trolleys and the staff helped me pack my shopping  load it on to the check out & just generally very kind & friendly! I just want to say thank you to the team at tesco ilminster & hope that you can pass this on to them as they have made life easier when it comes to shopping and allowing me to keep life as normal as possible  big thanks to the team!!!;;;;;2016-08-02T11:03:41+0000;1470135821;2016-08-02 13:03:41;112;9;117;4;130;9;8;1;25;0;112;5;0;0;0;0;0

I said it would be a shame and if they had as would probably have to go elsewhere to get them she said  a lot of people said that .....she was then laughing and joking about it a minute or two later when I was in the next isle so it appears your staff really don t care about potentially losing customers.

I was at Ryde Tesco Extra on the Isle of Wight earlier and was browsing the new extended Free From aisle. A staff member made a point of approaching me and asking what I thought of the new range.   I nodded my approval but did mention that I thought there were too many ready made products and not enough staple ingredients for those who want to make our own without the sugar laden extras - e.g you stock several brands and ranges of gluten free bread and rolls but only 3 different bags of GF flour (Doves plain  SR and bread flour).   I went on to say that I often go to Morrisons purely because they stock Doves Farm rice flours and gram flour. This staff member listened carefully to everything I said  made notes and when I explained that Gram flour is actually chickpea flour she seemed really pleased  saying that several customers had asked for chickpea flour but it was hard to find with suppliers and that this new information could really help.  I have to say that it was a very refreshing touch to have staff discussing with customers what they think - please do encourage more staff to do this sort of thing. As a coeliac  shopping can be mired in frustration (e.g you sell a gluten free fresh baked bread stick....but store it in amongst the other regular fresh baked goods so a true coeliac could still not eat it because of cross contamination) so this conversation did leave me continuing this shopping with a smile on my face...well done to that employee!;;;;;2016-08-01T21:27:50+0000;1470086870;2016-08-01 23:27:50;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Got home and popped them in the microwave to warm them up. After 2 mins the outside was lovely and warm but the insides were still freezing cold. Now  my microwave works fine  so I checked the thighs i had put back in the fridge for tomorrow. Turns out they were frozen inside. Considering they are advertised as able to be frozen  this is not good. You are not supposed to freeze items that have already been defrosted. Also  what would ve happened if I d decided not to warm them up and tried to eat them cold? I think the tescos slogan  every little helps  needs to be changed to  every little helps give you food poisoning .

My nan shops in the Tesco Cheam park farm branch every week and she goes to a specific cashier every week. The reason she goes to this paticular lady is because she gives fantastic service. She packs every one of my nans bags and lifts them into the trolley for her because through conversation she has learnt that my nan has a very week shoulder. If my nan has forgotten something she will go get it for her  she literally cannot do enough. My nan just rang me to tell me that a delivery driver turned up on her door today with the most beautiful bunch of flowers and it was from the cashier Catherine Caffrey. She sent them as she knows again through talking to my nan that she is having a tough time with my grandad who has parkinsons and slight dementia and she wanted to send them to cheer her up. I actually work for Tesco at another store as a manager and used to know Catherine years ago when I worked with her as a team leader but regardless of this I feel what she has done is truly touching and amazing. My nan has done the customer view point before to commend Catherine on service but I don t believe she got the recognition she deserved.

So thanks to someone not doing their job properly (perhaps feeling a little peaky after a heavy Saturday night)  I inadvertently fed all of my BBQ guests out of date potato salad.

I had just come around the corner from the Cross Douglas Road and he was in front of me. He indicated left  and pulled in to the side of the road behind a parked van  so I continued driving to overtake. Just as I was coming up alongside him  he accelerated and swung the van around across the front of my car. I had to slam on the brakes and the wet ground meant I slid up the road and only barely missed him as he burned up into the estate.;;;;;2016-08-01T16:27:10+0000;1470068830;2016-08-01 18:27:10;1;7;1;0;8;7;2;5;3;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I had a beautiful kitchen fitted a few years ago through you and all was great until one of the fronts on the cupboards began to come away. I contacted Tesco Kitchens who sent me a generic letter telling me that Mark 2  the supplier to Tesco  had gone into administration and I would have to wait to see what they decided to do. It has been months now and another cupboard is showing the same signs as the first (which has now split) and I don t know what to do.... I fully understand that the company you used went into administration but I bought the kitchen through you and it is still well within warranty. Many thanks in hope.

Well little things make a big difference and in a country that has a lot of competition and to be frank better customer service I can. Today spent £90 in the Birmingham Road store Dudley. I made a simple request  could you put my fresh chicken in a small bag please? After consulting with a supervisor I was told no! By all accounts they are not allowed. The fact I was placing it next to household goods and other non food items did not matter. The fact that the scents from other purchases may affect my fresh produce again did not matter. So for a bag that costs probably £1 for a thousand (if that) you Tesco have lost my custom...purely out of principle. Morrisons  Asda  Sainsbury and dare I say it Aldi have never declined my request so that s where my next £90 is going!;;;;;2016-08-01T13:18:29+0000;1470057509;2016-08-01 15:18:29;0;12;0;0;12;12;6;6;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Even there promise of more double points weekends is no good they have given us one so far and they wonder why they are losing money.

So this morning before work i nipped in to Tesco South Wigston Leicestershire to pick some up  there were lots on the shelves. Walked to the checkout happy with my nerfs  maple pecan plait and milk for work safe in the knowledge i was going to ambush my 6 year old at the front door tonight and generally annoy mummy for several hours.  At checkout the offer didnt come up  so i asked the assistant.   Im sorry they have to be ordered in its different  was the reply.  Come in! But i have and i can see your fine array of goods on the shelves ready for me to purcahse! its payday morning and i have an ambush planned for tonight!   Tesco could you explain in what way different? I have to now go online to order stock in thats already in South Wigston  wait for it to come in. ( Which is already there ) Go back in to the same shop to pick up stock thats now in ( which technically was on the shelf yesterday by the time i get back in )  This just annoys customers  wastes your staff time explaining this and wastes my time doing a return journey.  Paul ( Not nerfing my daughter tonight ) Howland 39y8m  ps. Dont worry the ambush is still planned just delayed to when the STOCK COMES IN!  pps. The pecan plait was nice though but now i have crumbs in my keyboard.;;;;;2016-08-01T07:27:26+0000;1470036446;2016-08-01 09:27:26;0;7;0;0;7;7;2;5;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Brought kids a phone each  1 December and 1 January.  Got tesco sim cards from tesco north brackell.  Both times I explained we were moving to Cornwall and needed my kids to be contactable. Salesman assured me phones would work. Guess what. We ve been here almost 2 months and the phones are as good as useless. The kids have no reception at all. They cannot use their phones. Most areas of Cornwall are not covered by reception for them.  I ve another year of paying for phones that cannot be used. I ve left it till now so we can check reception around Cornwall.  It s disgusting. £30 a month for NOTHING. I ve either got to start up a new contract with another company and pay you or not have reception for my kids. I m not happy at all.;;;;;2016-08-01T06:25:05+0000;1470032705;2016-08-01 08:25:05;0;5;0;0;5;5;2;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We bought a Toshiba television just over a year ago and it s just stopped working; the TV is in excellent condition. I looked on the internet to see whether there was a solution to getting the TV working again and I discovered that Toshiba TV s are notorious for switching off and on randomly and just breaking. So Tesco stock a brand that they must know is defective because they do their research on products before selling them.  I contacted Tesco who gave me an email address to send the details to and was told they d be in touch. They didn t bother to get in touch  I contacted them again a few days later where a decision on my television had been made (they just didn t bother to contact me to tell me what the outcome was). According to Tesco there is no guarantee that a television will last more than a year; really?  They have offered me just over a third of what the television is worth and I m expected to fork out the rest. I was given no option of a repair or replacement and no explanation what was wrong with the TV (these are technical experts who work in this department apparently). I asked to have the contract details to lodge a complaint and according to the person I spoke to there is no avenue to complain other than Trading Standards.  Trading Standards told me to go in-store where the TV was bought from and ask to see their terms and conditions  read them then make a formal complaint to Tesco; I did and the girl on the customer desk looked confused  had to ask a colleague who informed us they were wrote on the back of the receipt; they re not. I went on their website and searched for television terms and conditions and only t&c s for special offers came up. I then searched just terms and conditions and they came up but only related to statutory rights where a third party seller is involved.  Tesco clearly don t care about selling potential defective goods to their customer s. They still stock Toshiba with it s known television faults  I expect they buy the televisions with a known defect at a very low price and in my opinion intentionally rip their customers off. I won t be shopping their again and I ll be sure to tell people why.";;;;;2016-08-01T05:22:47+0000;1470028967;2016-08-01 07:22:47;1;3;2;1;6;3;3;0;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;1;0
