Have been a loyal customer for years and spend hundreds of pounds a month on online food shopping. Ordered my shopping on wed night to be delivered with the new saver delivery slot (6pm-10pm). Was due to arrive thursday night. 10pm and no shopping arrived....11pm and no shopping arrived. Husband Finally went to bed at 11.30pm as had work the next day. I called the helpline at 7am and was given no reason or explanation as to why my £255 food shop had not arrived. I was told it could no be guarenteed to be delivered today! I tried to cancel the order to be told would take 3-5 days to go back into my account. Not acceptable so i agreed to wait for a redelivery. Got £20 voucher when i asked for complaints department! I was on night shift... so got up at 5pm with a text to say will be delivered between 7-8pm. I left for work at 7.30pm and still no sign. Hubby called me and said it arrived at 20:15pm and 21 items are beyond use by date tomorrow and two are actually use by today!!!!!! Total cost £35!!! Oh and i got my £1 delivery refunded and a £5 gift card!!!!!! The driver apparently ran out of time!!! What a mess!!!! Any suggestions what i do with my £35 worth of food that needs eaten tomorrow?? Surely i should have been a priority to deliver on time today. Very disappointed Tesco :(;;;;;2016-09-30T21:36:49+0000;1475271409;2016-09-30 23:36:49;0;2;0;3;5;2;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Someone going to bed tonight with an empty stomach will happily eat that tomorrow. I know I would cos I do. Why is it acceptable to only donate food that has long life.

He didn t say hello or anything when I answered the door. He didn t offer to help with the shopping. I have a 2 year old daughter who loves it when tesco deliver as she loves to say hello to the drivers. Normally the drivers say hello and interact with my daughter. The driver last night completely ignored her calling out  hello tesco man  from our lounge repeatedly. He didn t even smile or look at her. I felt this was extremely rude and left my daughter confused as to why he hadn t said hello back. Lastly  he didn t have the little computer for me to sign as it was charging in his van. He said he would sign it for me!! I do not want anyone else signing something on my behalf. Now I know it s only for my shopping but that s not the point. I asked if he had some paper I could sign which he got out of his pocket along with a pen. Now his next action really left me feeling insulted - before he took the pen back he took a used tissue from his pocket in order to take the pen from me like he didn t want to to7ch something I had touched. Just felt rude to me. Overall really not impressed with the driver last night!;;;;;2016-09-30T06:54:39+0000;1475218479;2016-09-30 08:54:39;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Tesco is the only place I can order with the the school logo as the local uniform shop only supply jumpers. We re this joy the case I d have long since given up as its pretty hopeless 😩 I ve even made phone calls to try and establish when stock would be available  and even suggested that Tesco takes some stock from elsewhere - I can order the exact same cardigan without school embroidery no problem at all! I find it astonishing that such a well established company like Tesco is unable to fulfill a simple supply and demand issue. For almost 7 weeks now you ve not had stock of the one item my daughter requires for school (in the correct size). It s abhorrent;;;;;2016-09-29T22:28:19+0000;1475188099;2016-09-30 00:28:19;0;5;0;0;5;5;2;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Out of the many fast drivers going past  he was the only person who came and helped us by pushing our car to the side of the road and offering all the support we could. I didn t catch his name or his lorry number but what a fantastic man he was. Again  I must say you have some fantastic staff members working for you and he further proved that to us tonight. Hats off to you sir and hopefully you will be praised as highly as you deserve!

The other member of staff asked if it was the 500 or 1TB I was after  to which i said i really didnt mind my sons would be happy with either. Instead of saying sorry  we dont have any he replied with  ive took the last 1  its waiting out the back for me for when i finish  with a smug look on his face. If he would of just said no i would of been fine with that  fair enough ive missed out. I went to the customer service desk on the way out just to mention the absolutely disgusting customer service i recieved  Tavon listened to what i had to say then called a manager. Whilst waiting he asked if I would still like to purchase 1 if he checked the system to see what was left. Whilst waiting he dealt with another customer who had also come to complain about the same members of staff I had! Throughout the whole time he was dealing with us he was polite  smiling and went above and beyond to help sort the problem out. I got my sons their PS4 & i hope Tavon gets some recognition for his excellent customer service.;;;;;2016-09-29T19:13:02+0000;1475176382;2016-09-29 21:13:02;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I paid for my groceries (£7.10) using my credit card  it showed as accepted on the card machine and then flashed up  accepted  on the till computer screen so I started to walk off.  I happened to turn back round and noticed the checkout assistant looked a bit confused so I asked if everything was ok and she said that the system had frozen and no receipt had come out and that she would get her manager.  So along he comes and tells me that despite my payment being accepted  I d have to wait around 10 mins for him to check his back office system for the payment.  I explained that I was in a hurry and that I would leave my number and should there be any issues I would pop back in later and pay again.  Unfortunately this was a bit too straight forward and drama-free for him so he told me I would have to leave my purchases if I were to leave the shop.  Considering my payment had been accepted  I was not willing to leave behind what I had paid for and proceeded to leave the shop.  The male manager and another female member of staff then followed me out to my car trying to get my purchases off of me.  They were taking down my car registration details to call the police about my  theft  of Ryvita  bananas  ham  Philadelphia and Snackajacks at which point I again offered them my name  address and telephone number so they could contact me if there was indeed an issue but they didn t want this  only my registration number so they could call the police  which he started to do before I drove off.  Unsurprisingly  the police haven t been in touch about this trivial matter!    I am deeply disappointed in the treatment I received from the staff in this store (mainly the manager)  in no way was I trying to thieve my Ryvitas etc  in fact it was the store manager trying to steal lunch off of a very evidently pregnant woman!!  The payment hasn t shown up yet on my statement so if indeed the computer freeze caused the payment not to be processed then please do let me know and I will settle my debt ASAP!

My name is Mandy and I m a tesco quark addict.   I am afraid that I am not yet ready to step into rehabilitation for his addiction and therefore it needs to be fed! Much to my great distress it appears that tesco quark is out of stock in all my local tesco stores 😭. I am a slimming world member and so far since January 2016 have lost nearly 7 stone both on my own and with the help of slimming world. I can quite confidently say that being able to eat lovely tesco quark by the bucket load has been crucial in my weight loss journey.   Please please can you tell me how long it will be before I can feed my addiction again ?

I think her name was Janice who was working in the toy section last night (Wed 28th). She was so helpful in helping me down to the checkout with some toys from your excellent sale and keeping them there for me so I didn t have to carry them round the store.  I noticed her chatting to other customers and giving great customer service while also working hard to get more toys out all with a smile on her face. I hope I ve got her name right and she gets some kind of recognition from the store manager. Great to see great customer service like this in a busy store it also made me buy more as I didn t have to carry so much round the store. 😁;;;;;2016-09-29T06:23:09+0000;1475130189;2016-09-29 08:23:09;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Firstly  I think it s a great idea. But. Last night at about 7.40 I went to use the machine  it has a very bright display screen and no external light around it. It took a while to go through the process of picking my car  etc.  When I d finished I stepped away and could see a thing for a brief moment  because my eyes were going from such extreme brightness to darkness.  This panicked me a little and i stopped walking.  After the 2/3 seconds it took for my eyes to adjust I realised there was someone else stood looking at me. Waiting to use the machine.  This frightened me. Please can this be be addressed in terms of some extra external lighting.  Due to working hours I don t use the store during the day  but this has put me off going there at night.  Tell trouble is. For two weeks the lighting at the great notley store car park hasn t worked!;;;;;2016-09-29T06:05:21+0000;1475129121;2016-09-29 08:05:21;1;4;1;0;5;4;1;3;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

However  I would love to express my gratitude and take a moment to praise both Peter Mitchell and Alex McKenzie of the Tesco Direct Customer Services Team.  Peter has been helping me over the past three weeks and Alex has helped me tonight and I am in amazement due to them going out of their way to help  doing above and beyond what their job entails them to do and just being lovely.  It was my daughter s Birthday a few weeks ago and the one thing she asked for was the Club Petz Lucy Interactive doll. Not cheap for what it is at £40 but Tesco had it reduced at £24. I bought it back in May or June ready for September.  On opening it for her Birthday  I then went to set it up for her to find it wasn t working. Assuming it was faulty  I sent an email to Tesco explaining I d had it for a few months but it had only just been opened and Peter emailed me back offering me a refund or a replacement. Being a much wanted toy  I went for a replacement and a new Lucy arrived the next day.  Again  unfortunately  Lucy didn t work  and so I replied again and Peter got back to me. He offered me  as before  a replacement or a refund if I d lost confidence in the toy  and I chose to give Lucy one more shot  and the next day Lucy #3 arrived.  As expected  but whilst trying to be optimistic  Lucy didn t work. I emailed again but asked this time if I could have a refund so that my little girl could buy something else with the money.  Before  my emails had been saved for Peter to reply to but this time Alex replied.  He explained that he had processed my refund and that  as usual  it would take 3-5 days to go into my account.  He also told me that he had sent my daughter a  little gift  due to Lucy not having worked  and included the catalogue number in case I wanted to have a look.  That  little gift  was a large Disney Princess doll and tea party set which costs pretty much the same much as Lucy did at £40 rrp  now £20 on sale.  To say I am surprised as it was so unexpected is an understatement.  I am so grateful and I know my daughter is going to be so amazed and love her so  so much.  As well as all of that  both Peter and Alex have wished my little one a Happy Birthday and Alex has asked how she is after I apologised for a delay in emailing due to her being unwell.  They both have gone above and beyond to help me and I have never had such a helpful and happy outcome to an unfortunate issue before.  Well done Peter and Alex.  Your work hasn t gone unnoticed or unappreciated.  X;;;;;2016-09-28T22:03:57+0000;1475100237;2016-09-29 00:03:57;5;3;6;0;9;3;2;1;0;0;5;1;0;0;0;0;0

He was sitting in a trolley when a small slither of metal got stuck in his thumb. I just want to praise the staff Gillian and Chris who dealt with it amazingly. My little boy is usually terrified of strangers and both staff where extremely patient with him and the first aider Chris got the metal out in one try. Cannot fault their customer service. Nothing was too much trouble from either of them and Gillian (who is management of some sort) even gave my son a little gift for being super brave.

I am not one to normally praise Tesco and I guess here I am not really. The praise goes to a thoughtful  caring  kind and considerate employee at one of your stores.  Tesco on the Dedworth Rd in Windsor. Within here works a certain individual whom most staff would learn from.  This member of staff overheard me saying that it was my son s first outing since having complex surgery. Not the most exhilarating of places but it proved to be a trip he nor I will ever forget.  This employee asked her management if my son would be eligible for a store gift voucher as a special treat after what he had been through and as a thanks from Tesco as they want to say thank you to their customers. We are the kind of family who do not have much luck but this employee has made my son s life have a glimmer of happiness due to her person. Thank you to Rachel Appleton who has worked for Tesco for many years according to her name badge as my son saw. You should train your staff based upon her workings.;;;;;2016-09-28T19:23:08+0000;1475090588;2016-09-28 21:23:08;39;18;40;2;60;18;14;4;29;0;39;1;0;0;0;0;0

I wonder if he genuinely thought I was grateful for being able to  get done  as I try to stop my screaming toddler from running out into the street to follow a dog she saw whilst simultaneously trying to empty a crate whilst totally not hiding my unimpressed face.   I ve complained about this several times to your costumers services before eventually putting it in my delivery notes to not come early. It usually automatically puts it in the notes now but I guess it stopped when we moved house a few weeks ago so that ll be going back on. I always answer it as well because when they come THAT early I just assume I must have booked the wrong slot.

Im a full time student on a very tight budget who is now getting to the point that I cannot shop in your stores. I understand you are introducing you new fake farm ranges however do you not realise by increasing the pricess by as much as you have and reducing your value range you are putting yourself out of people budgets and they are going to shop elsewhere?

I run an after school club so everything has to run on time. My manager called me at 18.10 to tell me Tesco hasn t arrived  i came back to the club to let my staff go home as i was now paying them over time for the  lateness. I called Tesco and waited 10 min before an answer. still at this time I had heard nothing from either the driver or Tesco about the delay. Once Tesco had answered my call i had a lovely lady on the other side of the phone. She called the driver   who replied he was running late and couldn t see how far down i was on the list! she said the driver estimated he d be 10 min. this is at 18.40. I mentioned to the lady  on the phone it had to be by 6 50 as a yoga class was about to be set up. the driver asked the call assistant where to go once at the school. i heard the conversation and explained to pass school and go to the field. I waited and waited. the yoga class arrived  my meeting was about to start in the next village  and  i hadn t been home to see my children. I went out to the school road at 19 07 to see if i could see the Tesco van  I saw the Van and the driver. he had disturbed the school who to were having a meeting  Obversely  not listening to the directions given. He followed me to where i had told him originally to go. He then continued to be loud while unloading the shopping. the yoga class was trying to have a class! So My shopping arrived late  no info about the delay. I missed my meeting my 15 minutes. i didn t see my children and I had to pay my staff for over time! Is this right. is this how you d like to be spoken about? I have emailed Tesco and thePperson who relpied to me offered my £5 evoucher. I m sorry but the whole inconvenience cost me a lot more then that. I am a very appointed customer     .;;;;;2016-09-28T12:45:31+0000;1475066731;2016-09-28 14:45:31;0;4;0;0;4;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My 3 year old son threw up in my car this morning as I was getting petrol.  I ran in to the shop to pay and buy some wipes. The ladies gave me blue roll to help clean up and while I was sorting him out Kelly came and put cones around my car and told me to take my time helping him. She came back out again a minute later with carrier bags  more blue roll and a drink of water for my little boy. She chatted and reassured him while I wiped up my car quickly. The other lady then came out with more carrier bags and offered to help sort out the rubbish.  They both made a stressful situation much easier for me and my little one and I wanted to thank them again. Not many people would go out of their way like they did and we both really appreciated it.

You really need to take a look at what your competitors charge  such as Asda. I usually use Asda mainly because their delivery fees are reasonable and I rarely pay more than £2  even at peak times. To save even more money  I now pay for a delivery pass at £5 a month for any slot I want. If you think about  you want MORE money for one delivery  than Asda charge me for unlimited deliveries for an entire month!!!

Sadly this store closed :(   I needed some women s clothing basics and I tried to add them to my online shop but I don t think it would let me do it.  Seems to me that you could include the option of people adding these items to their grocery shop  as they would in real life if they were walking around a large Tesco.

Was told when I ordered the cleaner that delivery would be Saturday. 3.05pm Saturday we received an email saying order wouldn t be delivered like planned and that it would be delivered Monday instead.  Again  no delivery Monday. Even after countless attempts calling in the store and constantly checking the online tracking. Phoned up tesco direct Monday evening to be told that under no circumstances should this have happened and that it would be delivered today and guess what? No delivery today either.  I have contacted Tesco direct twice today and I ve been fed utter nonsense by staff on the phone with no explanation as to where my parcel has gone and now I ve been told that if there s no sign of it tonight I will be contacted in the morning to sort out another delivery.  £100 cleaner gone walkabout  with no one knowing where it s gone  no explanation for me at all only  it s on the van for delivery  which it has been on the van for delivery since 12.35 yesterday. So I can only assume it s coming from China?!  Absolutely disgusted and appalled.  Tesco are quick enough to take payment from my bank account but not so quick to chase my issue up.;;;;;2016-09-27T18:57:44+0000;1475002664;2016-09-27 20:57:44;3;2;4;0;6;2;1;1;0;0;3;1;0;0;0;0;0

Today you ve implemented a car parking system to prevent people  abusing  the free parking facility  I don t object to that  but the system you ve brought in  is to say the least CRAZY!! To get free parking you now have to get an extra receipt when paying for your items (£5 minimum spend) then after exiting the store you have to find the machines located outside in the rain/hail/snow/sleet/wind  to firstly enter the last 3 digits of your car reg then find & select the image of your vehicle amongst at least 8 that are shown on the screen  then the extra receipt received at the checkout has to be scanned  but of course that doesn t work  so you have to fudge around to find reading glasses to manually enter the code  all of this while trying to hold a bag of shopping that you ve just bought & don t want to put down on the wet ground as its a hessian reusable bag!!! This is just my story of a visit to Tesco today and what it will be like from now on with winter almost upon us  for mums with screaming children & a trolley full of shopping it certainly isn t going to be fun!! I ve spoken to Julie Ashcrof duty manager  since I returned home but she couldn t give any real reason as to why most importantly the machines are located externally  other than an outside company is responsible for the setup . Come on you re going to tell me Mr Tesco had no input in this. Tesco you ve failed miserably in implementing something that could & should have been so simple - have some sense & have a rethiink. For me it s out of town shopping for my groceries now!!;;;;;2016-09-27T16:42:45+0000;1474994565;2016-09-27 18:42:45;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was given a delivery slot of between 11&12. So far  so good. Had a missed call at around 11.30 when I was seeing to my son so I called back and there was no answer. Around 12.45  I called Tesco to see where it was and my delivery was the last on a route and had been returned! There wasn t a knock at the door or anything so I wasn t happy. They said I would be called back within an hour. So i didn t seem too pushy I left it an hour and half before I phoned back. I was passed through to someone at the Bradford store (which was unprofessionally done because the man thought he was still speaking to customer services). He had just come on shift and nothing had been done about my order. He asked me to leave it with him and he would call me back within 10 minutes  he had to check the routes and see if anyone could get my shopping delivered to me. 3 minutes later  he called and said he had someone to deliver my shopping and they would be doing so in half an hour (usual time it takes to get from Bradford to my home). Half an hour later  my shopping turned up so a massive thank you to James from the Bradford store and the delivery driver who picked up the job (sorry  I didn t get your name) You turned a negative experience (first one from tesco) into a positive one and deserve a big pat on the back!;;;;;2016-09-27T16:25:27+0000;1474993527;2016-09-27 18:25:27;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Until just recently this was a service that I thought was really good value for money.  My shopping gets picked and delivered from the Kingston store in Milton Keynes and recently the service has been really unacceptable.  I usually buy 5 days worth of meals and other household items per order. Often there is lots of  fresh meat  fruit  vegetables and various chilled items.  The issue recently has been the shelf life of my ordered items. At best there is usually 1 item that is  use by  the date of delivery and at worst there has been 5 items  use by  date of delivery. The delivery drivers inform me that this should never happen and if there is a short shelf life  it should be highlighted on the receipt to give you the option of sending it back. This is not happening. With pretty much every order over the last 10 weeks I have had to ring up to complain and then get a refund. I then have to go to a Tesco shop to replace the items which takes up my time and uses fuel. I have already paid £69 to have my shopping delivered so this really isn t proving very cost effective. The customer service department on the telephone have been very good. Refunding me for the items and emailing the Kingston store with my feedback. They have even requested (several times) that my shopping be audited to stop this happening. It hasn t worked  in fact it has got worse. The home delivery manager from Kingston did  telephone me to arrange redelivery of some food and when I asked her why my shopping wasn t being audited  she replied  well it will be now!  and told me she had to go.  My shopping clearly isn t being audited and to honest I am pretty fed up with the Kingston stores attitude. I would like this matter to be looked into further as I think the problems aren t just with the pickers  clearly the managers need some feedback too and policies need to be changed. I will not be renewing my delivery saver package this year and would in fact like my fee for the last 12 months refunded.  Also I will no longer be shopping with Tesco which means I won t buy food  fuel  clothes  anything from Tesco direct and we will be transferring the balance from our Tesco credit card to another provider. There has been more than enough opportunity to get things right but it simply hasn t happened for whatever reason and I do not feel valued as a loyal customer. It appears to me that once you have my money the customer service can go out of the window! I have posted this complaint today on social media as I want to be listened to and the complaint to be actioned. Hope to hear from you soon Kind regards  Sheryl;;;;;2016-09-27T11:36:04+0000;1474976164;2016-09-27 13:36:04;2;2;2;0;4;2;2;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

First off I arrive and realise I don t have any change for a trolley  unlike ANY OTHER supermarket in MK here I have to use the archaic system of a pound coin to retrieve a trolley  so a trip to the ATM and then customer services and I can finally start my shop. But wait! Said pound coin falls straight out of the knackered old trolley as soon as it released!  Now I can start my shop I make way to the fresh produce aisles  to find literally every other item totally empty  resulting in me settling for items I didn t want or leaving items altogether.  Once finished I make my way to the tills and they are closing faster than people are walking up.  I d would expect these conditions at 8 in the evening but at 5:30 when customers are coming in post work  I expect better!  Disappointed.;;;;;2016-09-26T17:17:26+0000;1474910246;2016-09-26 19:17:26;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

After wondering around the clothing section after doing a grocery shop (he was aware of the time and was closing soon) he asked a member of staff for help. She did help him showing him the different socks you sold but then as it hit 4pm the lights went out and she said sorry cant help you now its 4pm and she walked off! He came home with no socks cue upset daughter!

The salt flavour was so strong it made my 2yo sick and my husband who usually never complains refused to eat it. He wouldn t even give it to the dog due to how salty it was.  I guess the lesson learnt is a joint that costs £4 is never going to be the best.

The good Quality food that goes in the bin is ridiculous  I was in your  fratton way branch portsmouth this morning at 9:30am your reduced section was filling up  your staff were behind as usual pricing it up so I asked as saw 6 packs of sealed fish pie mix 9hrs past use by date which we all know is un realistic as most food can add 3-10 days on to it.  I would of cooked it all today but no Tesco s would rather bin it  please don t give me  but If you get sick its on us  rubbish it s on me I know what I am eating.  There was nothing wrong with the fish Tesco s your just plain waste full. If your staff had done the job correctly and checked the shelves in their Isle yesterday they would ve seen the date on it and just maybe you wouldn t be wasting it today.   What I loved most was the attempt from your staff to make me believe it s not going to be wasted.  So basically those fish died for nothing your clearly impacting the environment and have no respect for it.  Tesco s it s time to change!;;;;;2016-09-26T09:15:55+0000;1474881355;2016-09-26 11:15:55;0;8;1;0;9;8;7;1;7;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0

We ordered and paid for online grocery to be delivered on 20/9 to be delivered 12 - 2pm. My partner received missed calls at 1.23pm when he was taking a shower and called back the same numbers (no one answered!) This is still within our delivery time.   We received email from Tesco saying failure delivery to due to no one at home and replied back on the same day asking on how our orders would be delivered again BUT RECEIVED NO REPLY? It s already nearly a week. Is someone going to follow up on our paid order???  Can someone follow up on our order please?!  Order number:13225-10801  I think Tesco should improve their services by also checking at our doors to see if anyone is at home. Not just merely making calls. What happens if we are in the bathroom and unable to hear the calls? We booked a time slot for a reason  and that would mean we will be at home during that period. OR maybe a suggestion  pre-emp us a call before coming?! if you re really worried we would be  out  ?;;;;;2016-09-26T06:19:08+0000;1474870748;2016-09-26 08:19:08;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I had arranged for my shopping to be delivered between 7-11pm tonight. My husband received a text to say they would deliver between 9 and 10pm. At 9.41 a missed call from the driver as they were unable to find the property (even though I had written very clear instructions on the order on how to find the property and other drivers had never had a problem)! At 9.44 we call the number back. No answer. When we phone tesco at 10.01 we are told the driver attempted to deliver and had to take our delivery back to the store. So in the space of 3 mins after calling us the driver had returned to the store. I find this very hard to believe! Reality is we were blatantly the drivers last delivery. They couldn t be bothered to find the property and when we didn t answer the call thought  I ve attempted to deliver so end of my shift!   Absolutely ridiculous. The worst part of it all the fact that my twin babies now do not have the milk they need.

This is something I truly feel passionate about and cannot believe in this day and age people are still so ignorant abut special needs. Earlier I was in Tescos. I see an adult with Austim whom I know well. I hear the Tesco workers moaning that he is always in here and does not listen to them and is always asking questions. To which they were complaining about whatever he was picking up. He took too many toilet rolls which if I am correct he is paying for and can take as many as he wants. As I queue I hear a member of staff ask another member of staff to come and see him and what this  troublemaker  is doing. I inform the lady on the till that I know him and he has special needs she had never heard of  Austim  and could I tell another member of staff to which I did   tut  tut  and he turned his back on me. I am utterly shocked and disgusted that this is happening  I could not believe no one would understand what I was saying and even worse than that I had members of staff turn their backs on me. Extremely shocked at Tesco and their workers. 😡  I hope the staff are disciplined and trained  if they can t be respectful make them work away from customers.

Turns out the member of staff forgot  to which she offered a refund  witch I declined  and when I then asked her why TESCO S brand didn t have sell by dated on  she grinned/smirked.

It is  or at least should be known that you cannot reduce or promote infant 1st milks.

As the queues down parking aisles merge onto the main exit road  the  delight  that was the car park attendant gave precedence to the first parking aisle  whilst signal to the main exit road queue to wait. There were a further 3 parking aisles full of queued cars waiting to merge onto the main exit road  meaning that if you were in one of these queues (like I was) your wait was far longer than that of the first aisle. I watched that first aisle empty 3 times while stationary waiting to exit!

I went with Sam and he climbed in the trolley. No room for shopping like  but who cares as he is happy. Walked in the store and  Dear me  The noise was winding me up. I could see Sam was getting agitated  but I went with it hoping he would calm. A few items were bought before I noticed Sam changing. I stopped the trolley and tried to calm him but it was too late. The meltdown had started.The Colli-flower went flying through the air and I just managed to save the breadstick. Then  the high pitched scream came. That earth shattering scream that breaks your heart. Breaks my heart  but not the silly cow nosing at the cheese in the aisle. Oh no!! She felt the need to face us and shout very load  for f*cks sake . I asked her if the scream had effected her ears and her reply was  Yes actually  it did . Then it was my turn  Good!! Now you may have a small understanding what this guy is going through. He hears everything 20  30 40 times more than me and you. He is hearing all kinds in here and it has caused this meltdown. Not that an idiot like you is going to understand or care about an upset child as you are to interested in your selfish ears.       With that I heard clapping. Turning around I saw a man and women applauding and saying  Well said lad . The woman trotted of head down and ashamed. The couple offered to walk around and help me get my shopping. also said they would pack everything at the till for me. I refused their offer but thanked them for it. At the till Sam was still upset and a few tuts were given his way. These were solved by me glaring at those doing it. I will not just take Sam out of the store  I cuddle him and help him through it. Then we loaded the shopping and the lady on the till began her magic. She told the customers  This will take as long as this little boy needs  so I suggest you move to another till if you are in a hurry . Then she refused to allow me to pack a bag  and let Sam play with the card machine that he was interested in. She was wonderful and helped calm Sam down by allowing him all the time he needed. Her name was Toni  and I gave feedback about her great service to her manager...... Shopping is never boring with our kids.  Big well done to Toni  #AutismAwareness #DifferentNotLess;;;;;2016-09-25T15:14:38+0000;1474816478;2016-09-25 17:14:38;7;1;7;0;8;1;1;0;1;0;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

Unfortunately this wood is not fit for purpose and you should not be selling it. It has obviously been left out in the rain outside the store or got wet in transit as all it did was produce vast quantities of smoke. When we chopped the wood in half it was soaking wet inside. It clearly has not been seasoned before sale. We are extremely disappointed that these are being sold and it ruined our campfire!

His friend drove the car next to us n open the door for him. He drag my sister on the floor until the bag came off. They took off n we look around for the security officer for help. When the guy came in white uniform he just listen n call another Indian guy who told us to check out the cctv camera which was just a few feet away from us. My sister went to the office but could not view it. They told my sister that they just saw us pushing the trolley n opening the car booth to put things in but can t see the proton car n the snatch thieve incident 😬 The people in Tesco was of no help non did they take any responsibility for the incident that happen inside the car park. We have to run around to go to the security office n then customer service counter to write a report. No assistance was given to us. It seem like a daily incident n nobody was interested in what happen to us. Lucky for us my sister was not hurt but the incident was quite traumatic to have your bag snatch in broad daylight.  I hope Tesco Ara damansara will take responsibility to beef up security in their car park n be more people friendly when incidents like that happens to their customers.  They did not render any help to us except to listen and walk away.  We will not be going to Tesco to do our shopping any more.  Tesco should take more responsibility to ensure the safety of their customers.;;;;;2016-09-25T10:46:37+0000;1474800397;2016-09-25 12:46:37;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I arrived at the store at 9:40pm (well within the 10pm specified in the email) and was refused by the store manager (so he claimed to be) as it was  too late .  I challenged him  and to my disbelief he admitted he did not want to go to the trouble of getting my order as he wanted to go home on time.  Does it really take 20mins to get a collection  instead he chose to be difficult for the next 20mins (surely he could have got my order in that time)?!

I have got to say you are in my very very bad books this evening. So today I went to your Middleton store to buy the ingredients for a lovely paella. Browsing your fish mongers you had a great selection of fresh fish. I decided on fresh cod loin  Raw king prawns and fresh live mussels. So I embarked on cooking up a storm at home for our family Spanish night. The dish was in full swing  almost complete. I opened the prawns and put them in. I opened the mussels and a smell worse than death erupted in my nostrils. The mussels were not live mussels at all they were very very dead and it appeared by the smell that they had been for some time. After this I not only was very disappointed by the mussels the thought of eating the beautiful paella I had loving prepared was turning my stomach. As a fish lover I have got to tell you this saddens me very much. So the £30 on quality ingredients I spent in your store today has literally just gone down the toilet.

In the past I ve found you to be over priced but will returning next week for my full shop 😀;;;;;2016-09-24T18:19:56+0000;1474741196;2016-09-24 20:19:56;1;4;1;1;6;4;2;2;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

After waiting 6 minutes to speak to a customer service manager the lady I spoke to phoned the store and was told that it was so busy it just got missed. I understand we are all human and mistakes are made but there was no one else there so to lie about it really annoyed me. I was then told that they couldn t deliver my order as all the vans were leaving now and I would have to go to store to collect it and as the click and collect pod closes at 6pm I would have to go to store. So after dragging 3 hungry  tired and grumpy children back to the store I was kept waiting for 20 for my order to be found. Morale of the story don t bother with click and collect unless you have time to check every item is there!;;;;;2016-09-24T17:23:40+0000;1474737820;2016-09-24 19:23:40;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

And instead in its place  where it is marked down for two different free from sandwiches  some pasta..which I cannot eat! This is not the first time it s happened either. Over the past few months I ve come in to grab a quick sandwich on the run to find nothing there and instead something else I can t eat in its place when it clearly states free from and there has never been any tags to say the items are not in stock.  I can see you probably don t stock very many and may run out by lunchtime but I have been in first thing in the morning  mid morning..basically all times of day and have never seen anything there but again something I can t eat. I have only ever been able to buy a free from sandwich once from your Eastbourne store and that was when they first came out.  It would also be a good idea to have some other alternatives instead of just a plain boring chicken salad(which never has enough chicken in!) maybe some free from pasta salads  rice salads or rice noodles would also be a brilliant option to quickly grab on the run and to be in the meal deal as us with health issues and intolerances etc are constantly getting ripped off for something we can t help!  Your free from section is slowly getting better so why not make your fresh sandwich/lunch selection better too?;;;;;2016-09-24T17:14:46+0000;1474737286;2016-09-24 19:14:46;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My partner  23 month old son and I popped in quickly to grab some bits and bobs when suddenly my son begins to projectile vomit down one the aisles completely out of the blue. There was an assistant literally standing inches away from us during this and I had to ask twice if she could help us before she walked off without saying a word  I assume to get someone else to deal with it. After waiting in the aisle with my son still vomiting  I ran to see if anyone could help. A passing employee merely said  a cleaners coming  without even offering to help.  Thankfully a lovely customer stopped and opened a bottle of water she d just bought and gave us a material like bag to help clean up my son and partner who were both stood  covered in vomit.  Out of everyone in store today only one lady  a customer  stopped to help and none of your staff to offer any assistance. The customer service was such a disappointment.;;;;;2016-09-24T16:29:09+0000;1474734549;2016-09-24 18:29:09;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Ordered a TV from Tesco Direct on Monday  paying extra for nominated delivery. it arrived with the screen shattered to pieces. Contacted customer services and that model was out of stock. Have to kick up a fuss about the delivery fee and the discount code in order for them to agree to allow me to choose an alternative up to £20 more expensive. Said they could not compensate me for sitting in all day and that the alternative TV would be delivered on Friday. CEO s office contacted me and gave me £50 compensation for the fact I wasted a day of my time etc.  Waited in all day on Friday; I did not leave my home once. I was tracking the delivery on Yodel s website  only for them to update the status to  sorry we missed you  we ve left a calling card . No calling card was left  of course because delivery had not been attempted. Yodel refused to do anything other than to say they would  try again tomorrow . I should point out that they were supposed to be collecting the faulty TV to return to you.  Contacted the CEO s office again. They arranged for the TV to be delivered last night at 8pm from a local store (thank you for that  that was appreciated)  however the driver was not instructed to collect the faulty TV. So now I need to give you access to my home for a THIRD time to collect it. However  given that Yodel said that they would be coming again today  I waited in and the tracker has now been updated to  delay - delivery in the next 72 hours .  Contacted customer services who have said they can arrange collection on a day suitable to me but it will be a window from 7am-7pm. They also want to use Yodel  the company who could not be bothered attempting to deliver on the contracted date and have now still not managed to do so and are expecting to me to wait about for another 3 days.   By now I have wasted THREE days of my time for this complete and utter shambles. There is absolutely no way that I will be wasting a fourth day of my life on this nonsense  waiting around for incompetent no show contractors. You can contact me and arrange a collection on a suitable day and provide me with a reasonable window for collection. I am employed and have things to do not involve sitting in my home like a recluse waiting for you to get your act together.  I fully expect to be compensated for the time I have spent wasted on this ridiculous situation that should have been resolved in 24 hours but almost a week later is still dragging on. My time is easily quantifiable.

As she is setting a bad example to the rest of the staff working there  maybe this explains why the attitude from the majority of the staff members is disgraceful. She was rude  and didn t say a word throughout the transaction apart from the total of the bill  not asking if I had a Tesco club card. Nor a please and thank you.

Unfortunately its developed a fault. I rang your helpline who were great and they told me to take it back to store and they would exchange it. I took it back this morning and a member of staff at your customer service desk took the details and told us to  go upstairs and see if you can find one   really helpful. We went upstairs and did find one however this one was a newer model and cost more.  Because you no longer stock the old model (and from what I can see it s not on sale anymore)  you expect me to pay the difference! Whilst it was only £15 more it s the principle  the original goods were faulty. I m disgusted at the attitude I experienced as I quote  obviously it s not our fault and obviously you can t expect Tesco to pay more when it s a Tefal model . Think I will be taking my business elsewhere in future 😡😡;;;;;2016-09-24T11:39:49+0000;1474717189;2016-09-24 13:39:49;0;4;0;0;4;4;1;3;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Twice this week I ve made an online order. First time I had an order acknowledgment etc but no order.  Last night I gave it a second chance and ordered £40.25 of groceries for click and collect to be collected between 12 and 2  order acknowledged and payment taken. My stepdad has just gone to collect it to be told there is only £8 worth of groceries as the rest is not actually there and hasn t been since yesterday morning.  I d like to know the following: Why was my order accepted and payment taken if the chosen foods were not actually in stock? Why I had no notification or contact from the online ordering service team to say the chosen items were out of stock? Why are you selling items online that are actually not available?  This is twice that my time has been completely wasted and orders accepted for items that we not available to collect. I believe there are laws against that?  I personally refuse to shop with you. Unfortunately my parents are only just learning  after £80 of online orders  that you aren t worth the hassle.  I would like my questions answered and if they aren t  I will be contacting trading standards about the sale of goods online and payments taken for items you actually don t have in stock.;;;;;2016-09-24T11:35:54+0000;1474716954;2016-09-24 13:35:54;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I m 25 and had valid ID! My boyfriend however is 21 and as it wasn t his shopping nor was he carrying any of it to or near the checkout. The alcohol prompted the girl on the till to ask for ID so without a problem I presented my passport only for her to ask my boyfriend for his once i was about to pay and he walked over to help me... now unfortunately he didn t have any but as I say this wasn t his shopping and he wasn t under 18 but I assume that is irrelevant  I can understand that if it was a group of younger lads or girls next to me who I didn t know or if I didn t have ID but what if I was to try and buy this meal deal with a child of mine ? Would I be asked for ID then is that not exactly the same? You know just in case I want to get my baby drunk (I dont have a baby). I thought it was ridiculous. If he would of been putting the alcohol on the belt or clearly under 18 then I could maybe understand but when I spoke to the manager in store he insisted it was company policy clearly not the challenge 25 policy though. I was just wondering what happens if the random person behind me next time will be asked or maybe the person being served on the opposite checkout! It was just inconvenient that we had to walk to another tesco so I could buy the same deal whilst he waited outside. I m aware of the challenge 25 policy but I m pretty sure if he clearly wasn t purchasing the alcohol the cashier shouldn t be asking him for ID! I ve worked in retail and I m aware you shouldn t buy alcohol for anyone under 18 and will be asked for ID if you look under 25 and that you will not be served if you appear intoxicated however I was not aware you will not be served if there is a person under 25 within a 2meter radius who attempts to help u ?? Just embarrassing and very frustrating!

Her name was Jemma and she was working last night (23/09/16) around 18.00 on the front customer services desk.  Yesterday evening I was in Sunbury driving around with a very young hungry baby and my 3 year old son. I had been driving around and around for 45 mins and I had got completely lost trying to find a friends new flat where I was meant to be meeting my friend and husband. My mobile phone battery had died and I was struggling to find a pay phone where I could stop safely with the children. I finally saw a sign for tesco and thought they must have a pay phone so I parked the car and went in the store. I asked the security guard if there was a pay phone which he said there wasn t but this young lady heard my plea and immediately offered me the use of the store phone. I was very close to tears as I had no idea where I was  Jemma offered to use her phone to find the road I was looking for and help direct me and then even went as far as seeing if there were any spare chargers laying around that I could use for a few minutes to turn my phone on and let my husband know myself and the children were safe as we were now and hour late!  Luckily my husband answered the call from tesco and they came to rescue me and turned out I was only a few roads away!  Please pass on my thanks to Jemma I am really grateful X X;;;;;2016-09-24T08:24:06+0000;1474705446;2016-09-24 10:24:06;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

After a few minutes a lady came out of the cubical and washed her hands and went to use the handriers  before she did she asked me if it was ok and if the kids were ok with the noise. My son turned to her and said he didn t like the noise the lady said ok and didn t use the hand drier and left. I was so so grateful as it s one less battle to face  after she left I burst into tears because she was so nice and noone has ever asked before.   Turns out her name was chloe and she works there. Just wanted to say you employ some bloody amazing staff.   <3;;;;;2016-09-23T19:06:49+0000;1474657609;2016-09-23 21:06:49;162;11;176;11;198;11;10;1;40;0;162;14;0;0;0;0;0

I cannot believe that a multi site   million ££££ company would allow such a under performance of a subsidiary. Having ordered a sofa from Tesco direct on 17/09/16 and paid in full for delivery and goods. I have experienced the poorest customer service to date. And that is really saying something! I waited in 12 hours !! For a sofa that didn t arrive. After 5+ phone calls they eventually admitted it was out of stock and I would be refunded. 6 days after full payment of goods MY money is still sitting in a Tesco bank account. They refuse to confirm when I will receive a refund or if they will even compensate me for my lost day of work awaiting delivery. Well Tesco I know the  small  amount of money I paid you is probably very insignificant to you but as you are so keen to tell everyone  every little helps. I hope my money is earning you some interest in your bursting accounts.;;;;;2016-09-23T18:15:37+0000;1474654537;2016-09-23 20:15:37;2;10;2;0;12;10;1;9;4;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I asked her where my change was and she said I had only given her £1.10  I knew what money I had in my purse and knew I had given the lady a £10 and 10p.  The lady still kept insisting I had only given her a £1 coin  so I then asked her to do a till check.  The lady dissapeared for what seemed like ages  over 15minutes and when she came back a bit red in the face said I must have been right as her till was £9 up and apologised. That IS NOT good enough do you know how embarrassing it is to near enough be called a liar when you know you are right.  There were other people walking past me aswell  I was getting quite worried as that meant I would have £9 less for my top up shopping in the week and sweat was pouring off my head.  Yes I got the money back but that is not the point it was very humiliating stood at the front of the store waiting for her to come back after doing a till check.

I had pre ordered a quantity of bread rolls to be collected this morning at 10am. When I arrived at 10.05am I was told by the assistant on bakery that he would have to package up some more rolls as the ones done and put aside had been taken by other staff. Staff putting together click & collect orders. This is not good enough. Thankfully they did have more fresh rolls ready for packaging  but what would have happened if they hadn t? I do not blame the young man who then packaged some more for me  he was apologetic and it was not his fault. But I suggest other members of staff are given training and make sure they do not help themselves to reserved products in future.;;;;;2016-09-23T12:52:16+0000;1474635136;2016-09-23 14:52:16;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Happy. Always smiling. Big smile. Nice white teeth. I like her voice  soft  can t quite place it. Grey blue eyes. Not too much make-up but red lipstick (I like that). She s got lightish brown hair. Quite long. Always has it up. In a bun (I think it s called). Her yeah. That s the one. I like her. She s a little bit cuddly looking. Am I allowed to say a bit plump? It s in a nice sort of way. If she s on the check out counter I always go to her till. Even if I have to wait for the queue to go down. I think she only works part time   cos some days she s not anywhere to be seen  even if I go in several times. She ain t got a wedding ring on. Not that that means much these days! Well  anyway she has noticed that I am on an organic diet because  well she mentioned it actually. She said to me - when I was shopping last Tuesday it was  - she said to me - well sort of exclaimed it really - she said   my goodness  what a lot of healthy shopping!  So I told her about me being on this organic diet and that  and how it s made me feel tons better and about me walking a lot easier and all that. And she seemed really interested. She said she might give it a go herself. But d you know what she said after that  when I was putting me shopping into me shopping bag? Funny thing is  even me shopping bags one of them organic ones! D you know what she said? No course you don t you weren t there. She said - and she had her lovely big smile on when she said it. Looked me right in the eye she did - she said   well I must say   she said   I must say  you do look really well on it  a lot better.  Well  I ll tell you what. I was made up with her saying that I can tell you. Not just because it means me organic diet must be working. No  not just  cos of that. No  but because if she thinks I look a lot better now than I did before  it must mean she has noticed me before. You know what I mean? Well  it must mustn t it? I reckon she fancies me. Grace her name is. She didn t tell me. It s on her badge. She s really nice! PS. This is just a story. I made the whole thing up. Although I wouldn t be at all surprised if women do think I look good on me new diet!;;;;;2016-09-23T12:41:26+0000;1474634486;2016-09-23 14:41:26;1;3;1;0;4;3;3;0;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Have to say was a bit gutted...  Not half as much as my daughter who couldn t find a card for  sister  without it being bright pink or overly girly.😞 my eldest megan has actually asked me to message  the tesco  and ask why all your sister cards are so girly? Her younger sister loves dinosaurs  rolling in mud football and collecting pebbles 🤔 not sure where that has come from.  But would rather scratch her eyes out than have a girly anything at the moment..... I know it is a push to get anything dinosaur related that isn t aimed at boys... But I honestly don t have an explanation for my 8 year old why tesco seem to think all girls are girly and love pink  sparkles and fluffy cats.... The only one that wasn t overly girly was  far too grown up for Mollie  << Megan s words. We ended up ditching the sister card idea and went for a 6 spider man card.  That said I m holding out hope that you do infact sell something that would suit a  tomboy  daughter.   Could you advise on if you do sell daughter cards aimed at more tomboys? And also if you do any dinosaur clothing for girls? Xx;;;http://section.pr/;section.pr;2016-09-22T21:01:41+0000;1474578101;2016-09-22 23:01:41;4;2;4;0;6;2;2;0;2;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

It was lunch time so I looked for a place to feed her. Harris and Hoole was full so I went into Giraffe and asked if I could sit to feed my daughter. I was told no as it was a restaurant  I needed to order something. I was most shocked to be spoken to like that and quite upset as my daughter was clearly unhappy and hungry.  Feeling humiliated I went back into Tesco and asked at customer services if there was somewhere I could feed my daughter. The lady said the baby room and took me. To say I was disgusted is an understatement. It was dark  small and stank from the nappy bin. I refused to feed my daughter there and was forced to go and sit outside.   I have been using this store for years and never have I been so disappointed  upset or humiliated. Why Tesco thinks it s acceptable to feed a child in a dark smelly room is beyond me. I would like to see the Tesco staff sit and eat in there. In future I will be feeding my daughter before shopping and certainly will not be going into Giraffe again.;;;;;2016-09-22T20:11:30+0000;1474575090;2016-09-22 22:11:30;6;73;21;19;113;71;24;47;120;0;6;0;3;0;1;11;0

First of all thanks for your grocery deliveries  we ve been problem free for months & your drivers are always so polite which saves us the trek around Tesco with little ones in tow.  Sadly today we have issues though. The carrots that were delivered aren t particularly nice and look like something has been living in at least one of them (can only hope it s no longer there given the beastie phobia!) and they stink. This has also made everything that was in the bag with them stink and a bag & contents that must have been in contact with this stink aswell - to the point I d rather bin the contents than put them in the cupboard.   Is there a way to get a refund for these items? Teething baby makes a phone call to customer services slightly difficult. Thanks.;;;;;2016-09-22T20:08:16+0000;1474574896;2016-09-22 22:08:16;1;7;1;0;8;7;1;6;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I queried this with staff who agreed I was right and the ticket was incorrect. They tried to find the correct size box for me but after waiting over 20 minutes I was told there was nothing they could do as the ticket was a  head office mistake . The manager  Andy  refused to compensate and give me the 4 cans that I was owed. Really  with the profits made by Tesco I honestly thought you could have made up the 4 cans and I would have left a happy customer. This time I just feel like I ve been treated unfairly and I ve paid for something I didn t get. It s left a bad taste!

I ve had my foot op and I m now home and I m very very disappointed.  This is not the level of customer service that I expect from TESCO.  Appalling customer service from Tesco Direct. Ordered a new Sim- only mobile on 18/9 for delivery 20/9 at my local Click and Collect store. on 20/9 I get an email saying sorry  it s been delayed  will be there tomorrow (today). So today I waited and waited for the confirmation e-mail - nothing - not even another  sorry email . I decide to check online to see what has happened to my order. Status says  not dispatched . So I phone customer services  wait ages to get through  she doesn t know  she ll contact the  partner company . Then I just get put through and have to go through the whole story again. Appliances Direct lady says my order isn t showing on their system so she can t help. I ask to be transferred back to Tesco Direct. I speak to a gentleman  who after a bit of investigation  assures me my phone was delivered to the C&C at 11am this morning. However  when the very helpful gentleman at the C&C tries to find my order in store  there is no sign of it. I come back home and phone the Tesco Direct customer services again & go through the security for the 4th time. After speaking to a supervisor  the customer services assistant says unfortunately there s nothing they can do as Appliances Direct are now shut until tomorrow. Now tomorrow I am having an operation and I wanted to have this phone while I was in hospital to play around with and familiarise myself with the new functions  it is a foot operation so I won t be able to walk or drive to collect this phone and it is likely I ll still be in hospital when anyone phones back to let me know the outcome. The money  of course  was taken from my credit card immediately. TESCO - this is not good enough - I went through your website because I thought it would give me piece of mind that my phone would be delivered on on the day stated. You are obviously only interested in getting my hard-earned money and not in good customer service - many companies don t debit the account until the item has been dispatched. Don t use partner companies if they can t hold up to your usual standard of customer service. Please let me know what you intend to do about my phone - i don t care which colour I get  I just need a new phone to keep me in contact with my friends while I am stuck indoors after my operation.;;;;;2016-09-22T16:28:15+0000;1474561695;2016-09-22 18:28:15;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Stock on the shelves on a number of items only have dates of 24-48 hours at best. I seem to be visiting more often buying smaller for fear of it going off. Is this a ploy to make the customer visit more frequently and boost profits? On another note  the remerchandising of the Dover store defies logic.

The lady at customer services sorted out a goodwill voucher which was a nice gesture but I still obviously wanted a refund on the out of date product I had purchased .your employee was very rude at this point and said he had given me a goodwill gesture and that was all the goodwill I was receiving .

No offence but I am  paying all this money on rent to live near the city campus at Worcester and Tescos Express (the building underneath our flats) on Foregate street are doing construction at 12 in the night?! At 1:30 we asked them to keep it down and we are met with rudeness?! We are all awake in the building and will be till 6am  apparently  as that is when we finish?!  We all have to get up early for lesson tomorrow morning and all management can do is close the door and say we were warned... when?! There was no letter through the door or any verbal warning when I was in the shop yesterday! My fellow students in the building and I are all paying  £9000 a year for our education and no one can sleep  meaning our early morning will be hard.  One of my flat mates is trying to catch a train home in the hope of getting a little sleep tonight!!! We had no warning  no letter through the door nothing  we would have understood if there was warning or maybe an explanation on why they are disturbing our sleep?!

I feel that the users of this store are being classed as undervalued shoppers. The magazine has money off coupons inside and again we are not able to access this. This store at Alver Village in Gosport is a superstore so surely it should have the magazine.;;;;;2016-09-22T01:10:03+0000;1474506603;2016-09-22 03:10:03;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

What I don t appreciate is poor customer service. I found a lovely coat in your shop (southend store) that I wanted to get the girls. There was one of each size on the rail which again i understand as the rails are only a certain size. After wandering around for five minutes to try and find someone to ask to have a look out the back for a second of the same size I gave up and went to customer services. Upon asking the lady if she could have a look I was greeted by a short  I can t leave the desk  strange thing to say I thought to myself  surely you can help your customer?? Anyway I asked if she could find someone to have a look for me. At this point I was told everyone in clothing had gone home and only they could access the area with clothing in. Again a strange response surely someone in the store can access this  isn t this what managers are for? Worse still I was then asked what the time was and upon answering 20 past nine I was told  Well if you want to go and do some more shopping there might be someone here about quarter to.  I asked how would I know who to look for only to be told   they will be around somewhere  great customer service... fed up with the less than helpful attitude of this lady I went and done some more shopping  came back and couldn t find anyone. I went back to customer services thinking I could ask the less than helpful worker (because of course she couldn t leave the desk she would be there) only to find that she wasn t there... she was wandering round another part of the store. I regularly spend a lot of money in tesco not only on food but many items for my girls including baby food nappies and clothing. Is this the sort of service that tesco pride themselves on? Am I a valued customer? Is it really that difficult to have an assistant help me when trying to make a purchase? I have been at work all day and can only shop this late as I don t have any other spare time to do this. Needless to say it was not a pleasant experience and you have lost out on a dual purchase for your poor customer service and it makes think why would I return to your store if this is how I am treated!!!!;;;;;2016-09-21T21:35:54+0000;1474493754;2016-09-21 23:35:54;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

As a new mum I was at my local Lesmahagow store with my 3 week old baby on Friday the 16th of September  this was one of my first outings with my baby alone. We happily went round the store but by the time I got to the check out my baby was getting very distressed and as a result so was I.  Your staff could not have been any more helpful as one woman that works there called Audrey (who I only realised after she had helped hadn t even started her shift yet) approached me and offered to put my shopping on the check out for me  whilst another rang them through. Another woman called Fiona then came up and helped me with my baby  as a first time mum I was very happy to welcome any help being given to me.  Not only did they help me in store they both walked me to my car and helped me load  my groceries. I feel they were very friendly and went over and above their duties to go out of their way to help me. I was just wondering if there was any way these 2 individuals could get the recognition they deserve.  All staff in the Lesmahagow branch are very friendly but these 2 ladies were fantastic to me and certainly made a time that was very stressful for me much easier.  I think they done a fantastic job and should be praised for the kind lovely helpful ladies they are  they are an absolute credit to your store. I would appreciate it greatly if they could some how get this message or inform me as to how i can contact the specific store myself with a customer comments scheme of some form.   Thanks again for all your help 😀  Linsey;;;;;2016-09-21T19:42:05+0000;1474486925;2016-09-21 21:42:05;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Well it s arrived an hour late  the delivery guy didn t knock on my door but slammed my letter box twice waking my twin five year olds up (who have school in the morning) and was rude to me when I asked him if in future he could knock on the door rather than slam the letterbox! AND there are STILL items missing from my shopping!!! Great customer service Tesco! Well done! 👏🏻👏🏻;;;;;2016-09-21T18:16:48+0000;1474481808;2016-09-21 20:16:48;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Ordered a new Sim- only mobile on 18/9 for delivery 20/9 at my local Click and Collect store. on 20/9 I get an email saying sorry  it s been delayed  will be there tomorrow (today).  So today I waited and waited for the confirmation e-mail - nothing - not even another  sorry email . I decide to check online to see what has happened to my order. Status says  not dispatched . So I phone customer services  wait ages to get through  she doesn t know  she ll contact the  partner company . Then I just get put through and have to go through the whole story again.  Appliances Direct lady says my order isn t showing on their system so she can t help. I ask to be transferred back to Tesco Direct.  I speak to a gentleman  who after a bit of investigation  assures me my phone was delivered to the C&C at 11am this morning. However  when the very helpful gentleman at the C&C tries to find my order in store  there is no sign of it.  I come back home and phone the Tesco Direct customer services again & go through the security for the 4th time. After speaking to a supervisor  the customer services assistant says unfortunately there s nothing they can do as Appliances Direct are now shut until tomorrow. Now tomorrow I am having an operation and I wanted to have this phone while I was in hospital to play around with and familiarise myself with the new functions  it is a foot operation so I won t be able to walk or drive to collect this phone and it is likely I ll still be in hospital when anyone phones back to let me know the outcome.  The money  of course  was taken from my credit card immediately. TESCO - this is not good enough - I went through your website because I thought it would give me piece of mind that my phone would be delivered on on the day stated. You are obviously only interested in getting my hard-earned money and not in good customer service - many companies don t debit the account until the item has been dispatched. Don t use partner companies if they can t hold up to your usual standard of customer service. Please let me know what you intend to do about my phone - i don t care which colour I get  I just need a new phone to keep me in contact with my friends while I am stuck indoors after my operation.;;;;;2016-09-21T17:07:26+0000;1474477646;2016-09-21 19:07:26;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ve been a loyal customer for over 40 years. No longer.  The products I used to buy every week have now been discontinued  even though they were popular  admitted by one store manager. I can buy them on line if I like. No thank you. If you buy stuff on  line  you get no choice as to what they deliver to you  as found out from experience.  Sorry  we do not have that item  but we sent you this instead  and we have charged you for it!   Sell by dates are getting shorter and shorter and the fresh food is anything but! Fresh that is! And offers are anything but offers. A friend posted this today (I m sure she won t mind me passing this on.)   Really annoyed with TESCO S. Last week I needed to buy my usual Quaker Oats but noticed that the price had jumped from £1.09 to £1.99 (nearly double). They had then put a  special offer  notice next to it of 2 for £3. I m sure that you don t need me to work out the maths for you. Obviously  I didn t buy it  but went to Morrison s where I bought it for £1 a packet  (cheaper than Tesco s normal price). Today  I went again to Tesco s to do my weekly shop and just thought that I would check the price of the Quaker Oats. It was still on the  so-called  offer. Upon mentioning it to a member of staff and telling them that it was a total RIP-OFF and a CON  the answer was   Yes  I know. They all do it!  Come on  TESCO S. This is not fair on your loyal customers and do you really think that we are all totally gullible and stupid? How many other items  (some probably far more expensive)  have had the same  special offers ? STOP RIPPING-OFF your customers!   Ive given up now and shop at Lidl most of the time....;;;;;2016-09-21T16:32:51+0000;1474475571;2016-09-21 18:32:51;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

On the main page I was presented with the option of 3 e coupons  to be used on 3 different shops  the first one being  TDX-WFRX  for £5 off a £40 spend and valid to be used at the checkout. My husband has just been to our local Tesco store in Burnley and was told by an assistant that it was a scam. But as these coupons are appearing on Tesco s own site we are wondering how it could possibly be a scam. Please could you verify whether these coupons are genuine. If they are genuine can they only be used on line or is it possible to print them out and use them in store.;;;;;2016-09-21T16:17:53+0000;1474474673;2016-09-21 18:17:53;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

At approximately 13:30 I went to your Tesco express store on 780-790 Bath Rd  Hounslow TW5 9SL. The member of staff whose behavioural issues I have already raised with Tesco was once again manning the till; there was a G4S man working under the till; and all tills was closed for what would be a few seconds; this cashier who did have a name badge on this time (Beatrice) said to the people waiting at the front of the queue  its not working  and pointed to the self service; I then approached the till and pointed to the bottle of whiskey and said that i would pay on self service. the abrupt reply from beatrice was  its not working  i said yes i know if u hand me the item in question ill pay for it on self service; again the abrupt reply was  its not working  at this point the manager ok d her to use the till she in her usual rude manner said  which one u want  I named the brand and said i would like the small one; she automatically picked the biggest bottle and i again reiterated  the small one  this time she picked the second largest; I realised at this time she was being difficult on purpose (which coincidently was why I complained about her the first time around) I had to correct her a third time at which point she complained that I had not told her the exact volume of the bottle; I was beginning to loose my cool with her at this point and said  you are being difficult as usual  I than looked at the manager and said  are you the manager  to which he replied  yes ; I said to him this member of staff has an attitude problem and is consistently rude to customers; at this point beatrice chimed in and said  NO U ARE RUDE!!!  i looked at the manager and said  are u just going to stand there mate or do u have something to say  he just kept starring blankly in front of him as if he didn t know what to do; I said to beatrice  i will complain to the head office about this  and her blatant reply was  you can complain as much as you like ; the manager till standing there pretending he can t see or hear anything. Normally i would hand he money to the cashier but i was so furious with her and the lack of intervention from her manager that i dropped the cash on the till rather than handing it over  beatrice at this point again in an aggressive manner said  don t you throw money at me  clearly she doesn t know what throwing money at someone or something really means; i d had enough of her by this time and said to manager could you at least come over and serve me; which he did. having raised a similar issue with a manager in the branch before; the manager who on this occasion was stocking just briefly looked at me and said  yeah sorry bout that  and than turned and started stocking the shelfs again and only agreed to speak with beatrice when he was contacted by your head office about the complain; however this time round it was even worse; the manager was right there and made no attempt to intervene and take over the situation at any point (i didn t get his name but would describe him as a young asian guy wearing thick rimmed glasses; there are about 7 other shops in the immediate vicinity of your tesco who are family run businesses and realise being rude to customers will hit your profits; your shop however is staffed by rude cashiers driving business away and a useless management who seems unable to do anything about them; and since you are employing and paying this person to be the face of tesco I will make sure that you don t only loose out on getting my money but also share this experience with as many people as possible to insure you loose thousands of pounds because of this one member of staff.";;;;;2016-09-21T13:39:39+0000;1474465179;2016-09-21 15:39:39;0;13;0;0;13;13;3;10;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Used to buy a 90p bag of fruit (mainly melon with a few other cheap fruits) but have now discovered that you have doubled the size of the bag and knocked the price up to £3 whilst adding a few (and I mean a few) tiddly little sour looking strawberries. This is the way you seem to be going. Your profits and sales fell so you took it upon yourselves to simply increase prices whilst stating that you were decreasing your offers to concentrate on reducing your fresh prices. This apparent reduction in offers seems to have spread to your everyday cheaper items which you are jiggling with to try and fool people. Uncle Ben microwave rice used to be a regular offer at 99p yet now the offer is buy 2 for £3. You got rid of Bisto ready meals that were 99p and replaced them with you own (very low meat but not bad tasting) meals. You are slowly but surely bringing yourselves up to the price point that Sainsbury s have driven me away with and Lidl s is starting to once again become an attractive option. Your apparent sales increase of late is  in my opinion  driven more by price increases than by a new formula that is winning you back customers.

I purchased an Xbox One S from Tesco Brooklands  I paid some of the cost in Tesco clubcard vouchers and some on my debit card. I ordered this at the click and collect counter. The transaction was voided twice! I have 2 transaction void receipts. The Lady at the Click and Collect counter assured me that the money would not come out of my account as I had the voided receipts. Today I get an email from my bank saying I have no money in the account. On further investigation on my part I see the transaction has come out 3 times from Tesco. I have spoken to a gentleman in Customer Service this morning at 11am - he said he would call me back.  Still no call!!!! I have then called back Tesco 3 times today and gone over the story as many as well! As no-one was calling me!! Tescos are now telling me that the money is being refunded by my bank not them.  This is not the case as my bank has authorised the payment to Tesco and the money has left my account.  No refund will be coming to me from my bank. I am out of pocket £213 today and have no money to buy food for my family tonight as a result!!! I shop at Tesco everyday and see this as very poor customer service! How are you going to resolve the situation? I have been told by Tesco Brooklands that I have to schlep over to them for them to credit me with the funds as it cannot be done over the phone!  So I have to take time out of my day  use my petrol and valuable working day time to rectify a Tescos mistake.  They have said they can offer me £20 voucher and a bunch of flowers as a way of apology. I do not see this as good enough.   Seeing as I have no money today to buy food  have DDs going out of my account which may not go out due to current lack of funds!   What can you do as ways of compensation?;;;;;2016-09-20T20:30:05+0000;1474403405;2016-09-20 22:30:05;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

All I wanted was a replacement of a £5 Bluetooth GPS tracking Tag purchased from the petrol station that stopped working the next day  but all I got was   how do we know you bought it from here? you could have bought it from Morrisons or Asda for all we know   obviously if I had bought it from elsewhere I would be there asking for a replacement. I tried to explain my statutory rights as a consumer but all I got was  well I don t have any way to tell if it was bought from here so I can t do anything if you don t have the receipt or packaging . She then said if I didn t have a receipt i could show a bank statement to which I advised her that bank statements don t itemise items only what you paid  and she said well at least it would say Tesco petrol Station wouldn t it? I said yes it would but it wouldn t say what i bought  I said I ve just been to the petrol station now should I come back in a couple of days and show you that one? I even showed her my statutory rights of repair or replacement without a receipt or proof of purchase online  and she said that doesn t matter we teach our people to refuse without receipt or packaging. The thing is the packaging is universal so everywhere that sells these has the same packaging so again her argument was flawed. I asked that if i went to the citizens advice bureau what would they say  and she agreed that they would tell them to replace it but this didn t really matter as they just decide for themselves. In the end  I asked once again nicely and she agreed (on this occasion) to a replacement  but this was a very unpleasant experience over something that should have taken 2 minutes to resolve  not 3 visits and a conversation with a confrontational manager. She was already aware of the issue before speaking to me and so had already made her mind up as the staff from the Petrol station had spoken to her before I went to the store.;;;;;2016-09-20T17:36:44+0000;1474393004;2016-09-20 19:36:44;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I would have thought your own store would price match your own online store. So I go to store to purchase a lego product where it is £35 in store but same product is £27.99 on Tesco direct. To be told I have to order via click and collect and they won t sell it for the same price. I understand you don t have to price match other companies but your own company is a joke! Before you tell me you are two different companies like I was just told in store that won t wash as you are quite happy to deliver products online to store to be picked up so not that much different in companies are you.;;;;;2016-09-20T17:14:37+0000;1474391677;2016-09-20 19:14:37;1;13;1;0;14;13;5;8;4;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

After dressing my three month old and actually managing to get out the door (any new mum will understand to get out the door is no mean feat)  I arrive at Tesco Aldershot feeling accomplished and ready to face the dreaded weekly shop  I get out my car to discover firstly the nearest single baby seat trolley to put my daughter in is a half mile away at the other end of the car park... So... I pull my sleeping child out of her car seat walk a marathon across the car park to get the trolley only to discover it s dirty and has a wonky wheel but at this point Iv just walked the length of the car park to get it so I carried on. Walking into the store I was on the look out for a different trolley I managed to find one (also dirty) but it s a double so it was about the size of a boat (I only have one small child) I placed her in it anyway as I thought it might be better and I just want to get shopping... it s no better still has a wonky wheel and still dirty but at this point I m getting fed up and my child is getting ratty with all the swapping seats. I got in and managed to get round the veg but after nearly taking out a bunch of other shoppers and my daughter becoming sea sick as the boat was such a bumpy ride I decided to ask the security guy to see if he could find me another trolley (he was the only staff member I could find) He came back with a double trolley also dirty and also with a wonky wheel!   Yes this is the third baby trolley I m on now!  At this point I m really fed up I just wanted to get in do my shop and get out  when I told the security guy that it s just as bad he advised me I just needed to walk around the store slowly.... Are you kidding me... I don t have time to pee by myself let alone walk around the store slowly!  I then found a Tesco staff member and told her it was unacceptable and asked her to remove the items from the self scanner as at this point I ve had enough and wanted to leave.   She arranged for me to speak to the duty manager who offered to find me another trolley ...my answer was NO!  He did apologise and advised me they should have new baby trollies arriving in store soon very helpful when I need to shop today!  The duty manager then turned to a cashier and asked her if they had any new baby trollies to which she stared blankly back at him 👌  I left the store with no shopping and feeling very deflated me and my husband are now very hungry this evening.  Thank you Tesco for a thoroughly  disappointing and frustrating trip 👍;;;;;2016-09-20T17:02:51+0000;1474390971;2016-09-20 19:02:51;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

(I ve lived in Stoke).  I witnessed (again) with my own eyes a woman leave a Tesco trolley outside my house (an able bodied woman riding a bike(yeah a bike(yeah she was pushing a trolley with a bike(How? Science B****))). Anyway  as I drove passed her to park my car  she looked a bit shifty  like she had been caught doing the deed  like the way someone looks when they ve been caught eating all your jaffa cakes that you bought for yourself and not you MIKE   I was sure that as I parked my car in the garage she would take it back.  PLOT TWIST: She didn t.  I watched her bike off into the sunset  with 2 bags on her handles. 2 Bags. TWO.BAGS. Probs some Fig biscuits (Tescos)  Loo roll and a copy of Grazia.  I ve setup closed circuit surveillance cameras at the perimeter of my house to catch this crazed animal walking passed. I ve also called Bill Oddie (an experienced bird watcher) to try to get a glimpse of who it was. Employing Oddies years of Birding  Sleepless nights and microwave meals (Tescos) for 2 have led to nothing. Apart from the terrible nausea (don t ask)  the only thing I caught was my gf going to the gym (again) with a very close friend of hers (male).  Bill has since quit birding.  It s been there ever since last Tuesday. Just sitting there  like a dead badger (minus the smell and general mess that a dead animal makes). It s now a scene of rage and anger  greeting me every morning I go to work  and every time I walk to Tesco PLC.   I wake up sweating  like a scene from hollywood when someone jolts forward out of bed with sweat dripping down their face  wishing I had never witnessed such a callous disgusting act.   I wonder sometimes  if I should go out and take in that badger and keep it as my own. But I know that the stench of it  I mean trolley not badger  would reek out my usually clean cream cotton curtains and cushiony carpet. (Usually Febreezed(Asdas (sorry was closer to work)).   I also wonder if on the 5 ocassions I ve walked to tescos since  that I should just push it there. But the thought of letting myself forgive her  really gets on my wick.  Anyway  I digress. I was just wondering how much your Tiger bread is?  Kidding  can you get one of the lads to come get it? (trolley). It s located at CB19GJ.

They said if you disagree we ll call the police.  I said sure go ahead.  They called the police and the police spoke to the Tesco manager and myself and told me Tesco had every right to refuse.  Okay I thought I ll call Sky. Before I did this the manager tells me that it s people of my ethnicity that have been coming into Tesco with fake vouchers!  I couldn t believe what he said.  He happily repeated it.  I m British Asian. The manager was black.  I would never dream of stereotyping him.  I spoke to Tesco customer services who rang the store. The manager said because he was a black man I should understand what he meant. Not impressed!!;;;;;2016-09-20T09:08:16+0000;1474362496;2016-09-20 11:08:16;0;9;0;0;9;8;2;6;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

But after this evening I m now thinking twice.  I bought some of your gluten free choco nut pillows. Which is definetly not krave.  This states in big letters  Gluten free  on the front.  Yet.... On the side. In small writing. States that it might not be suitable for celiacs as it contains oats.   Unfortunately I didnt read this until after I ate it and now am on a night shift with a stomach like a pregnant chihuahua and an explosive bottom.   Please can you change your policy to write in BIG LETTERS whether is is suitable for celiacs or not. To save my bottom and possibly many others who are newly diagnosed and love to eat cereal.   Kind regards a very bloated celiac sufferer;;;;;2016-09-20T00:47:19+0000;1474332439;2016-09-20 02:47:19;1;7;1;0;8;7;2;5;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was going to purchase this online but since they were charging a £3 delivery fee I thought I d just pop to the store as it s close anyway. Luckily it was in store but charging £26?! I asked customer service and apparently there s a different price for items in store and online - is that really the case? If so  that s £6 difference from your online and in store cost making it a 33% markup which took me by surprise. So does this mean you mark up all your products in store by 33%? Surely if I can find the product instore I should just be able to pay the price advertised as you re just matching your own website? Is it not bad customer service for me to inconveniently go back home  purchase the product you already have in store and come back to pick it up?;;;;;2016-09-19T17:53:32+0000;1474307612;2016-09-19 19:53:32;0;6;0;0;6;6;4;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

They said they would credit the card and it would be available within the hour. This morning my husband tried it when he went shopping and lo and behold it was still empty!

I feel now after several mails and posts I can skip the formality of using your full name and abbreviate. I wanted to let you know things have taken a more sinister turn. As you know from one of my other correspondence it was my sons birthday party on Friday night. The Mattresses I have accumulated due to your incompetence were stored in my unborn babies room. I had told the kids to stay out of said room. Anyway  today my friend contacted me to say her 5 year old daughter hasn t returned home from school. After a mass panic and a confession of hide and seek in the babies room from my son we found  chaniqua  huddled under a fallen mattress. She s been there 3 days!!!!!! Luckily she said she slept well so kudos to you on quality. I was telling my journalist pal about your idiocy on my wall and she mentioned I should perhaps play you at your own game  so here goes.... You sent me 2 mattresses that didn t fit and a third that did for a bed I couldn t use for 4 weeks. I had to keep buying the mattresses for a bed I couldn t use because you won t refund until collection. Your collection courier wouldn t collect because a 27 week pregnant lady couldn t wrap the mattresses. You had me spend days chasing you and so far all responsibility has been placed on me despite your admission that it was incorrect web details on your site that caused this. Still no refund  still full of mattresses and still angry! So  I now start backdating you fees I have accumulated. 1) a packer usually makes £8.11 an hour accounting to JSPlus website. I ll pack the mattress regardless of my health and body shape but I ll invoice you an hours pay. To store items in a rental storage it costs £22.50 a week according to easy store. I ve been storing your stock now for 4 weeks and so that s a further £90 you owe me. You have kept my money for such time also and so I will also be charging interest as of tomorrow. Each correspondence according to my pal who is a solicitor would have cost me £35 had I not paid my Tesco card bill. So I shall also be working out how much I ll charge for emails and posts.  I appreciate that at times there s a jovial tone to my mail. This is due to the fact I am hormonal and fear for public safety if I don t stay calm. But don t misunderstand me  I am seriously  unstable and ragged with rage! I killed a wasp today T  and I enjoyed it! This is on you! A woman complains on your site about her little kids not getting free fruit as she shops and you re straight in there with an apology. I complain that you re withholding my money for items I didn t order  refusing to collect them unless I exert myself in pregnancy and yet NADA! Don t make me use my minority card (I m ginger) because you re pushing me to it  T! Did I also mention I m a stress eater? If this carries on I ll also be charging you for a whole new wardrobe as I m stuffing my face to cope! Yours  seriously peed off now  Mel of Burnley!;;;;;2016-09-19T14:15:51+0000;1474294551;2016-09-19 16:15:51;6;4;10;3;17;4;4;0;8;0;6;1;0;3;0;0;0

Baby bok choy would sell well loose (no need to pack) and is so quick  simple and tasty. Also our local Tesco  superstore  only gets boring frozen fruit and veg. e.g. All the food papers say that you sell frozen avocadoes and other interesting products  but someone at head office seems to have decided we are a bunch of chavs who exist on junk food and don t cook from scratch.;;;;;2016-09-19T14:15:41+0000;1474294541;2016-09-19 16:15:41;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I usually go on a Monday morning after coming back from the clinic but I can never get a trolley. I have been able to get transport on 2 Thursday s and was able to do some shopping  though one of the times the trolley ran out of power half way round and one of the staff pushed me back. Is it company policy that the stores can only have 2 mobility trolleys because it seems so. When I enquired when would it be repaired nobody seemed to know.

Unfortunately I had a fall whilst I was there and have fractured my ankle. Your staff were fantastic  from trying to make me as comfortable as possible including one staff member offering her jacket to keep me warm  phoning for an ambulance  trying to keep my spirits up through the pain and most importantly helping comfort my upset children  wiping their tears and giving them a cuddle and a bit of reassurance. They were a credit to Tesco especially and I will definitely be attending future events once I m back on my feet  but will try to be a bit more careful next time!;;;;;2016-09-19T13:09:35+0000;1474290575;2016-09-19 15:09:35;1;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

This weekend however my husband took me away Friday night so I booked my delivery for Sunday AM instead of my usual Saturday AM (or so I thought I had). We arrived home roughly about 6pm Saturday only to have the police knock at the door 5 minutes later. I had only booked my delivery for Saturday AM by mistake and the driver had tried to deliver to me 3 times without success. As I am always there to welcome them  they found it out of character and phoned the police as they were concerned for my welfare! I didn t really pay any attention to my phone the whole weekend and completely missed the reminder text and my phone was off most off Saturday so missed the phone calls from the Store and the Police! So I charged my phone straight away so I could call Tesco and within minutes of me turning my phone on the Store rang me  checking I was OK and letting me know that my delivery is fine and they would just deliver to me tomorrow instead. Then 5 minutes later the store called me again and said that someone was on their way and would be with me within the next half hour! Considering the mess up was completely my fault  they couldn t have been any more friendly and helpful. Tesco customer service is apparently second to none! 10/10! Unfortunately  with all the commotion  I missed the lady s name that I spoke to on the phone and the chap s name that delivered my shopping so I am unable to thank them personally but Tesco - Thank you for caring. I ll be shopping with you forever!;;;;;2016-09-19T11:56:24+0000;1474286184;2016-09-19 13:56:24;5;1;7;0;8;1;1;0;1;0;5;2;0;0;0;0;0

Every week i shop at tesco... this week my dad decided to do my an order online due to financial problems i have had this week... so it was meant to be here between 12-1 pm... it got to 3pm so i decided to ring... lovely polite woman answered... was really helpful and told me thag delivery was delayed due to lack of staff.. i said not a problem as long as it will be here today... she said she would ring me back... she didnt which is fine cause 4pm came and i rang back again. .. got told it would definately be here today.... so 6pm came around baring in mind... i have two young children no food in my house at all not sufficent enougj for tea anyways... so my partner had to run to the shop to get there tea .... more money wasted as if the shop that we ordered had of arrived we wouldnt of had to spend money that to be honest we couldnt afford to.spend ... but anyways so they had there tea put them.to.bed... half 7 came... my sister rang them.at this point. .. oh it was a failed delivery... no it wasnt i have been sat in ALL DAY unable to take my kids out on a lovley day out on a sunday which i had planned ... so i had.to.let them down... as i was sat waiting all day for my food shop that then has been told it wont arrive till tomorrow.... between 11 and 12... so tesco i ask you this what are my kids meant to have for breakfast  .... so now ive.had to trail to the shop late at night to get myself some.tea and somestuff in for breakfast soo pleassee tell me why is this acceptable.? I always praise tesco its my favourite store... but today has really infuriated me... the lack of communication between your staff and your customers i shouldnt have to ring 4 times in total today. And ive now spent over 30 quid and 2 unnecessary journeys to the shops. I really do feel let down.  I booked the shopto be delivered between 12 and 1 today for a reason !!!!!!!!!;;;;;2016-09-18T20:06:04+0000;1474229164;2016-09-18 22:06:04;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Following an incident that could have seriously injured my child today at this place  I have contacted the community police team and schools in the area regarding these children. They are using Tesco Ingleby Barwick as a socialising area with total disregard of how their stupid action today could have injured my child  and they may intimidate other potential customers.  It is not the first time I have encountered problems at this store regarding children hanging around  do you have no security or CCTV to ensure they are not there causing problems? I do believe tesco own the surrounding land  so whose responsibility is it to ensure customers feel safe when they shop?;;;;;2016-09-18T19:35:33+0000;1474227333;2016-09-18 21:35:33;2;3;2;0;5;3;1;2;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Today I went shopping with my baby and 4 year old in tow alone  which is stressful enough as it is but for good measure my 3 month old decided she wanted to be carried as we were nearing the end of our shop. We headed straight for the till where i started one handed loading all my items onto the belt and my 4 year old nearly had a breakdown because we forgot the cake mix 😣 Brian sensed the stress and impending breakdown from said 4 year old and asked someone to grab it for me 👍. With that Sally and Sarah came over took over the unloading and packing from me and Sarah even helped me to the car loaded it in the boot and put the trolley away. They were all amazing and a great credit to Tesco 😇 from now on Tesco Mayflower will always be my first choice.

She displayed some strange behaviour trying to stare at my eyeballs which made me feel quite uncomfortable. It took me longer to pack my bags as she kept distracting me by chatting about how her chipped nail varnish was irritating her. It didn’t take me long to figure out what was going on. Especially when I observed the slapdash way she gave me my change  checking it only once. She wasn’t autistic like me  she was neurotypical. She must have been a high functioning neurotypical seeing as she had a job. Tesco make me proud offering these opportunities to neurotypical people. Neurotypicals deserve an equal chance in life and employers like Tesco help them by providing it. Who knows how her life would have turned out if Tesco hadn’t given her a chance? I have neurotypical people in my family and Tesco have given me hope for their future.

I have anxieties and had a panic attack  it took about half an hour to drive to the tesco  and i still felt on the verge of tears upon arrival. I had my children in tow  my 3 year old son who causes trouble whenever he can like any other child  and my 8 year old daughter who is autistic. I asked at customer services if someone could help us with our shop today as I had no carer with us and we d just had a horrible experience elsewhere. They were amazing! Our list wasn t a long one  and Sam was very patient as we perused DVDs and books and bits that weren t listed. She got the kids involved with choosing things and helping  and when the children had had enough the rest was found quickly. She opened a new till so there was no queueing to pay  and found us someone to help us to our car who was also an absolute star.  We have just reached home and my eyes are once again on the verge of tears  but this time ones of gratitude.

Surely if the world don t have a problem with people wearing pyjamas in public then surely you shouldn t and therefore  you should allow people who unfortunately have no clothes and subsequently need to wear their pyjamas and fake ugg boots in your stores whilst they shop.

On every occasion we have left empty handed with a very sad little boy to deal with. You see  he always finds the toy he wants (wwe figures) but everytime we take it to the check out it gets taken away as there is no record of it on your system!! Why is this? Why do you continue to have them on the self if they can t be sold?  On these 3 occasions  we  have left the store without much of an explanation other than  sorry you can t have it!   However today was different. My sister took my son in to purchase a figure as a gift whilst I stayed in the car with my sleeping baby. 10 minutes later they returned to the car empty handed once again and my son was extremely upset. The man at the customer service desk had told them there was no record of it therefor it could not be sold. When my sister questioned why it was on the self with a security sticker on he said that it shouldn t be there.  I returned straight away with my son seeking a better explanation and we witnessed the same man returning the toy to the self. Once again we picked it up and went back to the check out only to be told we could not purchase it. After refusing to leave without it a very helpful man called Nathan who works there was able to find a barcode on his phone and sell us the toy. WHY DON T ALL THE STAFF KNOW HOW TO DO THIS!! Do you have a better explanation as to why this happens every time?  #thankgoodnessfornathan;;;;;2016-09-17T19:19:36+0000;1474139976;2016-09-17 21:19:36;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We had been really wanting some for days. So I made the pretty long journey after the need became too great today to find - for the fourth time in a row - there were none left! 😨 there weren t even any strawberry flavour ones left which are our back-up grapes of choice.  The only ones left were the tropical flavour  which happened to not even taste remotely tropical.  Our hopes have been crushed and we are extremely sad 😢 I hope you can rectify this issue as Mummy is grumpy at her lack of Candy Floss grapes and Willow will not eat any others 😮;;;;;2016-09-17T17:10:54+0000;1474132254;2016-09-17 19:10:54;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I understand that I was a bit mixed up and got my times wrong  I arrived at the store at about 3.55pm  thinking it was open until 5pm. I parked in a parent & child bay on the underground car park and could see a security guard by the door (please bear in mind how close these spaces are to the door)  I then proceeded to take my 13 month old little boy out of his car seat and carry him (along with my empty shopping bags and baby change bag ect) to the trolley bay. I placed my boy I  the child seat and could see the security guard looking over. He watched me spend a fair few minutes adjusting the straps on the seat so that my baby was secure  I then pushed him over towards the entrance so that I could do my shopping  only to be told by the same security guard that the store was now closed and I couldn t come in! I said I thought it was 5pm and he said no it was 4pm  so I asked him why he didn t tell me this before instead of watching me struggle and spend ages securing my boy to the trolley? His reply was that he didn t know if I was coming into store or not! If I had parked there and was strapping him into the trolley  was it not blatantly obvious? I was not impressed! I think anyone with any common sense would have at least shouted over to me and not let me carry on!;;;;;2016-09-17T15:08:40+0000;1474124920;2016-09-17 17:08:40;2;5;2;0;7;5;4;1;3;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Phoned them this morning to say why have I been given two different times and they said to call if the person isn t here between half 1-2 but really the afternoon appointment is between 12:00pm and 4:00pm. I have at around 2pm called they have now said it would be within the next two hours and that I would get a phone call 30 minutes before the person was due to arrive. At 15:49 and the fitter has just got here. There was no 30 minute notice phone call. But not within the 9:00am-12:00pm time slot that i was originally told by the customer service!

I have spent 30 minutes on the phone to your  help centre  to try and purchase a television from you as my local store can not do this. After trying to buy on line and registered is was told I was already registered so submitted an forgot password request..got sent an email the postcode didn t work??? Rang the call centre got told to try entering Tesco@ and two numbers of choice.. didn t work as saying my postcode didn t match then rang again gave all my details and was told i have an account but was only asked my name number and first line off address which I gave from being born (which is four btw!) and was told that the account was set up in 2007 and again reiterated the 1st line of address (should know bought it in 2003 until 2013!) Was told it was wrong. Asked if was the same town i had mentioned and was told to email for a freedom of information and pay £10 which i explained i know the Data Protection Act and as I work in a call centre and questioned if i had had club card account then the details have been registered wrong  i was told that could not happen so asked to speak to a manager but the call handler started to give me the freedom of info request email address i stopped him and asked for the call to be escalated to it was the person immediately asked for my post code and confirm my name and the address in lived in 2007. Again after explaining that all i was trying to do was buy a telly from you again the call got transferred...which again i had to go all the information again through security questions and then told i did have an account never used and had no points but they could only put the purchase through as anonymous but to have make sure i have someone over 18 with me (i am 33 btw).

I have 23 x £10 gift card vouchers and was trying to use them as past payment of this laptop. It took me 40 mins the first time and as there was a balance left to pay  I was trying to use my debit card. It wouldn t go through so i called the Tesco direct and got a very rude man  eventually he told me to try a different browser an have another go. If it didn t work  then call back. I tried again (another 40 mins) and it still didn t work. I phoned back spoke to another unhelpful man who said i could order over the phone. He put me in touch with another person  for me to be told  that as it was coming from one of  your partners   then I couldn t use the vouchers!!!! How disgusting - nothing in the payment section says that!! The other unhelpful people didn t tell me that!!! I assume as i am buying from  Tesco Direct   the cards should be valid. Never again will i attempt to buy from you!!! You are a total waste of my time;;;;;2016-09-17T10:13:57+0000;1474107237;2016-09-17 12:13:57;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ve been a loyal customer for many years and have always had great service with excellent reliability. But this week you ve ruined it all. I ordered a dyson Hoover last weekend. Started with an issue with your computer that wouldn t accept my vouchers on line. After 4 hours over two days and talking to 3 different staff members it finally got sorted and was guaranteed it would be at my nominated store on Monday. NO - Tuesday No - Wednesday No - Thursday No - definitely be with you Friday you guessed it No!!!! I ve spoken to 3 more members of customer service. 2 member of staff at the store have also spoken to people. With no sign of my Hoover. The issue on Monday was yodel couldn t find the store as the postcode didn t match. It baffles me that you don t know the address of one of your own stores!  It s now sat in a warehouse in Bristol probably getting battered and bashed.  You have my money I just want the Hoover I ordered. The only thing I d say is the staff you have  have been lovely but that doesn t give me my order which you actually say will be with you the next day if ordered by 5pm. So how is it its now a week!!! Come on tesco sort it out.;;;;;2016-09-17T08:21:14+0000;1474100474;2016-09-17 10:21:14;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Just tell them to be more careful when talking about or making faces about customers. You never know who is watching. I have removed the names.  Treating myself to a cuppa in Tesco  watching the staff and wondering how much customer service training one has had!!   Some of the people in that Tesco cafe need to learn customer service  especially the one in black with the scarf round her neck. If you are going to make faces to other staff members about a customer  at least wait till the customer is out of the way. I felt for that poor woman.  So rude!!! No need for it!   Tesco Maybe the look was given because the Downs girl dropped her toast. That table was enjoying themselves and probably had more manners in all of them put together than the bossy boots in black had in her little finger.

I needed milk and deodorant  plus I wanted to purchase a new Xbox one game.  As a disabled customer usually in a wheel chair I like to go late at night  when it is not busy  therefore it s easier to get around  with hardly any people there to have to weave in and out of. Tonight looked very dead. so I thought I would try my crutches. HUGE MISTAKE. I got my milk and deodorant picked up my game and headed for the checkout. I was knackered walking that far  but with my condition it is a real feat but I have to try.  At the check out I was told that I could purchase the milk and roll on but for the game I had to get it at customer services. Not very happy that had to walk more i started my journey  as I got there the check out runner said  you will have to go to music and video department desk for that  I have just called him. (This is the other end of the store!!!) I asked if I had to.  yes  I was told. And with that they left me. So off I went. Got there with a real struggle. I was in a lot of pain and now not happy to be back where I started  knowing I was going to have to walk all the way back. I wished I had got my wheelchair out the back of the car now. No where to sit I stood waiting in pain. Still unable to purchase the game I wanted. No one came. A few minutes passed so I pressed the bell for assistance. Nothing!! No one!! I pressed again every minute or so. I really wanted my game. Before my accident I was a very sporty person and loved playing football and basket ball now I can t so Xbox is as near as I get.  15 minutes passed and no one came!!!! I couldn t stand any longer. It s propably the longest I have stood in months. So I left the game box there and left the store!!  I am appalled that no one once offered me any help  that I was made to walk back and forth for absolutely nothing. I have really hurt myself in the process and I still have no game!!  I think this is a disgusting way to treat any customer let alone a disabled customer.   Think you need to change your company tag line from  every little helps  to  VERY LIITLE HELP    Will not be spending my money with you in future.;;;;;2016-09-16T22:34:38+0000;1474065278;2016-09-17 00:34:38;1;7;3;0;10;7;4;3;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;2;0

When he got home and tried it out he found it to be very poor quality and it s job. He has just driven the 10 miles back to the store to get a refund to then hopefully purchase a better razor while there however  when he got there the customer services desk was closed which is fair enough but he was then pointed in the direction of a manager by security and the service he received was not acceptable. He explained the issue with the razor to which the manager said well you ve used it  chucked it back in the bag and told him to come back tomorrow.   Firstly of course he s used it  he wouldn t of known it doesn t work if he hadn t tested it out. Secondly he s just just travelled half way across York to get it sorted the same day so would of liked a bit of time and respect. Thirdly I m sure any manager in store is capable of sorting a refund or exchange regardless of whether they work in customer services or not  every person who works in Tesco has a till log on.  My husband could tell the thin manager with glasses who dealt with him was not interested and so fobbed him off which in my eyes is bad customer service. This may seem petty over £12 but its more on the principle of him having travelled all that way to have to come straight home.  I look forward to your reply...;;;;;2016-09-16T21:50:15+0000;1474062615;2016-09-16 23:50:15;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Fifteen minutes later they bought the food back  onlt to find that not only were the replacement eggs still undercooked  the raw part from the previous eggs was still on the meat where the first eggs had just been scraped off.

This is perishable goods for 80 runners taking part in a 100mile run tomorrow morning at 7am.  Two minutes ago I receive a call from rob telling me no delivery as no driver and it has been cancelled.  I expressed my dissatisfaction to be told I can collect and they will offer a £10 voucher against my next order.  I don t mean to sound harsh but it s gonna cost me that in petrol to get to the store and back.  He left no information about collection  what to do  where to go  address details nothing and hung up....he couldn t get off the phone fast enough.  I have used tesco for years and always praised your staff and service  but tonight s experience so far has changed all that in a major way.

We had to wait a while at the checkout as they wouldn t scan after a couple of minutes another store assistant went to fetch a price. After another prolonged wait I was then advised these were not actually on sale yet despite the shelf being fully stocked. No replacement was offered either so I just had to leave after paying for what was actually on sale.

I ordered my shopping yesterday to come today between 2 and 3  I buy a home delivery every week and have done regularly for around 6 months and never had a problem.   Role around 3 and still no delivery? Maybe the driver is running late  half 3... no delivery  call up customer services and ask about the delivery  they can t get hold of the driver and will call me back. Get another call asking if my delivery has arrived yet  I reply no and the customer service guy doesn t  know what s happened to it. A couple of call backs later and it still hasn t arrived and they have no idea where my shopping is and offer to have it delivered  the next day. Now  normally this wouldn t have been a problem but I have a baby and not enough nappies to last the night and no food in the fridge. I can t wait till the next day. I ask for a refund and walk 20 minutes to get to my local tesco.  On arrival there a no nappies in his size so I have the get the size below because the size above is to big.   How can you just lose someone s  delivery? The whole ordeal has really put me off. I like the home deliveries because the shops are usually  to manic for me and I don t drive so big shops are easier for to do online.   I m  really disappointed  and don t understand how shopping can go missing. Hopefully the refund goes through quickly so I can get some shopping in.  Sincerely  Steph;;;;;2016-09-16T17:39:15+0000;1474047555;2016-09-16 19:39:15;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

After much deliberation my mum settled on a motoE phone than was within her bubget  when talking to the assistant and telling him the one she wanted he quoted a much  higher price saying that the price on display was discontinued last week. I asked him why it was still displayed at that price and was told he was not allowed to take it off. I replied that it was false advertising saying a product was one price and selling it at another and at least a discontinued sticker should have been applied or one saying a price change on this product.. His answer was well they are out of stock anyway but we could still get it on amazon or maybe click and collect. I m  afraid you had two very unhappy customers who took their custom to another company who sells you the product at the price it is displayed at. I really query whether this practice is legal  or if it is  is it just a ploy to let the customer choose and then hit them with a higher price. In either case it is very misleading and makes me wonder what other phone price or misrepresented as this is not the first time I have known this happen.;;;;;2016-09-16T14:17:10+0000;1474035430;2016-09-16 16:17:10;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We ordered the trampoline in July  well in advance  for his 7th birthday in August. A number of items were not included in the delivery which resulted in a devastated little boy being unable to have his trampoline birthday party.  When I rang about this I was told  that s what you get for ordering delivery  and  do you think we have time to check every box   In the next delivery some items were still not present and this continues to pose a major health & safety risk as the springs remain uncovered.   I am shocked and genuinely saddened at this service because at the core of it is a little boy who was greatly excited by the prospect of his new trampoline only to have his hopes crushed.  I have rang and messaged your company and have got nowhere. So all I can do is now ask people to like and share this status in the hope our 7year old will finally had his trampoline complete.  Please folks like and share;;;;;2016-09-16T13:48:32+0000;1474033712;2016-09-16 15:48:32;31;22;36;56;114;19;14;5;2;0;30;0;3;0;2;0;0

Couldn t find them and when I asked a manager he said they had been withdrawn because of lack of sales. Strange when for years they ve been on aisle ends used for impulse buying. I have since found out the real reason. Tesco have delayed paying their bills and the supplier has got fed up with them and stopped supplying Tesco. Shame on you Tesco for putting your profits ahead of customer choice. I did wonder why there was an alternative much larger pack of eccles cakes if it was down to lack of sales.

I notice that your British produced chicken meat is clearly labelled  a union flag is displayed prominently on the packaging and it seems you want your consumers to know that it is British.  Why do you not label the Thai chicken the same?  Is it because the public would be  put off ?

This is unacceptable! And there was NO EVIDENCE that the aisle was in fact closed. The store is 24 hours so the products the store sells are 24 hours. Were it an issue of store improvement  as we saw in other aisles  not a problem - but her attitude was vile and not something you want associated with your company.

She looked after us very well  she was very patient with us and had excellent knowledge of the products. She was on her own in the mobile part of the store and quite a lot of customers were waiting for her attention.  She remained calm  and acknowledged all customers that were waiting immediately and reassured them well  so they didn t feel ignored. She did all this whilst continuing to deal with us and didn t once rush us. She was engaging and genuine and an asset to your team.

Hi there I bought a Dolce Gusto coffee machine from you in June via Tesco Direct and after using it this morning and it working fine  it now won t turn on. Do you know how angry I get when I am lacking in caffeine?  Hubby cannot work without caffeine either so no work  no money and we will all starve to death.

I was expecting a delivery between 7 and 8pm on Saturday and it didn t arrive. We received no email  text message or email to notify us of the non-delivery. I rang and was told that the van driver hadn t turned up for work and we couldn t pick the order up ourselves because the van was backed up to the doors and nobody could access the shopping (do your vans only have one set of keys each??). It was then re-scheduled for the following day between 12 and 1pm and guess what? It didn t arrive  once again with no notification. Then we got a phone call saying that it was scheduled for 7-8pm that evening. At that point  I told the caller - a van driver - to cancel my order. I asked him if I could speak to the store manager and he said that he wasn t available. This was the Carmarthen store and we were on holiday. We d ordered our shopping to be delivered to our holiday rental because we ve had excellent service from Tesco back at home  but this was absolutely appalling. The first two days of our holiday were ruined by being messed around and still having to go and do our own shopping when we d planned a day out.   This complaint has to go further than a customer services operator  it needs to go to a manager and then further than that if there isn t a proper investigation. I have more details than given above  this is just a summary.;;;;;2016-09-15T09:29:12+0000;1473931752;2016-09-15 11:29:12;5;2;5;0;7;2;1;1;0;0;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

The pharmacist asked me if I had a card with a collection date on it  I don t because I always pick it up when i m running low. He then tried to excuse the mistake saying that they had 3 new members of staff atm. I don t think that s a good reason for my prescription slip to go AWOL. That s like saying that your care to your customers isn t important because you have new staff. The only staff member that seemed to care was a younger guy with dark hair and glasses. He checked you diary  he kept looking as I walked away  he remembered putting my slip in the re-order basket and confirmed that I had asked you to re-order it as the pharmacist seemed to want to blame me for their mistake.

I ordered a present for my sons birthday via click and collect and went to collect yesterday evening in preparation for his 7th Birthday which is today. On arrival at the Sheldon store I discovered it was closed as it had flooded due to the bad storm we had. There were no staff around to speak to and the doors were locked. After a few phonecalls my husband managed to get in touch with Gav from the store and explained the situation. He located my item and we now have one very happy boy! Sorry I don t have a surname for him but he was so nice and went out of his way to help us so I just wanted to let you know and to pass on our thanks to him.;;;;;2016-09-14T22:03:06+0000;1473890586;2016-09-15 00:03:06;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I didn t order the second shirt.  I spoke to Eloise who was very helpful checking there wasn t another shirt in the store.  Incidentally  there was no-one on duty near the computer or the changing rooms.  Eloise was working elsewhere but was happy to help.;;;;;2016-09-14T17:04:28+0000;1473872668;2016-09-14 19:04:28;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

However after seeing it online to buy  I called Tesco up who told me that none of the shops in a 25 mile radius of where I live sell it. This also means that if I was to order it online it would most likely be replaced with a normal bottle of Bailey s  which really wasn t what I was after.

Unfortunately we have had to bin them yesterday. The chocolate was fine but the ice cream inside was very gritty and really didn t taste very nice. my daughter was eating one and said it wasn t very nice and asked me to try it  it was horrible i told her to bin that one and get another but this was exactly the same?? unfortunately we don t have the box to show you the batch codes etc as we took them out the put them in the freezer. very unhappy little girl last night without her ice cream. x;;;;;2016-09-14T07:27:05+0000;1473838025;2016-09-14 09:27:05;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I walk in for a product that they didn t stock (i was told by a member of staff not eveything online was in store so fair enough) i picked up a similar product but before purchasing I specifically asked what the return policy was.. well the lady on the till had no idea on return policy (why was she on a till?) So she had to ask they guy on self checkout and he says  as long as you have your recipt your fine  the lady on the till then asked me would you like me to open it now to check if the product is correct I said  I can t do the check now but would be back in the hour if it wasn t correct  I leave thinking all is good  well the product turns out wasn t correct it does not work for me so I go back to return (1hour 10min after purchase) now I am told by the self checkout guy the lady on till has gone home and they can only do returns from 8am untill I think 10pm  I wasn t told this when I asked what the return policy was and i specifically said I would be back in the hour so I ask to speak with a manager (night manger shows up) I explain to him what happend and he is sticking to not being able to do returns at this time and that everyone in store knows the return policy but he apologises for lady who served me and says the lady might need more training  my answere to that is  cleary not everyone in store knows the policys because the lady on till had to ask the guy on self service  how can you have sumone operate a till who isn t fully trained? .. after getting no were with him I asked if he could identify the lady who sold me the product so when I do come back i can be sure the lady is told the whole policy on returns so that this does not happen to another customer.. he told me  we only have one till on at this time  and  i could give you her first name only  that was fine by me I said  thats all i want her first name   then all of a sudden he couldn t give me her name as he didn t know who she was?? He then told me  i am not in charge of her  so I asked to speak to sumone who is and he says  there is a boss higher then me  (out comes the real manager) I explained to him the whole situation and he just wasn t intrested atall he looked at the product and said  it s open I wouldn t return that even if it was the right time  then he walks off just like that! How rude!!. Now I am angry/upset with tescos because I was told when i specifically asked what the return policy was that all is good as long as i keep the recipt.. the lady on till was even going to open the product there and then (i wish I said yes now as it would be on cctv the lady opening the item).. i was sold a product that I could return but when come to return I can t!!?? How can tesco do this?? How could any retailer do this??. After being told by the manager (who shouldnt be a manger in my opinion) that he wouldn t return it even if it was the correct time and after more talking with the night manger I ask to speak again with the real manager.. I walk across to the other side of the store to speak with him and he now says  you can try and return it in the morning but I wouldn t do it  since he knows the situation as to why I am here I asked him if it was possible for him to sign my recipt or sumthing so when I do come back at the correct times I can get a refund he says  no I can t do anything like that as he would need to speak to the lady on till  (I m sorry but the lady on the till when she is asked IF she is even asked is probly going to denie anything were she could be penalised) so it becomes my word against hers?  i shouldn t be left out of pocket due to their staffs lack of knowledge on return policys and the giving of wrong information for example i said  it s like that 40 inch tv there being sold to me as a 50 inch tv it is all your staffs fault as to why I am here and have purchased the wrong product  + after being assured I can return the item opened or not that now I cant  they are basically saying that it s my fault for buying the wrong item.. im sorry but no way would I have purchased it if I couldn t return it I would have happily purchased the correct one from your online service.. I am really not happy with this  this is totally wrong of tesco.. so much for every little helps to me it feels like as little information told helps them! Very very disappointed!.;;;;;2016-09-14T01:54:04+0000;1473818044;2016-09-14 03:54:04;0;5;0;0;5;5;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I wonder if it is possible for our local tesco which is Canonmills Edinburgh to invest in one of these. Our son has non verbal autism and a learning disability  he also runs off at every opportunity and has no awareness of danger. We have had to stop taking him for shopping as it s impossible to hold onto him  push a trolley and fill it (even with 2 parents there). Carrying out the weekly shop is an important aspect of daily life which our son is being denied as it s too dangerous for him to attend as we are unable to restrain him. A firefly trolley would help to allow him to be part of this aspect of life so he can learn about the whole aspect of shopping and money 😊 Thank you Tesco - I will look out for one of these trolleys in the future.;;;;;2016-09-14T00:37:50+0000;1473813470;2016-09-14 02:37:50;2;2;3;0;5;2;2;0;1;0;2;1;0;0;0;0;0

While she was on the phone  a young man who works for Tesco was staring at them. He proceeded to speak into his walkie talkie while staring which made my daughter feel uncomfortable. Her friend finished the call and they payed for their drinks. As they went to leave an older female employee was waiting for them. She stopped them telling them the alarm had sounded - which was a lie - and said she would need to search their bags.  She gave a range of ridiculous reasons for looking through their bags from  your headphones may be an issue  to  make up could cause the problem.  They felt intimidated and as if they had no option so let her look in their bags. It was clear the young man earlier had accused them of stealing so she was checking them out.

So I carried on looking to see a van parked in one of those spots. Still looking I saw 2 other cars with people getting in or out without children. I complained to your customer service and they said unfortunately there was nothing they could do  they can t even enforce the disabled spaces. When leaving the store  a man in a sports car pulled up in a parent and child space. When I mentioned he didn t have a child he mimicked my words in a sarcastic voice. Charming way to treat a pregnant woman!! So that s 5 cars in total without children I witnessed in a quick shopping trip. Is there anything you can do about this?

I notice that your chicken sourced from Thailand is very much cheaper than UK sourced chicken  that surprises me as the transport costs must be very high. Could this be because it s cheaply produced in factory farms where chicken welfare is non existent? Can you tell me if a vet is present during the slaughter process and if Tesco monitors the whole process from hatching to slaughter  if so can you please show evidence of this?  I notice that your British produced chicken meat is clearly labelled  a union flag is displayed prominently on the packaging and it seems you want your consumers to know that it is British. Why do you not label the Thai chicken the same? Is it because the public would be  put off ? After all dog and cat is consumed in Thailand  frequently the cats and dogs are boiled or skinned alive  this does make me wonder about how the chickens are slaughtered.  Please can you explain why you import chicken from Thailand  this can t do your carbon foot print much good.;;;;;2016-09-13T20:47:13+0000;1473799633;2016-09-13 22:47:13;2;3;2;0;5;3;3;0;3;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I went in to do shopping with my mother while at the checkout the cashier was talking to another customer in bengali (I m assuming) while customers including myself where waiting to be served. The cashier started shouting falsely accusing my mother of assault claiming she pushed another customer. The manager was called down who didn t have a name badge on so I wasn t able to know who I was speaking to  he let the cashier scream and shout at my mother while changing he s story of what had happened  and wasn t to bothered to hear my mothers side. it was only the help of the security guard who told the cashier to be quite and go away because he was screaming and shouting acting in a threatening behaviour.

I used to be able to walk around the store and get the items I needed without a problem- in fact I was so good if my partner went without me and couldn t find an item I could direct him by phone as to where it was 😂 Today I spent 15 mins looking for an item and couldn t find it  I finally admitted defeat and asked one of your staff for help. The poor lad was as lost as I was and felt as frustrated as me ( probably more as I can bet he gets asked a gazillion times a day! ) Just so you know  moving items around does NOT make we want to buy the different item that s in its place. If I want to buy chili sauce  I am not going to buy baked beans instead. My 20 min trip today took nearly 45 mins. Not a happy bunny here- and neither are your staff 😠😠😠😠;;;;;2016-09-13T15:38:54+0000;1473781134;2016-09-13 17:38:54;1;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

This inconsistent approach can cause confusion as people may think a product that isn’t labelled will be unsuitable for vegans  even if it contains no animal products. I strongly urge you to label all of your own-brand products that are free of animal ingredients and animal exploitation as being suitable for vegans.;;;;;2016-09-13T15:05:31+0000;1473779131;2016-09-13 17:05:31;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

It isn t the most affluent of areas  and there s a system in place where people have to queue for reduced items  rather than fighting over them  as they are very popular.  As I was paying for my items  I noticed this happening  but what I also noticed was that some the staff were laughing at the situation  in full view if the customers. While it was an unusual situation  I couldn t help but put myself in one of the customers shoes - they can t help being poor  and I know if that had been me  I would have felt embarrassed and belittled. Please remember they are paying customers and people too! Have a word with the staff there maybe?  Acknowledgement of this post would be appreciated greatly.;;;;;2016-09-13T06:20:11+0000;1473747611;2016-09-13 08:20:11;8;7;8;0;15;7;3;4;4;0;8;0;0;0;0;0;0

I noticed an English flag on the label  presumably to denote the origin of the cow that produced the milk. That s fine.  Then I remembered some publicity you had a few weeks ago about strawberries grown in Scotland  and how Tesco had removed the Scottish flag and replaced it with a Union flag after complaints from customers.  Can you explain your flag branding policy please. I don t understand it. If I complain about an English flag on your milk  will you replace it with a Union flag  too?;;;;;2016-09-13T05:51:58+0000;1473745918;2016-09-13 07:51:58;2;5;2;0;7;5;1;4;5;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Our local tescos express has been periodically selling and then removing goats milk from stock. My mum has complained in store and written letters to managers several times before and has received them putting it back in stock just to remove it again! This has happened several times! Surely if they re going to agree to put an item in stock they should keep it in stock? The nearest other place to sell it is a drive away at the next village  hardly a convenience. I d just like to ask if it s possible to put it back in stock and permanently this time?

When I got to the till with my large trolley of shopping there was no queue  so I started putting my items straight onto the conveyer belt. The guy on the till said hello and started scanning my items as I was still putting them on the belt the other end. You can imagine the pile of stuff that was waiting for me when I went to go pack.  When I asked him for 5 bags he counted each one  then recounted them a further 2 times before handing them over to me.  The guy didn t really talk to me  he squashed my bread when he scanned it but I waited patiently whilst he took his time  especially when trying to scan the awkward items.  By the time I went to pay I had already worked it out  so I counted out my money with him  which he obviously recounted and then counted my change out two times.  But you know every moment of that was just perfect. I asked him how he was finding the job and he chatted a bit about his experience of Tesco and how they had given him an opportunity many other employers hadn t. See this guy is Autistic. As a mother of a 12 year Autistic boy this makes my heart smile. Changing attitudes teamed with employers  like you  who really do offer equal opportunities are a changing people s lives. So thank you Tesco  it was a pleasure shopping with you today.;;;;;2016-09-12T21:14:15+0000;1473714855;2016-09-12 23:14:15;109161;2652;120879;7468;130999;2605;2177;428;2951;0;108089;11155;344;40;9;7;0

Please could you like and share this post and see if we can return a special item to a close friend.   My friends visited Tesco Extra  Town Gate Retail Park on the Birmingham Road  Dudley on Friday 9th September between 6-7pm. Whilst on their way to the store her daughter was playing with her engagement and wedding ring (she has leant not to let her play with them again!). When they parked up they got out of the car forgetting their daughter had the rings. She managed to find her engagement ring but her wedding ring could not be found. It s looking very likely that the ring was lost on the car park when her daughter stood up and fell out of her dress.    They have searched and searched the car park  re visited the car park and the store several times and have left contact details with the store but as yet  the ring hasn t been handed in.   Details: 3mm ladies platinum court ring and as all wedding rings  carry sentimental value.    Please could you share and hopefully someone has found it and doesn t know who it belongs too.

On August 2nd I purchased a television from a Tesco Extra branch. As I was on holiday at the time  we didn t actually open the box until we returned home at the end of August.  My son  whom the television was bought for  used the set twice with no issues  but when he went to switch the television on for a third time - it wouldn t work. It still doesn t work. Last week I called the number on my receipt and was told that I could return the television to my local branch of Tesco Extra. However  when we returned the boxed television in to store  it became apparent that we had made a wasted journey as Tesco policy is not to exchange brand new televisions that are faulty (not what I was informed on the phone).  Instead  I had to bring the television home again and book an appointment for a repair. I am currently waiting between 9am and 7pm  have had to lose money by taking time off work  and if the repairman cannot fix the television  we have to use more petrol returning it to the store we ve already been to. I m feeling rather disappointed by all of this and don t understand why I couldn t get an exchange as I was told originally on the phone. I m losing out financially here.

Someone has to stand up to these disgusting people who run local business into the ground and offer the most disgusting service as replacement!!!   Dear Sir/Madam    I am writing to you regarding several incidents that have happened since using Tesco online shopping. I would like to request that I receive a response to this email in due course. I also wish to inform you that  so bad was the service I have received that this might take a while to explain as there are several complaints I am submitting.    After receiving the toaster item above I decided that I wasn’t keen on the style and so decided to return the item. I made a phone call and it was agreed that I could return the item to a store close by to where I work. To my knowledge I was advised to go to Cavendish Street Tesco. Upon my arrival I was greeted and told that they would not be able to refund the cost of the item in that particular store. I contacted the help centre and spoke to a lady who gave me the address for an alternative Tesco on Dean Street. Baring in mind it was my lunch break I proceeded on to the next store. When I arrived at Dean street Tesco I was then told that I was unable to get a refund due to the item being from a third party supplier. I had already been made aware that this was the case but was reassured on my original phone call that the store would take my item. I left the shop with my item still unreturned and as you can imagine rather frustrated. It was 30oc and I was running around London like a headless chicken  I had not  been able to get lunch and I was late back from work due to the situation. I returned to work and again made another phone call and was reassured that the store was in the wrong and that they would have to take the item. I returned to Dean Street Tesco a few days later with the Toaster. The same thing was relayed to me again  I was unable to return the item as the store did not have the facilities to process a refund. Again another lunch break wasted. This had been the third time that I had been to a Tesco store and turned away. I spoke with another Telephone representative who apologetically broke the news  that I had been miss informed not by one of your operators but three different members of your phone operating team told me the same thing. THREE members of your team miss informed me. All calls were logged on the system and so I urge you to listen back to all calls for confirmation of my allegation. The final operator I spoke to offered to give me an email address and contact Clever Box directly but after having wasted so much of my time already I did not see why it was still my responsibility to figure out how to get the item returned. Taking into to account the messing around I think it’s an absolute insult that Tesco did not offer to take full responsibility of the item and arrange to have it collect in the first place. After standing my ground I was offered a £10 compensation refund and an email address to contact clever box on. I’m happy to say Clever box were a lot more responsive to me than the service I had received from Tesco. They were terrified that I had been miss advised so many times and due to the previous  issues offered to except the item free of charge. They basically took the responsibility for the mistakes made by Tesco. You’ll learn this is not the first time Tesco have failed to take responsibility if you read on.     Incident No 2   28/08/2016   For some reason my Club Card attached to my account has not been updated. I made a phone on the 28/08/2016  and spoke to a representative. After being left on hold for some time I was told that I would receive a phone call back once the issue had been looked into… I’m still waiting for my club card points to be updated and I still haven’t received a phone call.       Date: Wednesday 31stth Aug 2016   Ref : 21000635   At 21.10  I received a text to say that my home delivery had been delayed and that I should expect for it to arrive between 21:00 and 23:55. I spoke to a representative that confirmed that the driver had been delayed and would be late. I was also made aware that it’s against company policy to have vehicles on residential roads after 11pm. I was also informed that if I wanted to reschedule the delivery for the following day I would be recharged for the home delivery and also the shopping. I appreciate this would’ve been refunded at a later date  but I would like to know why the responsibility of  something so beyond my control would then be put back on to me? We’re not discussing a £20 shopping bill but a little under £100 bill which I was going to be charged twice for until a refund was given. I was offered a £5 voucher as a sorry and was thanked for my patience. Now I’d like for someone to put themselves in my shoes. It’s an insult to be offered £5 when your delivery driver turns up at the front at 11:45pm. I can’t actually believe that that’s the best you had to offer. As if it’s acceptable to have someone waiting up until that time. Now I’d like to make a few points. I wouldn’t get out of bed for £5. The very foundations of our society are partly based on  presentation  punctuality and reliability and I have been failed on all three  at every point of contact during all my experiences. I actually had a phone call from the store manager who called to apologise but then proceeded to ask me if I know why the delivery driver was late? Why on earth would he be asking me? Surely the professional thing to do would’ve been to gather his information before making a phone call of apology to me. It came across like he didn’t know what he was apologising for.     I suppose you would like to know what I would like the outcome of this complaint to be. Quite frankly I’m not sure why I should have to pay for shopping that not only arrived late but broke your rules and regulations. There is no excuse for calling someone’s doorbell at that hour especially when the lady below is an elderly and very easily confused.   Please note that if I don’t get a response I will not be suing Tesco services again as I’m going to need something to rebuild my trust in a brand that has shown no sign of organisation or punctuality or respect for me. I think it’s an absolute shame that the lack of communication and customer awareness is letting the brand.     I look forward to hearing your response    Yours Sincerely ;;;;;2016-09-12T08:03:01+0000;1473667381;2016-09-12 10:03:01;0;6;1;0;7;6;3;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0

I buy these regularly and they are usually 40p. Next to them are sardines in brine or oil at 40p for 120g. So not only has the price increased by more than 100% but the contents have reduced by 25%. I have just checked the asda website and they have chosen by you sardines in tomato sauce at 40p for 120g. As I now have to go to asda for sardines  I will do the rest of my shopping there too. I know prices do have to go up from time to time  but that s ridiculous.

Fine  perhaps guidance has changed ... but then the recipe on the side of the pack tells me that I should soak the beans overnight.  Back to the cooking instructions – ‘Place the pan on the medium hob ring over a high heat’.  Yep  I have large and small rings although I would love to upgrade to a range type cooker.

Most recently I ve been told by the online customer service team that the St Austell store (from where our online shopping is despatched) is no longer stocking aubergines. Fortunately aubergines  and other items no longer available at Tesco  are stocked at our local Morrison s and Aldi - so when our delivery saver runs out in November we won t be renewing.

Until recently  they stocked a couple of items in the  Free From  ice cream range (they used to only have the choc ices  but for a while they were stocking the strawberry cornetto type).  Now they ve all disappeared  and it s been this way for a couple of weeks.  I was wondering if you could tell me if this is a permanent thing  or if it s just temporary? They do stock the tubs of Swedish Glace dairy free ice cream  but it s a little disheartening to see freezers full of milk based ice cream  and only one choice for us vegans.  The store is in Princess Alice Drive  New Oscott / Sutton Coldfield.  Many thanks  Pete.;;;;;2016-09-11T14:10:10+0000;1473603010;2016-09-11 16:10:10;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The first time  the last space was taken by the car in front and there were no children  just overweight women and the second time I watched 3 separate cars park up with only adults in. At the same time that I watched these selfish individuals take child spaces  I watched 2 other families have to park in the section with the normal small spaces. If you are not going to fine these individuals for abusing the spaces  can you change the layout of your carpark? I need to use the wider spaces to open the car doors to get my children out of their car seats and I would be more than happy to park in the child spaces if they were at the back of your car park. I am more often than not parked at the back of your car park  in the hopes that other people will not park too close. I have also visited another store and found the child spaces were on the outskirts of the car park  this seems a much better lay out. To be honest though  yesterday s experience has put me off shopping at your stores. I m going to spend my money elsewhere in future  but I do hope you will improve your car park and make it more family friendly for other young families.;;;;;2016-09-11T11:41:16+0000;1473594076;2016-09-11 13:41:16;1;2;1;0;3;2;2;0;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

When/if/ you read your post you could help yourself find the answer (if possible) before consulting Customer Care staff and save time. If I wanted to ie know the opening times of a store in whatever area I need I would type this question and hopefully the answer will be revealed.

It s made my life a LOT easier this week I can tell you  and your delivery gentleman John  was an absolute pleasure to deal with!

After speaking with your tech support team it was organised that my sons hudl 2 would be sent back to them for repair after a software update left it unusable. This was a lovely gesture on your part as its out of warranty and you fixed it free of charge for which I am grateful and I thank you. But..... And here s the surprising but.... Though you have rectified the software problem and sent it back to us looking shiny and new it now doesn t charge  I mean at all!!! The charger gets plugged in (and we ve tried three chargers) and nothing happens. We discovered this last night when we tried to charge it for the first time since it came back to us last Tuesday (06/09/2016)!! I ve called and spoken to a nice man at your Tech helpline today only to be told that you won t fix it again  even though it s come back to us this way!! You ve said we MAY be eligible for a partial refund of the item at today s value (which lets be honest will be nothing as it was bought almost two years ago and you no longer sell the hudl 2). I just hoped you would take responsibility for this error and fix the problem you created so that my 5 year old can play with his tablet again. Surely this is a reasonable request?!?

Both of these instances were witnessed by one of your members of staff which my husband asked to help enforce this rule and was reluctant to do anything . This is what I would call bad customer service. Even if it is not his job to police the car park   surely if he is in a uniform representing your company we should get more than a few grumbles from him .   Angered from what I saw ( a mixture of people parking there without children and how this effects other mums ability to shop in your store . Without these spaces we cannot get children in and out of the car .. It s not possible ) as well as your staffs inability to do anything to help I shared this experience with a group called Babies Babies Babies and to my dismay the response I got sharing other similar stories in your carparks across the country came forward .   In fact some of these stories were worse with customers seeing your own staff park in these spaces without any children.   Tescos was dubbed the worst for instances with these spaces .   I am therefore writing because all these stories are ridiculous. Your rules aren t being reinforced and parents with young babies are paying the price.   I would like to know what you are going to be doing to fix this issue .   An idea I had was that if you parked in this space you would have to register your license plate with customer service so they could see you had a baby and actually needed the space .   I look forward to hearing from you soon .;;;;;2016-09-11T08:07:07+0000;1473581227;2016-09-11 10:07:07;0;6;0;0;6;5;3;2;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Just a feedback/fix request after a shop yesterday  here. :-)    I popped in to my local store yesterday evening to pick up a few things for the weekend and used Scan-As-You-Shop (SAYS) as per usual. Scanned the end of trip barcode on the checkout to have my shop loaded into the till  then went to payment and redeemed/inserted a bunch of close-to-expiry Clubcard vouchers I needed to use up or lose.  It was only then that I noticed the checkout I was using didn t have a [Cash] option on the payment screen  and it became apparent to me the checkout was operating in cashless mode. I paid the balance by card instead  but this was a minor inconvenience given that for once in my life I was in possession of just the right amount of change! :-D :-p    Could the SAYS till software please be revised to make supported and unavailable payment options visible and clear to the customer at a point *before* they scan the EoT barcode  please? With classic self-scan this is less of a problem as I can easily carry my goods over to another checkout if I see the one I m about to use displaying a [Start Cards Only] button  but as SAYS downloads the cart from the scanner to the till and then resets the scanner this is considerably more difficult to do on a SAYS checkout without requiring staff assistance.   I d suggest having an info-strip along the top of the screen (Like those displayed by credit card terminals) showing payment options accepted  with a visible cross over those which are temporarily unavailable. This is more likely to be noticed by customers whilst aiming their scanners at the EoT barcode on the top of the monitor. :-)    Many thanks for your consideration! 8-);;;;;2016-09-11T00:05:27+0000;1473552327;2016-09-11 02:05:27;0;8;0;0;8;8;4;4;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Me and my Partner have used the scan as you shop a few times now and each time we have to under go a random  security  check!  I understand that as a store you have a right to do this  but we have used it 7 times now and each time we have had these checks.  When I said something to a lady in store about this she said it was because we are only 20 and they do this to all young people. I don t feel this is acceptable from a company to discriminate against us because of our age!!  We also have under gone comments from other customers like  oh look the young ones are stealing again   oh they must have no shame sealing like that   I must stress that I suffer really bad from depression and anxiety and the scan as you shop was brilliant for me to help reduce my anxiety levels  how ever this is not the case.   I must also stress we have never used a Tesco since the incident with the lady confirming that Tesco discriminate against young people.  I also plan on never using a Tesco again and have moved to another super market.   Hope to hear from you soon.

Didn t want children to wait so said just two beans on toast instead. Told that was breakfast menu that ended at 12 (2 minutes ago when the breakfast was ordered) Very frustrated I asked for all the food to come at once when the children s meals were ready. Was told OK. Breakfast came out 15 minutes later  children s meals took another 15 minutes  Couldn t eat the breakfast in front of them  so had to let it go cold. Asked to see a manager and was told that no manager was in. I returned 4 days later and again no manager on site  I spoke to the store duty manager who took my details and said he would pass details on for a call back. (I watched him enter cafe and give info to counter staff) it s been another 4 days and I ve still herd nothing. Starting to think the extra in the store name means extra hassle.

She was wonderful  my 4 yr old son was having a meltdown moment...I think everyone could hear him. However  just wanted to say how amazing she was with both of us in the end. Just her kindness set me off crying...I had a sarcasstic remark from one customer  then there were a couple of supportive customers  which first started me of crying. I m sorry I don t know her name  because she should be awarded in her way for her compassion for her customers...even the manic  crazy  looking ones. I hope she can recognise this incident and know it s her I speak of. I was I  a rush for work and thing were not kept to my sons usual place...hence the meltdown but she was uderstanding  and I wish she gets some credit for this because she more than deserved it that day. P.S in love your free from section but can you please supply the gluten Breadsticks without milk/dairy (my son has many allergies) Much love to you all. Thanks for making my experience when shopping with a toddler in my own an easier one.  I have been given grieve from a certain super market about my child sitting in the trolley basket (I refuse to reutrn to this store after been attacked by an employer about it) which never seems to bother you.

I was in the Reading store on Napier Road this evening  just before 8pm. My boyfriend and I were walking down the entrance isle of the store when he decided it would be a good idea to  let the trolley do the work  (in his words). Being 6ft4   and almost 100kg  he soon realised this was not a smart idea when he found himself face down on the floor with the trolley flipped on its side skidding towards the wine and beer display. He told me after that he  couldn t control the trolley s acceleration  so had to let it go and accept his fate of falling flat in the middle of the store. We were approached by many of your helpful staff to ensure he was okay but as you can imagine I was I was crying and unable to talk from laughter as he embarrassingly apologised to those around us. After we had calmed ourselves we noticed there was a cctv camera which would have caught the whole thing....  it in anyway possible that we would be allowed access to these few humiliating moments??;;;;;2016-09-10T21:58:06+0000;1473544686;2016-09-10 23:58:06;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

We asked the fishmonger for some advice around which ones we can eat as we thought you couldn t eat the ones that didn t open. He assured us that (in not the best English)  its all ok  no problem.  Thank God we have subsequently Googled it to find out you have to firstly make sure they all close if open already and then discard any that don t open after the cooking process. The guy on the counter clearly had no idea what he was talking about and shouldn t have been on there (we also asked about portion sizes to be given no real answer.) Tesco - I feel let down on this occasion and there is clearly a training/staffing issue that needs to be addressed in this store. I would like to be given  a reason why I would return to your store when  had I followed the advice of your employee  I would have put my self and girlfriend at risk of food poisoning. I look forward to hearing back (the visit was at about 14.45);;;;;2016-09-10T20:13:23+0000;1473538403;2016-09-10 22:13:23;1;6;1;0;7;6;2;4;5;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

They say they venresearched nationwide  and the answer is to give us less choice . I say  if that s what you want then go to ALDI. That s their latest excuse for removing products then saying they ll reorder them  then changing their tune again. West Bromwich Extra- it s you I m annoyed with! Smaller Tescos stock more of what I want- eg Dudley and Princess Park. And you can spit managers on the shop floor there. WB ones have a cloak of invisibility or they have to be in meetings when you want to complain. To do this  join the queue which is for customer service  tobacco  lottery  stamps etc- so prepare to waste half an hour then be told the manager is in a meeting.

Firstly this isn t my problem and surely they can find alternate drivers to cover?

Reluctantly I chose the second option and I now have to go out of my way to collect it and use my own petrol to get there. The reason we get it delivered is so we don t have to take it up the stairs to our top floor flat so I ve now got to lug it all in my car and then all the way up the stairs into our flat.

I ve done my online shopping and weren t impressed with the delivery part. You have a new flexi system in which I don t like. I have to wait in longer for it unlike the hour before. But if I want to use the hour slot like I am use to its double the price. Friday slots are usually £4 plus and so I moved to Wednesday slots as they are £1. I have to wait in longer now to use the £1 slots which you advertised so well that you have slots for a £1 but they are either on the Wednesday or late evening. If I want my normal hour slot I have to pay double with I think isn t fair I spend over £100 and I don t have a good size car with a baby in tow to do it my self.

Dear Morrison s   After 6 1/2 years of loyal service my Tesco microwave went to electrical goods heaven. A short service was had followed by an emotional trip to the tip.   This morning I felt ready to embrace the relationship with a new microwave. I was in your Southend store shopping and spotted at the reasonable price of £40.   After purchasing said microwave I headed home to fill the void left by my Tesco one. After opening the box I was dismayed to find that the lead supplied did not reach to the plug socket. A mere 15cm stood between me and microwave heaven.   After nearly ripping out my entire kitchen and starting over   I came to the conclusion that an extension lead would suffice for now.   At last I have a working microwave but I am disappointed that Morrison s are cutting corners   or in this case cables to cut costs.

My 1 year old was in her stroller and 2 year old on her reins. Something must have caught my 2 year old eyes and within 10 minutes of being in the store her reins slipped out my hand and she ran.... My heart sank and within seconds she was out of my sight! I called out for her and there was no answer. Dashing around looking for her on my own wasn t working so I alerted a member of staff. All staff involved acted so fast and before I knew it there were so many staff looking for my daughter. What seemed like forever was probably about 5 minutes but they found her 😃 At this point I m in tears and still feel sick. But the staff were there for me and both my daughters. I would like to thank each and every one of you for ending a parents worst nightmare. A special mention has to go to a man named Paul who went the extra mile to help with my shopping at the checkout whilst giving the girls sweets and making them smile. He then carried my shopping to the car! Amazing customer service and being a dad to 4 himself he knew what I was going through.

I thought I had become well accustomed to some of your product peccadilloes and foibles (such as cream being foisted from its rightful place among the dairy and milk products)   but this morning my ghast was utterly and completely flabbered by an impromptu and increasingly frantic search for tinned tomatoes.  I must admit that this may be down to hubris on my part; there may have been a little self assured smugness as I entered the store  confidently telling myself that I had the matter well in hand - my quarry would be safely tucked alongside the baked beans and other tinned vegetables.  Imagine the Bean-esque dumbfounded expression that settled on my face when I arrived at that particular destination to find that no  there were no tinned tomatoes there!! Up and down the aisle I paced  at an increasingly slowed pace. It seemed obvious that I just couldn t see them. Alas  this was not the case. Remembering the cream stocking policy  I tried to apply the same warped logic.   THAT S IT!  I thought  they ve stocked them round by the pasta sauces! . I jubilantly strode into the next aisle only to be presented with a complete re-run of the previous scene in its entirety. I was now beginning to doubt my own mental competence as I looped the two aisles over and over  stooped to varying heights with each pass; this is surely the early onset of some kind of dementia I convinced myself.  Tomato blindness is obviously just the first in a devastating and degenerative array of symptoms that were now queuing up to beset me. Just to confirm this I had to prove that there were no tinned tomatoes present elsewhere in the store   after all   where else could they possibly be?  A few aisles across and my jaw dropped to the floor (or  for the sake of accuracy   just above the floor about level with the display of cooking salt in various packages).  I HAD FOUND THE TINNED TOMATOES!!  It turned out that  in their wisdom   Tesco have now stocked their tinned tomatoes   puree etc. in a new and convenient food category entitled  Tomatoes And Pulses . TOMATOES AND PULSES!!?  WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!? Why stop there?  Why not  Strawberries And Toilet Duck    Cabbages and Stationery  or even  Sausages And Birth Control ?

I have enclosed several pictures of a recent purchase I made from yourselves of a packet of replacement car bulbs. At first I though all was well  until I noticed the light did not last very long so I went to investigate the problem and to my dismay I have found the following problem. A broken light bulb that has melted to the side of the light connector resulting in the fact that I m not able to simply replace the bulb but indeed the whole light and connector. This is not a simple procedure. The main issue I have with this is that I have my MOT Tuesday 13th of September and due to the faulty light I know I will fail the mot test. I work 12 hour shifts and as such I cannot replace the faulty light before then as I am working between now and then. Further more for me to pass the car through the mot test I will have to pay a substantial amount more to replace the whole fitting as dealership costs are considerably more than a local garage would charge but I always have all of my car services and mot s carried out in my local Nissan dealership to guarantee genuine parts etc Thai couples with the fact that I m working so I don t have the time to get to a garage to replace the whole thing.  I sincerely hope that you can help me in this situation as I have bought a product from Tesco that subsequently will end up costing me quite a bit more in replacement fees!  Yours hopefully   Lee Phillips;;;;;2016-09-10T09:59:24+0000;1473501564;2016-09-10 11:59:24;0;6;0;0;6;6;3;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Have you tried putting £116 worth of shopping through a self service till? Yeah I think you can imagine what it was like  Fuming wasnt the word. So we managed to put the shopping through to then get my privilege card out for it to say staff discount not aloud...asked the same member of staff to please help his name was Ekram to try my card again and again which didn t change anything for him to then just shrug his shoulders at us and go help somebody else and ignore us so i said is there nothing you can do? Do I not get my discount then? for him to reply  Erm no sorry  and just walked away!! Absolutely disgusted with the whole experience and customer service I received and I work for One stop stores who are part of tesco so Iam even more annoyed as being a customer and  part of the tesco family I feel really let down as I would never have treated a customer like that at all especially if they spent nearly £120. He could see we was struggling and didn t seem bothered or interested and to not give me my discount which worked out at £11 which Iam entitled to just left me feeling stupid and embarrassed the way he handled it and to not shout a manager over or someone who could help....I will be contacting customer services tomorrow to make a complaint about this person to say he is representing tesco I would not want him working for me  no people skills at all and to dismiss us and help someone else in the middle of helping us and then come back to his post and just stand there and pretend we wasn t there was shocking. Anyway I expect a reply and some kind of apology and I will not be returning to that store again.;;;;;2016-09-09T22:42:12+0000;1473460932;2016-09-10 00:42:12;0;7;0;0;7;7;3;4;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I came to shop just before 5pm with my two children and was greeted by a lady doing an Oreo s promotion.  She told my children to buy some Oreo s and they would get a gift bag with new Oreo flavours to try.  We went and purchased some regular Oreo s and the kids were quite excited about it.  Now this is a little thing  but to my kids it meant the world.  So we went shopping for roughly ten minutes and came back to where the lady was only to find she had packed up and left!  Why on earth would she not have the common decency to tell us if she was about to finish or go on a break?  Why did she feel it was OK to let two children down over something so trivial?  I wouldn t be so offended and upset had she explained she was due to finish  but she didn t and as such I left with two upset and angry children.

I have tried many various brands and some are more expensive  more flavourful etc. than others. As I use it in my cooking  I don t need it to be fantastic  though I still appreciate an actual taste of honey! which leads me to my complaint.   I decided to try 2 different jars - your Everyday Value and  the next one up  that you sell  Tesco Clear Honey  Both state that they contain a blend of EU and non-EU honeys.   Without any actual evidence to back up my taste buds  I can t say with absolute certainty that the  Value  is more golden syrup than Honey  but they sure try to tell me this! It does not even smell of Honey. Your  Clear Honey  did have a smell of the actual product and some flavour  but not 100%  This issue has previously been highlighted by news programmes  aired on one of the main channels  so I know I m not out with the fairies. The conclusion was  after analysing several brands (not saying Tesco was one of them) that many many many of them claiming to be honey  were in fact blended  to varying degrees  with golden syrup or similar.   I notice that the jar does not say  Ingredients  - then Honey - it simply says Honey... So either this is Tesco covering themselves by  not listing any other  ingredients  or Tesco perhaps needs to quality control their imported honey or research the import sources more thoroughly. This is one product which (in my opinion) should not be sold as honey.  I would be very interested in finding out what the actual situation is and I would be happy to send you a sample of the contents of my jar  in for analysis if required  though I very much believe this to be unnecessary.   The £1 I spent on this  product   has not persuaded me to purchase it again.  Regards Maria Parrott;;;;;2016-09-09T20:01:48+0000;1473451308;2016-09-09 22:01:48;1;9;2;0;11;9;1;8;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;0

As well as to check my items that I walked in with. I have a very large Silver Cross vintage pram so I use the large shopping tray underneath for my shopping. Not only does she make a point of looking under my pram when i enter the store but also when I leave. She also makes a point of watches me on camera around the store as well which gives me the impression she victimising me. I am embarrassed for my self and my children who go to the local school as I have been stopped in front of my daughter s school teacher and her friends and other locals. Every time she makes a point of stopping me she does not apologise for doing it;  I just get a smug smile which is very offending after the embarrassment she puts me through. She has also told me not to use my shopping basket under my pram and if I walk into the store with shopping under it I have to show her before I get on with my shopping. i am totally shocked at the way I have been treated.

I had expected to have the 2 faulty cans replaced but all 8 was much more than I expected. Thank you so much for you kind and speedy service.

Nor have any Tesco employees in the smaller stores I have enquired in  (Billingshurst  broadwater  Tesco fuel stations etc)  I had come to Tesco to shop today because I could use my phone to pay and that s all I had on me!  The fact that this usually  staunchly loyal Tesco customer is annoyed yet again  probably means I ll go to the Billingshurst or Pulborough Sainsburys for a while and give my dusty nectar card a good outing!   This is in no way a reflection on Bbh Tesco as a store  I happen to know that manager Lee is incredibly good at what he does! It s always very clean and 98% of the time  I will get what I went in for.   I m disappointed that I was able to download the app and register my payment details  and my clubcard  get two emails gently reminding me to use the app and at no point did I get a warning that I could have to travel miles to use it!;;;;;2016-09-09T13:54:33+0000;1473429273;2016-09-09 15:54:33;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

If I don t get the reply soon  I will be forced to use other social media to try to fix the problem that my family and I are going threw. So  we bought Tesco car insurance  because  we trust your company and already are your regular customers. My husband is very sensitive driver and never had to make any claim. But recently somebody crushed into our car in residential area and run (no cctv cameras). We had to claim from our insurance to fix the damage. The way we have been treated is disgusting. We didn t even have right to get normal rental car. Instead  we got coutosy car that smells like cigarettes  dogs  cats and there are buggies wiped on the inside of the car. We made complaint and they did get it washed but not the way it should be. Only windows and vacuum cleaned. Buggies are still there as well as smell. There is also dog bites inside of the car and gears do not work properly. But we still cannot get normal courtesy car  because the person who damaged it run away. Why are we punished?! To make things harder  we have small child and I am in my last stage of pregnancy. Stressed 24/7 and scared to be driven to the hospital in it in case it dies on the road while I am in labour. I am scared to bring my newborn baby from hospital in case that she get some infection from the car because newborn babies immune system is not developed yet.  It makes me sick in my stomach the way your insurance is treating us. We feel anything but insured  covered and safe. Very bad customer service! Hope you fix that soon.

This time last year I was a brand new mum. I d had a pretty traumatic birth and had a particularly miserable baby girl  who cried a lot and I was very tired and stressed. In the 6 weeks following her birth I hadn t been out with her on my own  so when my husband went back to work I made the decision to venture inti town and go to Tesco to get some groceries. It was a hard journey for me  I was very anxious and tired and just when I was nearly done shopping my daughter started screaming in her pram. I was so hot and bothered and flustered and I very nearly just dropped my basket and left when an angel appeared and helped me. The assistant stopped what she was doing and commented on how lovely my daughter was  asked me if I had found anything I needed  and escorted me to the till where she rocked my baby in her pram while I paid for my shopping. She was completely amazing - if it wasn t for her my confidence would have been totally rocked and I don t know I would have had the guts to go out alone with my baby again if it hadn t been for her help. Anyway! I told everyone I know how kind this member is staff was but in my flustered moment I never caught her name. The other day while filling up in the petrol station I saw her!! I asked if she remembered me and she said yes  I told her my daughter is 1 now and I thanked her so much. To some it may seem like such a small thing she did for me but I was just so grateful it made such a huge difference to me. I told her I would give her some positive feedback so here it is: Jennie @ Stafford Tescos  you deserve some love for being so lovely  happy  helpful and caring. Thank you for helping out this mummy when she needed a kind word and some gentle support.  ❤️;;;;;2016-09-09T07:46:39+0000;1473407199;2016-09-09 09:46:39;5;3;5;1;9;3;1;2;3;0;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

I finished work at 1AM  and decided that I d like to go buy some pizza and garlic bread from Tesco to have as my dinner.     After driving from Central Milton Keynes to the Tesco in Kingston  I quickly made my selection and placed my items on the belt  only for the person on the till to ask the customers in front of me to close the gate behind them and informed me that it was self serve only.     Taken aback  I decided to leave my items there and select a different store whose dedication to customer relations is a lot stronger.

This evening at about 7pm I went to Tesco with my 3 month old baby. As I carried him across to the trolley area  a young man of about 18 working as a trolley collector saw me coming and immediately moved a twin baby trolley out of the way and took the single one out and brought it over to me and then held it steady while I strapped my baby in. I wish I d looked at his name badge such a thoughtful man really going the extra mile! He did this before I d even noticed that the twin one was in the way.

I m involved in a community event this Monday 12th September in Ilford  Essex. We are a group of volunteers organising a free meal and small gifts for families who are underprivileged in celebration of Eid. We are working on a referral only basis in conjuction with local women s refuges and food banks. We have been really lucky so far and have managed to source a hall and some local restaurants who are providing food free of charge. However we are struggling to get hold of other items such as disposable plates  cups and cutlery. We would also like to source some flowers for women who have fled domestic violence and small gifts for the children. We also need some drinks  serviettes  black bin bags and baby wipes. I ve contacted my local superstore in Goodmayes and they provided me with an email address to put my request in writing  but it s been 2 days now and I ve not had a reply. With the event only a few days away I m starting to panic a little as we still need so much. Is there anything you can do to help us please? I know that Tesco actively support community events and we would love to have you guys on board  we are excited by this event and any support or donations would be greatly appreciated. Please do get in contact with me at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your consideration of this request :);;;;;2016-09-08T16:19:36+0000;1473351576;2016-09-08 18:19:36;0;9;0;0;9;9;2;7;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

They were in stock so i scanned them both on the self scan handset  but the offer did not come up (they were on a separate shelf than where the others were with the BOGOF signage).  I then asked a colleague if they were on offer as well as the other sizes  and she said she would take them to see.  She scanned them through a till but the offer did not come up (she showed me the till receipt) so she informed me that they were not on offer  so i left without them.  I thought this was pretty rubbish (and was going to moan about that to you today TBH) but i have checked your .com store and they ARE listed as on offer?!? What is going on?? I m going to have to go back now to get them AGAIN and risk being told they are not on offer AGAIN (or they are now out of stock).  I m not a happy bunny :(;;;;;2016-09-08T10:35:11+0000;1473330911;2016-09-08 12:35:11;1;5;1;0;6;5;1;4;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

To the pharmacy assistant who glared at my three year old daughter who shouted when she dropped an item she was holding from the trolley  then told her she was noisy and she would have to learn to be quiet...words fail me. My daughter is loud as all toddlers can be but her manners far outweigh yours and I will not be using your pharamacy again. To the lovely lady in Customer Services who was compassionate when I explained the upset and was so wonderful with both myself and my daughter - thank you sincerely.   To Tesco management  your store is literally a stones throw from Aldi. I could save myself a few pounds by shopping there instead but have stayed as a loyal customer with you as I am truly appreciative of good customer service. I would be taking my custom elsewhere had it not been for the kindness shown by the lady (whose name I wish I had) on the Customer Support desk. In such a consumer competitive market  I would have expected better behaviour from your staff.;;;;;2016-09-08T10:25:10+0000;1473330310;2016-09-08 12:25:10;0;4;0;0;4;4;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

As they don t live nearby I asked at the till for a gift receipt and was told to go to customer services. You can imagine my surprise when  I asked this same question at customer services to be advised you don t issue gift receipts. When I explained that the items were a present I was told that I would still have the receipt so it wouldnt be a problem.  The issue is how many people send a gift to a friend 500 miles away with the receipt so they can see how much they have spent. I found that suggestion a little odd and was frankly suprised you don t offer gift receipts.  I promptly left without any of the shopping i went in for and will no longer shop in your stores for gifts for friends.;;;;;2016-09-07T22:08:38+0000;1473286118;2016-09-08 00:08:38;0;8;0;0;8;8;4;4;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I can t do anything?    What was she doing for the whole 2 minutes??..

I recommended your shop as it s cheap and especially good on back to school items. We got there and found exactly what she needed for an absolute bargain price which was great. I then thought I ll do a few bits of shopping for myself and thought to pick up a few bottles of cider for my dad as it was on offer and I had my ID with me and thought I d treat him! So we went to the check out  my sister used the self scan quickly for the shorter queue whilst I waited in line as I knew I would probably be Asked for ID. My sister waited on a bench for me to finish. So as the lady started putting my things through she then came to the beer and asked for ID (absolutely fine which I expected her too) so I got out my driving license for ID and asked for a bag and then to my absolute amazement  she rudely pointed to my sister and very nastily said to me  Has she got ID too  now i know shops have to be strict on ID which is absolutely fine but let s just remember It s ME at the check out  ME buying the items  ME paying for it and ME with the ID. No of course my 16 year old sister who ISNT buying the alcohol doesn t have ID why would she need it for buying back to school items????? The lady then refused to give me the alcohol. I m sorry but I didn t know the law was you have to be 18 along with everyone else with you!!!!!!! Say if my sister was 5 years old would you still ask the 5 year old for ID??? NO you wouldn t. Say if I was a young mom and she was my daughter would I not be able to shop for beer with her just cause she wouldn t have ID???? I m sorry but I am very disgusted after my trip and will not be returning again!!! At the end of the day I was buying the alcohol and I had the correct ID so why was i not allowed to have it????;;;;;2016-09-07T20:00:04+0000;1473278404;2016-09-07 22:00:04;11;37;12;2;51;36;9;27;36;0;11;0;0;0;0;1;0

Kudos on an awesome creation. I bought my daughter the new sheepskin type gilet in size 12-18 months and sadly a new start has left the tag on the pocket. The alarm didn t sound otherwise id of dealt with the issue there and then. I can t find the receipt   I never keep track of them. Can I still take it back to branch to have the tag removed or is that a tenner gone?;;;;;2016-09-07T18:46:30+0000;1473273990;2016-09-07 20:46:30;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Once again i must post how poor the fruit and veg quality are at out local branch. The dates for use are at best 3 days but last week we threw two oranges and grapes within 2 days. On average we throw various fruit and veg within 3 days as it just suddenly turns. What on earth is going on? Two years ago this was NOT an issue?  We find fruit and veg from waitrose lasts longer and is of better quality? Yes it costs more but lasts a dam sight longer!  Get your act together as im getting tired on raising this issue and like others i may start shopping elsewhere.;;;;;2016-09-07T18:09:11+0000;1473271751;2016-09-07 20:09:11;2;4;2;0;6;4;4;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Firstly  I bring my 5 year old up to the till to check a price of a toy to be told it s €5 because he had €10 I said he could get 2 only to go and pay to be told there €15 each. To say he was disappointed was an understatement. After finding him something else I went to pay for everything only to be overcharged. I pointed this out to the cashier who sends me over to customer service for a refund. I go over and it s closed and no one around. I ask some who says they will send someone over only to be left standing there. I am joined by two other people and we only get served when the women that joined me called a staff member she knew. I was waiting for 10 minutes. Once the refund is complete on my card  I m told I don t get a receipt but if I haven t received the refund in a couple of days to come back. I check my bank and they payment is there but no refund. Seriously is this the best you have offer your customers now.;;;;;2016-09-07T17:33:31+0000;1473269611;2016-09-07 19:33:31;0;2;1;0;3;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

Mostly I am happy with the quality and service  BUT there are somethings that could be better.  You have fishmonger counters where there should be TRAINED operatives.  Request a trout cleaned and scaled well you get one opened from the jaw to the tail  the gills are not removed  the guts are gone but the blood line is not removed from the backbone  and obviously someone has scraped a knife in a strip down the side of the fish leaving 99% of the scales still on the fish. This week I ordered Salmon Side  now whilst the fish had been filleted well and the pin bones removed  the skin was not touched leaving all the scales for me to remove.  I have in the past cleaned and filleted Salmon  the first thing that should be done is to remove the scales  it makes the removal of the skin easier!  It also means if the salmon is to be served with the skin then the diner does not have inedible skin.  I think it would be a good idea if the Fishmongers were to have at least 1 day at a local catering college where they could be introduced to the basics of cleaning scaling and filleting fish.;;;;;2016-09-07T15:44:11+0000;1473263051;2016-09-07 17:44:11;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

However not everyone goes back at the same time. For example  my 4 year old daughter is starting her first year of school this year. Her first full-time start date is the 19th September  with some other children opting into starting a little later. I decided I would buy her uniform much closer to her start date (because they grow so fast!). And after we had had her teacher visit her at home. I knew Tesco were selling some basic school clothes so I planned on heading there. Only just a week ago I saw the uniform all up on display  but today was a different story! I started to panic wondering where I would now get her uniform from. I don t drive and I am out of work so my options were limited. I frantically looked around for a member of staff and asked if by any chance you still had some of the stock outback. Luckily  a kind gentleman named Martin had over heard my conversation with another staff member and didn t hesitate to help me. He took me and my two children (I also have a 9 month old baby) outback and spent a good amount of his time making sure I had what I needed for my daughter to start school. He did a lot more than I would ever expect from a staff member and I wanted to make sure he was given some positive feedback for his efforts. I now have one happy 4 year old set and ready for her first day of school! Thank you #Martin from Whiteley Tescos. :) I also wanted to suggest to Tescos that maybe keeping some of the school stock out a little longer would be a consideration?;;;;;2016-09-07T12:44:07+0000;1473252247;2016-09-07 14:44:07;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Recently  On 2nd Sept   I bought RM129.98. And when the deliveryman sent goods to my house  there was a small portion  SAVE RM5 when you spend RM50 . attached below of the tax invoice.  Today  I spent another RM 153.30  i got the same amount of e-coupon RM 5.  Can you explain the statement  save rm5 when spend rm50 ? From my understanding  if i spend rm153.30  means i get rm5x3 .  I called Customer Service  she also was a bit  confused when giving explanation to me.  If customer only get RM5 coupon regardless the total of e-purchase..then you SHOULDNT write  Save rm5 when you spend rm50 ..  Just put  Save rm5 for spending rm50 and ABOVE  OR   With min e-purchase of RM 50 and above  you will save rm5   If I know it earlier  I will just split up my transaction from RM 153.30 to 3 transactions of each RM 50+.   Every customers are entitled for unlimited times of coupon RM5..right?  Bit dissapointed as tesco customer.  2nd inquiry : I never receive any email confirmation of my shopping list.  When you submit your items list   there is a message  an email confirmation will be sent to your email .  How is this happened?  Pls give me an explanation..Thank you;;;;;2016-09-07T06:15:03+0000;1473228903;2016-09-07 08:15:03;0;4;0;0;4;4;3;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Signed up for their payqwiq app.  First time I used it on self check out thought yes this is going to be so quick. Put all my stuff through scan my phone. What could be easier. Stays frozen on processing. I call the assistant over she messes with the till roll nothing. She calls the manager messes with the till roll nothing so she says I m sorry I ll have to print your receipt from the main computer.  10 mins later sheet of paper with my transaction on it.  Not such a quick system but I think ok first time these things happen.  Yesterday I return do exactly the same when I scan my phone it freezes on processing. Again various people come and mess with the till roll.  The managers says I ll print it from the main computer. Comes back 10 mins later says sorry I can t. I tell her I m not happy with out the receipt to tell me my transaction is complete.  My transaction could not be refunded because the till was still processing.  Eventually she said I ll get such a such he knows all about this system well along came such and such. Did exactly the same as everyone else with the same result. This was over an hour and I had to leave a very dissatisfied customer.  So later I ring customer services.  I tell my story the operator speaks to various people comes back and says were very sorry it happened.  That s really not enough there was no reassurance that this would be rectified.  I asked from the beginning for it to be raised as a complaint.  But no a sorry and what else do you want me to do madam is what I got. When I said I wanted my complaint raised and I wanted to know the out come he said sorry madame Tesco can not help you i will have to transfer you to the company that runs payqwiq and their very busy so you ll have to wait. I was less than happy at this point Tesco passing the but for a system that is operated in their store.  Tescos saying to a customer we can help you very poor show. Eventually  I m through to payqwiq the girl takes my name address email address I tell her my problem she says I m very sorry it s a new system when I say I d like to know the out come of my complaint she says Oh no we don t do that we don t contact people we just take the complaint.  What a disgrace Tesco you put in a new system you fail to train your staff on how to rectify problems with it. Your managers haven t a clue to the point they pass the but to an assistant and don t bother to come back and check the problem was resolved. Your customer service passes the butt and says it s not our problem. The company you use couldn t even reassure me it was a safe system to use and had the attitude of well listen to you complaint but we ll do nothing about it. Payqwiq nothing quick about it if I d of stood and payed with penny s it would have been quicker. As for your attitude to customer satisfaction what a disgrace. As for your whole payqwiq system my advice to everyone thinking of installing this app. STEER CLEAR GIVE IT A WIDE BERTH i would raise serious safety issues. I certainly would never use it again. But apart from that very disappointed in what was my main supermarket.;;;;;2016-09-06T05:57:38+0000;1473141458;2016-09-06 07:57:38;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have ordered and paid for a double bed frame to be delivered to my house. Received  a text message to say my bed was due for delivery today between 7am and 7pm.  It got to half past 1 this afternoon and I had heard nothing so I rang the number in the text message and spoke to a lady to ask if she could update me as to what time the frame was due to arrive. She then told me that the frame I had ordered had failed its quality control check and was not on its way to me and that in fact a replacement had been chosen for me and they were awaiting my approval. No one had bothered to contact me to tell me this and so it is not going to be Wednesday before my bed arrives! I asked the lady if she could tell me what time roughly it would arrive so I didn t have to waste another day waiting for the doorbell and she told me I would have to ring back after 4pm tomorrow to find out.   As a result of this poor service and sheer lack of communication I am not forced to sleep on my mattress on the floor because I am without a bed frame after selling my previous in time for the new one to arrive.   Will not bother buying anything else from Tesco direct and would like to know how you intend to resolve this complaint.;;;;;2016-09-05T17:59:14+0000;1473098354;2016-09-05 19:59:14;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Which I picked up for her so my basket was full & really heavy! & was stuggling to push the pram with the basket being so heavy!!! But still need to carry on shopping. So i headed to where the bread was when two of the works stopped me & asked if I was okay & would I like a trolly ( I said no thank you & I was okay & had the pram to push so couldn t have a trolly) the staff then said how much more you got to get ( I said only some bread I think) they then took my basket & said it will be sat waiting for you at a till for when you have finished getting all your shopping😊 i grabbed my bread & went to the till where my basket was they opened up the till & a member off staff put all my shopping on the conveyor belt for me.

Please address this personably and I would also like to know what your going to do about it. Do I bill you for the petrol used?

But they do not scan on hand scanner but still I have them in my grasp! Finish my shop  go to the till confirm I have an item that does not scan  man comes to help and tells me that he can not let me have these shoes because they have been removed from sales 😮😣😡😩 NOOOOO only these shoes were good enough for master and now we have to find more! He explained that the clothes department probably haven t been told they need to be removed from shelf and he can t possibly sell them to me despite my begging because it may be down to a safety issue. But on looking for another suitable pair we find more pairs of these forbidden shoes and I would like to think if an item is to be recalled then staff should be made aware of this straight away!?!?

My little boy has a cows milk protein allergy  so cannot have any dairy products  and he is also allergic to soya (which is common in CMPA due to the proteins being similar).  Most of the dairy free  yoghurts  you stock contain soya- including all of the tesco own brand ones.  In our local store there are only 2 suitable yoghurts  both made by Coyo (made with coconut milk) and plain or vanilla flavoured.  In the other supermarkets I have managed to get dairy free yoghurts made by  Koko   in the following 4 flavours: raspberry; strawberry; peach and passion fruit; and coconut and lemon. They are much more palatable. Is it likely that you will be getting a wider range of dairy free stock which doesn t also contain soya?

I bought Tesco roast in bag whole chicken  pork sage and onion stuffed for dinner today. In date until 8/9/2016. Got  roast potatoes  vegetables and gravy cooked  opened up the chicken bag after resting it  I was hit by the overwhelming smell of warm urine! This is the second time this has happened to me on a Sunday  the first was about 8 weeks ago. This not only means we had no roast chicken for today  it means I had to cook other chicken that was intended for later in the week and I do not have the left overs for tomorrow s lunches  I am not only out of pocket for today s meal (for family of 3) but for 2 other days as well...that is 9 meals in total. I am very unhappy. I think because we only have Waitrose   Lidl and Aldi nearby that Tesco think it doesn t matter if the quality isn t there as where else is the equal competitor?  I am seriously considering Waitrose as I will not be wasting money having to buy lots of extra food to replace bad produce the cost will be about the same.;;;;;2016-09-04T17:56:49+0000;1473011809;2016-09-04 19:56:49;1;5;3;1;9;5;5;0;3;0;1;0;0;0;0;2;0

So I will be shopping elsewhere.;;;;;2016-09-04T16:44:46+0000;1473007486;2016-09-04 18:44:46;2;6;2;0;8;6;3;3;3;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

He usually loves buying a nice big super saver bag of toilet rolls  and today he came home very pleased with himself after picking up a bargain of tescos luxury soft 24 pack for £8. Imagine his utter horror when he discovered the roll he proudly popped on the right hand side of our double toilet roll holder  only to find it had no perforations! On checking the other rolls he found they also had no perforations. What would you suggest we do? Take a pair of scissors into the bathroom? Leave an unsightly jagged edge hanging from our rather posh holder? Pls advise. Many thanks;;;;;2016-09-04T16:33:21+0000;1473006801;2016-09-04 18:33:21;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

A call to your Hudl team on Friday evening promised a call back yesterday (Sat 3 Sept) or Monday with an offer as I am not happy at having a third repair arranged when the previous repairs have left me with a device I cannot use and which I used my hard earned Clubcard vouchers to buy.  Remember  the Clubcard points were halved so I had to spend twice as much with you to earn them.  You also did away with the green Clubcard points.  The Hudl device is not being made any more so you can t replace it with a new one and this must be one of the reasons why you are not able to fix my Hudl  2 as you have no new parts to use.  I actually received a call this afternoon from you telling me to speak to Squaretrade (as I purchased an extended warranty with them).  This is despite the Hudl 2 being in warranty with you when it first went wrong.    I have tried to ring Square Trade but they are closed despite your member of staff and their website telling me they are open until 6pm today (Sunday 4th Sept).  I ve been a delivery saver customer since you introduced it and prior to that was a longstanding customer for many years shopping from home and also in your Tesco store in the citycentre and next to my old office.  I am really disappointed that you can t simply refund me my clubcard vouchers as I recently requested in my e-mail correspondence to you.

On 28/08/2016 I visited your store in Bradley Stoke to purchase a new top for an upcoming social event. Whilst trying this on in the fitting rooms my 8 year old son was sat just outside the door. I enlisted the help of 2 young members of staff for them to give me their opinion on which size looked better on me. Now I am not a small girl  I took a size 14 and 16 into the fitting room. The girls were friendly to my face and between us we decided the larger size fitted better.  Upon leaving the fitting room area with my son he became upset  started to cry  which is unusual for him. When I asked him what was wrong he told me that the girls on the fitting room were making fun of my size  gesturing to the fact that I am overweight and puffing out their cheeks etc whilst sniggering. As a mother I always try to instil in my son that although people come in different shapes and sizes  have different coloured skin and we don’t all look the same for him to be pleasant  nice and friendly to everyone. He couldn’t understand why these two adults could be so cruel. Upon paying for my new clothing the 2 girls had moved onto the till point. My 8 year old son then refused to come to the till with me and waited a little way back as he now viewed these people as “not nice” as they had made fun of his Mum and was a little bit scared of them. They spoke to me and said “oh  you decided to buy it then  it looked nice on you” it was at this point that I questioned them on their actions at the fitting room and told them that I was not happy that they had upset my son. Both understandably denied their actions  but I know that my son would not make this up and cry for no reason in the store. I am disgusted at their behaviour. Sometimes it can take a lot of courage for a larger person to go into a store and select new clothes  as a stockist of clothes up to a size 22 your staff should be more understanding of this. The psychological damage that can take place to a person after an experience like this could take years to recover from  or maybe it would deter people from shopping in store ever again. I am a reasonably strong person but still when I walked through the door at my home I burst into tears. These tears were not only for me but also for my little boy who should not be made to feel the way he was just by an innocent visit to one of your stores. I have the receipt for this purchase which I hope will provide the employee login for you to speak to the staff involved. I would ask that you advise them to be more courteous and understanding to ALL their customers regardless of their size. If by writing to you and you bringing the consequences of their actions to their attention it can save another person from suffering the humiliation that I was made to feel and to not have to explain to their children that some people in the world are not so understanding then this will be worth it.

Urgently needed medication for my daughter  unfortunately the store did not have the meds but he rang to find out where I could get them. As I am not from the area he gave me the post code for my sat nav and the meds were waiting when I arrived at the other pharmacy.

As usual no text or phone contact made. As usual I rang customer service to complain. The man I spoke to was defensive from the start  stating that unless the store lets them know they can t call customers. Maybe  but surely that is something to take up with the  store and not an excuse. The conversation continued in this fashion with him eventually asking me what I thought he should do. I suggested that Tesco investigate why the service from Gallions Reach is so poor and he said that there was nothing they could do if people don t want to turn up to work or do the job  short of rewinding 100 years and whipping people! ! I don t think this is an acceptable way to speak to a customer and would suggest that if your calls are recorded for training purposes  that you find this conversation and use it to show how not to deal with complaints! The home delivery service is failing at this particular store - Tesco need to sort it out quickly as I m sure I m not the only one considering a change of supermarket.;;;;;2016-09-04T06:33:24+0000;1472970804;2016-09-04 08:33:24;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We travelled to York to visit a different shop.   Much to our disappointment they were closed when we got there. So never mind  we said we would pop and get some milk and school uniform.  Wandering round the shop  my fiancé pushing the pram  me a trolley  as let s face it  milk and school uniform means we will take half the shop away with us!  Our son decides he is hungry  he s only young  and I ll be honest very spoilt as he s had a rough start to his little life at only 16 months old  5 anaphylactic reactions to date.  Anyway  can you imagine the stares from disapproving people as we are trying to keep him quiet  and him having none of it  shouting for food from the shelf. So we split up  this time me with trolley  so I could look disapprovingly at the fiancé pretending the little boy who is screaming isn t mine (come on if your a parent you have to admit you ve done this before).  Great a multipack of Pom Bears  I grab them  then find the fiancé (which wasn t difficult  I followed the noise!)   So I rip open the packet and give him some...... Silence  and the cute smiling baby was back.  We carried on round the store  staff were helpful  and polite  off we went to pay for our trolley full of shopping  luckily we did scan as you shop so checkout was painless  apart from of course the handing over the money part... That s never easy!  Then the serious part comes  our son  who if you remember has serious allergies  started with blotches appearing on his face  and within seconds his lips were bright red  and he started chocking. This is his anaphylactic symptoms  so we started working our first aid on him  oblivious to anyone or anything around us.  That was until a lady very loudly said   look what she s doing to that child  (he was chocking  so granted he was tilted upside down while I was smacking his back) until then she saw something come out of him onto the floor.... This is where I apologise  we didn t clean it nor inform anyone!   The lady then realised I wasn t beating our son for no reason  and offered help and support... Your staff were oblivious at the time! He then went floppy and unresponsive for only seconds but of course that feels like a lifetime!  My fiancé ran to the car to get his epi pens  my 9 year old daughter followed my instructions to get a bottle of water without paying for it (after a little panic about the security guard sending her to prison) and I gave inhalers and piriton!  After all this we really hadn t noticed anyone around us  and were just doing what we could for our son. We spoke to a member of staff explaining we would go and pay for the water once he was sorted  this member of staff was rude and ignored us  while looking directly at us  never mind... Another member of the team made up for his rudeness  telling us to get anything we needed for our son and nothing was too much trouble  after everything  and by now our son was running around  I went to pay for the water  we were offered a first aider  which we politely declined  obviously he s walking  drinking and eating so fine :)   So I d like to compliment the staff who were kind enough to support and help us  and the customer for stopping to check WE were okay (it shakes you up a little dealing with that)   But most of all I d like an answer to how I spent £54 and forgot the bloody milk???;;;;;2016-09-03T20:44:21+0000;1472935461;2016-09-03 22:44:21;10;6;12;2;20;6;4;2;2;0;10;0;2;0;0;0;0

I had a delivery booked between 7-8 which did not arrive. When I phoned to see what had happened they told me that the reason they had not contacted me to tell me my shopping would not be delivered was because they are not allowed to contact customers incase to worry them????? The whole point of home delivery is it fits around the customers life so now I am left with no shopping and hungry children. I was then told I could only have half my delivery charge refunded?????? Really???? You haven t delivered when required (Apparently the delivery driver was refusing to come up stairs when I have a lift??surely this is something the delivery coordinator should allow for) the customer service person also admitted that the delivery driver should not be working as he is not for to work yet he is out delivering???? So having had no delivery  no communication  having to ring around myself to find out where the shopping is and having to go out at 9pm to get my very hungry children dinner because I had no prior warning a customer services manager wants to offer me £9 goodwill gesture???? I ve had nothing but hassle this evening with it and on top of I ve had to drag the kids out at 9pm to get them dinner of which cost I was not expecting. For them to offer £9 is appalling and quite frankly no understanding of how much inconvenience they have cause tonight. Poor management of the delivery depot and poor customer service team which are clearly just trying to meet targets rather than offer customer service. Needless to say I have cancelled my monthly direct debit delivery that I pay as tescos have failed to make me see that they actually value their customers! I ve had to fork out over 20 pounds tonight which I was not expecting to do so and when living on a tight budget this is not on because tesco can t deliver or communicate but apparently they apologise??? Sometimes a sorry just isn t enough when so much disruption is caused to a family and unnecessary costs. I m now having to wait up till 10.30 for my shopping to be delivered...... unacceptable!!!!;;;;;2016-09-03T20:31:24+0000;1472934684;2016-09-03 22:31:24;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have shopped at Tesco for 25 years. I buy all of our groceries and use tesco fuel. I do as much Christmas shopping as possible at tesco and regularly buy clothes for the family. Every year we use our points to purchase merlin annual passes. Last year  I found that I had to upgrade these passes at a cost of £50 each to avoid restricted dates. In the past  we have used the vouchers for holidays  paying the TOTAL cost at Siblu and Haven with vouchers. I have just been through the clubcard website to see what I can spend some vouchers on before they expire. You can no longer pay for the total cost of a holiday with vouchers - it seems there are very little places you can pay the total cost with vouchers. Very disappointed Tesco. :(;;;;;2016-09-03T20:10:14+0000;1472933414;2016-09-03 22:10:14;1;11;1;0;12;1;1;0;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ve used Tesco delivery for years & always been a huge fan but the Erith depot are awful...& it seems to be getting worse. When it came out of Aylesford it was so much better.   Always numerous substitutions (some that are often ridiculous) & often late (although this late is a first!).   Had you not already taken payment from my card when you text me at 10am I would have cancelled it & gone & done it myself. At least then I may have been able to have lunch!  However  despite the delivery driver clearly not having a good day he still delivered it with a smile!

I ordered 2 Sistema Quad lunchboxes from you on Thursday to be delivered on Friday  1 blue and 1 purple. But with no indication of a substitution on the delivery note  2 blue lunchboxes were delivered. The delivery guy (can t remember his name) checked his system and could see that the purple one had been substituted so he apologised and I sent it back. Once he got back in the van he rang his team to try and get a new one sent out to me. They rang me to apologise again and say that they were out of stock of all but the blue and offered me a different substitute. As you will know if you have more than one child  all has to be fair and the same so I thanked the customer service lady and said no thank you. So I looked round various shops and eventually found a pink Sistema Quad lunchbox in another shop. Brought it home and showed my 2 children their new lunchbox. The 5 year old opened his blue one up and snap! It broke. So I phoned customer services. Close to nervous breakdown about the lunchbox saga and told Emma my tale of woe. After keeping me on hold for 2 minutes she said she would see what she could do and she would call me back. Sure enough  10 minutes later she called to say they were out of stock but were due a delivery tonight. Ordered me a blue lunchbox to be delivered tomorrow and sent me a £5 voucher as a goodwill gesture for all the time it had taken me. And that is how you do customer service Tesco. Well done!;;;;;2016-09-03T15:48:47+0000;1472917727;2016-09-03 17:48:47;2;4;2;0;6;4;1;3;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I shop at the Catterick garrison shop and have a blue badge  however I find it near to impossible to park in a blue badge bay as 90% of the time fit young soldiers park in these bays.  I have spoken to the soldiers and either get an embarrassed response  but they do not move or I receive abuse from them. I have contacted the store on numerous occasions.  They say they are unable to do anything about it  why?   If one tesco store can take action why can t the Catterick branch.

I have been a Tesco shopper since 1991 and I use to enjoy wandering round the Megastore in Bristol near my old house. Since 1999 I moved to Dorset  Dorchester to be precise. We have a very small store  which I had to campaign to get a 500 ream of paper on the shelves for me to buy; as it was an item the couldn t sell in Dorchester? I started taxing in 2001 to support my way through Bournemouth University. As a taxi driver I probably visit Gatwick about 10-15 times a month. In 2009 I discovered a mega store at Gatwick; I was absolutely delighted as it meant I could browse the Megastores again without having to go to far out of my way. I don t go to the store every time as I have a 3hr drive back to work. When I do go sometimes I get there early in the morning and I go and have breakfast then I phone my partner to make sure there hasn t been any urgent bookings; if there has I usually return back to Dorset  if there hasn t I normally spend an hour or two looking at the electronics department  stationary department  Xbox games. Recently in June after I got married we had some money to spend on gifts. I visited the Gatwick store; after I dropped off  to have a study of the smart TVs  as Curry has one on offer for £245. Two and a half to three weeks later I received a £70 parking fine in the post  reduced to £40 if I paid within 14 days.  My favourite megastore for the last seven years has suddenly got a rule that no taxis are allowed to park or wait in the car park! I tried ringing customer service  was told to go to the store in question  visited the Gatwick store  was told by the duty manager I had to go to the horizon parking company that fined me. After appealing with proof of receipts that I have been in the store  and asking why as a customer with no other vehicle to use other than a taxi  how was I supposed to visit the store? That Tesco or Horizon parking have not made provision to be able to apply for an exemptions certificate like I do with my local council to be able to use my local tip. Means I have lost the right to use this store due to horrible persons in the trade that use the store car park as a toilet  and use the parking bays as a waiting area waiting for jobs from their head office s. I think I might be shopping elsewhere from now on  I can t afford £40 every time I want to have a good look at all the products the do! I will especially start boycotting shops using these parking companies to fine third shoppers  2hrs is not enough time. Your the ones making your store like mini mall s! Stop trying to make us rush.";;;;;2016-09-03T15:18:54+0000;1472915934;2016-09-03 17:18:54;0;12;1;0;13;11;3;8;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

Whilst in the fresh produce section there were two members of staff clearly picking produce for online shoppers. One made a comment  well I haven t got to eat it so in it goes  as she tossed some fruit into a brown paper bag. The other member of staff complained that if customers only wanted green bananas they should get of their backsides and come to the shop themselves. Whilst I appreciate that we have bad days at work in a customer service role your team members should at the very least be professional especially when carrying out a service for paying customers on behalf of Tesco.

I then received a crappy automated email to say that my order could not be completed on the 03/09/16 and my money would be refunded (5 to 6 working days). No explanation given and very little in the way of an apology. I cannot begin to tell you how upsetting this is and it is a real display of the poor levels of customer service from Tesco. No only am I deeply disappointed that the sofa I wanted was not available (I spent a long time finding this product). If a product is not available you should not take the customer’s money in the 1st place  then to make them wait 6 days to get their money back is shocking. I am now left upset that my sofa is not available and unable to buy an alternative. This really puts me off shopping with Tesco and I am not sure I would even buy my groceries from you.;;;;;2016-09-03T08:03:50+0000;1472889830;2016-09-03 10:03:50;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My mum had to park away at the top end of the carpark. She has mobility problems and should not have had to park away at the backmof beyond to get to the store.   I asked customer service if there was anything that could be done and she told me  no its not a tesco carpark so we cant do anything  - but hold on a minute.... my dad parked in a parent child space not so long ago and his car registration plate was read over the tanoid to go to customer services. When he got there he was verbally forced to move his car to another space. So why wasnt the same done for my mums needs when she has mobility problems and needed a space close to the store instead of being like i said away at the back of beyond of the car park. Surely its not one rule for one and one rule for another Tesco.

Our visit today started as most normal visits do with our 7 year old going to look at the PS3 controllers all summer holidays he has been doing little jobs for money to buy himself a new one(he had to buy his own as he only wanted a new one because it looked cool!) and every time he makes sure you still have the £19 pdp afterglow wireless ones! Today he finally had £19 so looked at them and chose the one that glows blue(the choice was blue or red) we pay but are charged £20 he gets a little worried as he only has £19 but we tell him it s ok we will go to costumer services to get them to check the price the lady happily hose to check the item and the price comes back and says that the product didn t match the item barcode for the price but she offered to take us to the technology desk to see if they had any £19 ones left  hubby our son go with her whilst I go to see if paying the £1 extra might mean a better controller. I am looking at all the PS3 controllers and not one is priced at £20 as I m looking another member of staff asks if I m the one complaining that the controller is in the wrong place? I say not complaining just wanting to see the difference she then shows me an xbox360 controller I say we don t want an Xbox but a PS3 controller for her to say you picked £20 one not £19 customers are always moving things and blaming us I try to explain that I m not blaming anyone and I would like her to show me the £20 ones so I can compare them to the £19 ones as I m talking my husband the first customer services lady and another staff member join us the member of staff I m talking with and the new member of staff start complaining about customers moving things and then complaining they are being over charged again I ask to be shown the £20 ones again I was shown an Xbox controller first customer service lady says no where are these controllers(she has the one we had picked in her hand) for the other staff members to say they have no idea they must have been controllers that had been returned and have been put out with the £19 ones as they have no price tag for them only Xbox ones and we should have looked at the barcode numbers on item and the price ticket before we payed when I asked how I would know the price I got told you would know when you payed it s only a pound so what s the fuss? The only difference was the colour the controller glowed(red was £19 blue was £20) so I ask if we could be refunded for the blue and get the red(why pay just for a different colour?)First Lady say yes other ladies take the £20 ones and put them back with the £19 ones when I say don t you think you should move them or price them up properly they said no as they wouldn t have the price code anymore for just two items and if anyone complained they would just say customers have moved them!;;;;;2016-09-02T13:45:45+0000;1472823945;2016-09-02 15:45:45;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Every time the only parent and children parking spaces available are in front of Costa which is no problem. The problem is that every time there is only 1 trolley with the shelf for the infant car seat. And this trolley is filthy. The handle is covered in greyish black sticky stuff which is revolting  especially as you touch the trolley and then groceries or your baby.  I was just stop going to Tesco (at least until my daughter is old enough to sit in a normal trolley - I wouldn t put my daughter in the blue hard seats for babies as she is in a harness for hip problems). Then your employee Philip ( I think he is a  trolley manager ) approached me when I left the shop and offered to help me with putting my shopping in the boot  opening the doors so I could put the car seat in easier and return the trolley for me. I never experienced such helpful behaviour in a supermarket before. I just wish you would sort out the trolley situation.;;;;;2016-09-02T13:38:12+0000;1472823492;2016-09-02 15:38:12;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Iceberg lettuce  potatoes  cucumber amongst many other fruit and veg with a best before date of today (2nd September) no other choice of dates on the shelf and  when I asked  no other dates available. The person who I spoke to could not give me an explanation as to why  on a Friday  there was little fruit and veg which would have latest until the weekend!  I don t know  was all he could offer!!! Maybe as they are an isolated  small town store they think the customer won t/cannot go elsewhere.

It s a day and age where we never have to let people wonder what is happening or where we are. We have everything from good old phone calls to text  email  FaceTime  Skype  Facebook and Twitter.  Yet I am amazed that tesco seem to be unable to effectively use any of these forms of communication. I am wondering why I was sat up till midnight last night waiting for a food order that should have arrived between 10-11pm but never came. I waited till midnight on the chance that my driver was delayed and that he would be doing his best to get to me  that if my food was not coming someone would have had to good grace to have used one of these forms of communication to tell me.  Today I picked up the phone (that classic form of communication) to find out what happened. Apparently an accident MUCH earlier in the day had meant the driver didn t have time to complete his orders. Again this is where I am confused  an accident much earlier in the day meaning they had plenty of notice to grab one of those forms of communication and stop me sitting up till midnight waiting. But no call  no text  no email!  So disappointed in the awful customer service and I am amazed at the lack of consideration to your customers.;;;;;2016-09-02T09:36:29+0000;1472808989;2016-09-02 11:36:29;1;4;2;0;6;4;3;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;1;0

The staff deal with this and never have I seen anyone be thrown out for putting their items on a till. Today a lovely black gent and his lady were in your store. As the till wasn t free because someone was being served he put his items on the till next to it. No issue. Seen it many  many times. However your staff member seemed to take great offence to this and looked the chap up and down before raising his voice rudely telling him to  back off.  Trés professional. The customer simply said  please don t be rude to me. I ve done nothing wrong.  Security was called and the couple were asked to leave. Now  I d usually just assume that the staff member in question was just an idiot  but I ve seen the same guy deal with problem customers and druggies with more respect and courtesy. A few minutes before this another black chap was having an issue on self service and the way the same staff member spoke to him was simply disgusting. I go into this store on almost a daily basis and while I ve made many comments to my partner about this staff member being rude  this was way too far and I believe it was a personal issue the staff member has.

I purchased a tablet for my daughter in October last year . The tablet I purchased has now stopped charging. We have the receipt as proof of purchase and the receipt clearly states on the receipt that there is a guarantee for 1 year. We have been down to tesco to get this sorted to be told as after 30 days we have to go direct to asus. I was not happy about this as we go the tablet from you. If I d have bought it from anywhere else I would have taken it back to them why are you so different just because it s not one of your products? I have now wasted time and money ringing asus direct and my daughter is still without her tablet! We have been asked by asus for the serial number which we do not have( it s only on the box apparently which we kept for 3 months and then threw it) it s not on the receipt nor the tablet itself . They don t seem to believe us and so said they will send us an email so we can take a picture of our receipt and send it back before they will send out something in the post to get the tablet for a repair?! They also cannot speak English very well which is causing another issue ( don t mean to be rude but it s a fact) I have been waiting for this email to come and have had nothing so have just called them yet again to be told they don t send emails!!!!? The person we spoke to today tried fobbing us off yet again saying we need serial number we asked to speak to someone in authority and was told we have to email? ( they had just said don t do emails) all I want is for this to be resolved and for my daughter to have a working tablet especially as she s going back to school on Monday! I am very annoyed at tesco lack of customer service here as we purchased it from you and I feel you should be dealing with this regardless of who the tablet was made by! We have a useless product and are still no where near resolving this nearly 2 weeks on!;;;;;2016-09-02T08:26:49+0000;1472804809;2016-09-02 10:26:49;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I parked not close to the store but not miles away with nothing either side of me when I parked up. This is because I m 8 months pregnant and the size of a small whale and my mother who was with me has just four weeks ago had a full knee replacement and is on crutches and struggles getting in and out of the car   my problem is that I m not a mother and baby yet and she s not classed as disabled so we can t park in spaces that are wider.   When I got back to my car someone had parked next to me  which of course they are entitled to do but hadn t left much room at my side to get in the car. We actually saw him park and get out of his car as we walking up to my car and I complained that we had done so well not to have anyone park near us till just then.  Anyway unpacked the trolley and put them away while mum was getting in. In that short time the man had come back to his car and was sat inside. I went to squeeze in with my ginormous belly and my car door just touched his wing mirror  there was no mark at all on his car I literally just touched it and grabbed the door and pulled it to me. I then waved and said sorry through his window to which he got out of his car and came round to check his wing mirror and my car. Proceeded to shout through my car window  which won t actually go down as its broken. And tell me that it s a good job I ve only damaged my own car. I no my cars scratched and bang from myself banging it on my house wall in the wind! So I opened my door and said to him well that s alright then! And he shouted about it would have cost me money and I should be more careful.   And very aggressively got back in his car slammed the door and drove off.  Now him I just find rude and arrogant. I didn t mean to touch his car  he hadn t left space and I did apologise I really didn t even make any sort of mark at all on mine or his car. But in the future what am I supposed to do ? Park a million miles away with my waddle and mum on crutches? Park in a space not designated to us at risk of been penalised for that or have arguments in car parks sighs very rude men?;;;;;2016-09-01T17:07:57+0000;1472749677;2016-09-01 19:07:57;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Unfortunately tesco s at the time of the purchase you had the policy in place that I could take it into any store and so therfore you should adhere to that policy that you had in force when I purchased the product.  Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015  goods should be of a satisfactory quality  fit for purpose and as described. My rights have been breached because the item you sold me is faulty.  Phoned customer service up and they have advised that I must go to a bigger store. I have asked them if they will refund the cost of getting a taxi there and back. They are unable to advise me if they can or not. They have advised that I post the product back to head office again unable to advise if they will be able to cover expenses for this.  Manager would not speak to me  he is too busy apparently   Through no fault of my own I have been sold a faulty electrical product and tesco is making it very difficult for me to come to any resolution. I am seeking currently seeking legal advice.;;;;;2016-09-01T16:41:44+0000;1472748104;2016-09-01 18:41:44;1;7;1;0;8;6;2;4;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

My daughter is breastfeeding her 4 week old baby. And up til today has been using boots own breast pads with no issues.  However we picked up some of your own brand breast pads yesterday while in your cleethorpes store. She began using them today. Not only does she need to change them pretty much hourly as they are so rubbish. But after rushing to feed her baby  baby started choking. We very quickly held her up and she was sick. Then realised that all around babies mouth and my daughters breast was the inside contents of the breast pad.  As already stated. The breast pads are changed almost hourly due to their poor absorbance. So for them to split and become so hazardous so soon is shocking.;;;;;2016-09-01T15:59:30+0000;1472745570;2016-09-01 17:59:30;0;7;0;0;7;7;1;6;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

An hour into my journey I began to tire and pulled over to change my contact lenses for spectacles. Digging into my wash bag for the lens case I managed to slice my thumb on the three bladed razor that I d obviously forgotten to cap safely - blood began pouring everywhere and of course the first aid kit had gone to scout camp with my son and not yet been returned. I saw a Tesco up ahead and even though it was almost 4pm (closing time) I asked if I might be allowed to purchase a box of plasters.   I was taken into the store to the customer service desk  handed a tissue  asked how the injury occurred  received treatment with an alcohol sterilising wipe followed by a plaster and shown to the toilets so I could clean up my arm and change my contacts. I was then offered help in cleaning the blood from the car interior.   This was after closing time on a bank holiday shift; they could ve denied me entry to the store or made me buy plasters for myself  but instead they took me in and tended gently to my wound without a second thought. At no time was I made to feel a nuisance or rushed. I even said you don t have to do all this - to which they replied that they knew they didn t have to  but they wanted to.   This happened at Tesco in Farringdon on Monday 30th Aug 2016 and the man on the door was called Gary  the man at customer services was called Trevor and there was another young man at customer services whose name I didn t get.   Please arrange for these three exceptional members of staff to be rewarded for their wonderful customer service.";;;;;2016-09-01T15:42:23+0000;1472744543;2016-09-01 17:42:23;4;3;4;0;7;3;2;1;2;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0
