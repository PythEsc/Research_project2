I was browsing the paper  just to check all the supplements are there.  Secuirty guard approached me and become very abusive!  I was shocked at the way I as spoken too and the way I was treated.  I have shopped at this store of years  all the staff are friendly and nice.  I asked to speak to the Manager and asked his name.  The security guard became very aggressive and refused to disclose either.  My 15 year old nephew was with me as well and had to watch this and also the security guard said that  I stinked  as well in th whole store which was deeply embarrasing and humilating.   I am a Tesco Shareholder and also worked with Tesco directors in a professional capacity.   If this is the way Tesco treats its customers then I am taking my custom elsewhere and I a complaint email is on its way to Dave Lewis!;;;;;2016-04-30T22:34:05+0000;1462055645;2016-05-01 00:34:05;1;9;1;0;10;9;4;5;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Today I had to call in a plumber as there has been a smell of sewage in my house for a couple of weeks. They took up the floor at the back of my house and found such a bad blockage that there was sewerage leaking out of the cavities in my walls and about a foot of stagnant water under my floorboards. When they pulled up the manhole cover it was absolutely stuffed with biodegradable wipes.  They told me that the flushable wipes we have been using should never be flushed down the toilet as they do not break down as advertised.   It has been a very expensive and stressful day  and apparently this is a very common problem that they see all the time.

I then arranged for a day s holiday from work and asked a TV engineer to come today to set up my Sky on the TV.  When completing my purchase  I forgot to add the £20 discount  so I then ordered a second TV and . I then telephoned your support centre to cancel my first order and was told by your operative  she would cancel the second order and refund me the £20. I asked her to ensure my delivery date was still today  she assured me it would be.  I called your support service this morning  to gain an update as to what time my delivery would arrive. I was told by a man  my delivery was delayed  he said it would not arrive until Monday. He said he could cancel my order and re-order to allow me to collect it from my local store. He said he would do this and call me once completed. After one hour and he had not called  I called your support centre again. (Meanwhile; I had raised a complaint online.) I was told by the second man  my TV would not arrive until Tuesday  due to the bank holiday. I asked why the first man had not called me and was told that due to my online complaint  he had been told not to arrange delivery to my local store. I then asked to speak with a manager as I could not believe  the way I  as a customer  was being treated.  A duty manager came on the line and told me  she would arrange delivery for tomorrow  30th April. I asked  who was going to pay the cancellation fee for the TV engineer and I was told that Tesco would not be responsible for this as it was not a legal matter.  I am now awaiting a call from the duty manager  to confirm my delivery tomorrow.  I am sending you this correspondence  as I feel you should be made aware of the way your committed customers are being treated and I would welcome your response.  During 2014  I had a similar online experience with your company and I swore then  I would never order from your site again. This is my first time  trying again and will absolutely  be my last.  Many thanks for taking the time to read my complaint.  Best   Catherine Murphy FCIPD";;;;;2016-04-30T09:22:35+0000;1462008155;2016-04-30 11:22:35;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Carol  the staff member serving him  explained to him clearly what had happened and swiftly offered to personally pay for his shopping so he didn t have to worry about it.

Whilst I don t normally buy pre prepared food as I was going on holiday I thought an instant meal would be good.  I purchased some bourbon glazed ribs and some tesco coleslaw and potato salad. Even though I followed the instructions to the letter the meat was mainly fat and gristle. The bourbon sauce was chemical tasting and synthetic. The potatoes in the salad were undercooked and inedible and the coleslaw was tasteless.  Yet again Tesco hit the gutter with their food and every time I give them another chance their mediocrity stoops to an all time low. Before you ask I haven t kept the packaging as it s now in my bin underneath the foul food I foolishly spent my money on. When is tesco going to actually put some muscle behind the customer journey and stop expecting their customers to follow them like sheep. Is this why aldi and lidl are beating you? I am old enough to remember when the Tesco promise was  pile it high sell it cheap   nothing has changed.  You clearly employ the unemployable and provide little training and most of your employees see it as a job and not a vocation or a career. Hang your head in shame Tesco;;;;;2016-04-29T19:14:25+0000;1461957265;2016-04-29 21:14:25;0;5;0;0;5;5;2;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

They used to be perfect  perfect fit  no leaks etc. I have used them since my little one was born and had no problems  now they leak after not being that wet and leave the crystal gel bits on her skin. They are also a poorer fit. Scrolling through I see many parents have the same issue!! Surely you should be listening to the parents who were loyal to these nappies and change them back  why fix something which wasn t broken?!

In her possession she had with her a bottle of Prosecco purchased from Sainsbury. She went to the sandwich display and selected a sandwich before going to the self service checkout. She did not go near the alcohol in your store instead paying for her sandwich before leaving with her purchase. She was then followed out of the store by a member of staff and escorted back in. She in full view of the public was called a thief and accused of stealing the wine. When her receipt was produced she was released.

Why did I bother?!  I placed an order last Tuesday morning (19th April) to be collected between 4pm-6pm. I went though the payment process and all went through fine. Got to the store at 4pm to pick up my shopping to be told my payment didn t go through because the card on my Tesco account was one I no longer used and hadn t realised as it all went through ok. I didn t have my bag with me as just rushed out thinking I was picking up shopping then rushing back to work. So had no means to pay. So I had to unload all the shopping I d just loaded out of my boot and was told I d be called later on. Which I wasn t. So I called customer service myself and spent time changing my address and going through the day s events and was offered £5 voucher which I didn t think was helpful as I needed my shopping not £5. I was then asked  what would you like me to do?  I wanted to make payment over the phone but was told that was possible so the gentlemen I spoke with tried to put me through to the bedford 1 store and no answer so again was told I d be called back but I m still waiting now over a week later!!   It s supposed to make your life easier and quicker but this wasn t the case with me. I completely understand that sometimes things don t go as smoothly as usual which is fine. However I do believe it s how a problem is dealt with. And this problem was not dealt with in any kind of manner I would expect so I will more than likely never use click and collect again for the pure headache it caused me.  I d like to know what would be the appropriate way to deal with this?;;;;;2016-04-28T14:54:38+0000;1461855278;2016-04-28 16:54:38;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

It doesn t take rocket science to realise you are fading out  value  foods & are replacing with new brands.. Labelled different as farm grading names. I went into my very regular tescos Amersham & had this confirmed by the lovely Di on customer services. Why do people feel the need to moan? I just don t get. Value.. Bottom shelf.. Standard.. Middle shelf.. Organic top shelf.. It s that simple. I shop accordingly..  But I must confess the  farm  names lead you to believe that things are  a little  healthier/better  than they really are.

Please do something about it.;;;;;2016-04-27T18:02:11+0000;1461780131;2016-04-27 20:02:11;1;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

On visiting your store today I purchased a months worth of shopping  plus clothes etc extra. On going to the till  I was having to carry my 4 month old as he had fell asleep in my arms. I went to a checkout which was empty and started to load up the shopping on to the belt. The cashier decided not to give me time to empty my trolley but to start scanning it through piling it up at the end of the till. She never asked if i once wanted help with my packing. She just kept stacking it up. Once I had finally got my shopping on to the belt I proceeded to the end and she asked me if I would like any bags. I did and purchased some. Still  no ask of help with packing. I then proceeded to pack. One handed may I add and try and get it all in to my trolley. Still holding my 4 month old. She didn t stop to even let me catch up. She just kept piling it up. What more... She got up off her chair to bring items scanned to the gap at the bottom of the till. Sat back down and kept scanning. I finally got all my shopping packed  my total was over £150! So I have just spent £150 plus in your store and your cashier couldn t even be bothered to help me pack? Seeing I was struggling. I am not happy and I would like a response. Thank you.   Faye Lippitt;;;;;2016-04-27T16:51:22+0000;1461775882;2016-04-27 18:51:22;0;12;0;0;12;11;11;0;7;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

You have recently changed the recipe and the bread itself!! £1.80 a loaf is a staggering amount for a load that is only 380g but unfortunately my other half is polish and can not stand English bread !!! Before the recipe change it was delicious and real sourdough now it s horrid!! The otter skin is different and the cut in the top is awful!! Before it has 3 small cuts now it has a huge cut down the middle which often cuts the roof of your mouth and makes it impossible to cut ! For the past 3 days I haven t been able to buy it due to the St Andreas fault line running dow the middle!!! I was originally told via your customer service that they would check in store re baking to make sure all was being cooked correctly as its a express store i know the staff and we have had many a conversation regarding the cooking process  I have even purchased frozen and cooked myself to check it and it s the bread not the store!  Can I also add the staff at the express have been fantastic and very helpful but I am now having to complain again !!! For the fact that the store offer nothing else as a alternative and £1.80 a loaf is crazy I can easily do £10 a week just on bread!! I was told yesterday that the supplier was meant to be writing to me but I have heard nothing and I am getting fed up I feel I am being brushed off!!!;;;;;2016-04-27T16:48:44+0000;1461775724;2016-04-27 18:48:44;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I asked my father to purchase some cookies from there on Monday as a super scrumptious treat for not feeling very well.  He got me the double chocolate and white chocolate bags of cookies.   I m very sad to say that these cookies did not live up to the usual high quality I have received from a Tesco cookie in frequent previous encounters.   They were dry and hard and I genuinely thought I was going to crack a tooth biting in to one of the White chocolate cookies at one point.   This is not what I expect from a Tesco cookie  or from any cookie for that matter that have been freshly baked. They should be soft and gooey.   To say I am bitterly disappointed is an understatement. As part of a family that has shopped at Tesco for as long as I can remember   I highly doubt I will be consuming your cookies or any other bakery good if this is what your stores deem as acceptable quality.   I do hope you take these points on board to avoid further customers being as deeply disappointed as I was with the bakery products.  Kind regards  Natasha;;;;;2016-04-27T14:43:40+0000;1461768220;2016-04-27 16:43:40;1;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I visit this store every single morning. This morning I was buying a little extra due to a staff party at work. This means it took a little longer for me to scan and bag my items. This is the bit that really got me..  While scanning my items there was another customer standing a bit too close for comfort (I presumed she was in a hurry so I tried to be a little quicker). She then said  Hurry up its waiting for 10p  when I was actually waiting for change to that amount. THEN she shoves in to me and tells me to move my bag  before I m even finished shopping!  Maybe the staff who were standing around open mouthed could have served her instead of making me feel rushed and embarrassed!;;;;;2016-04-27T09:38:07+0000;1461749887;2016-04-27 11:38:07;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

This was a great way of saving money which has now been taken away.  On top of this  the Clubcard points collected by using my Tesco credit card have already been decreased  so not only can I no longer boost up  but I have less points in the first place.  Double whammy! I m seriously considering changing credit cards - realistically what do I now  gain  by using my Tesco one? Seems like you lured us in with extra Clubcard points  and boosts to make it even better   then took both away - presumably hoping we wouldn t notice as it was done at separate times.   On a separate note  I was at a friends house last night  who was expecting her delivery order. It was late again (2nd time in 2 weeks!) - and when it arrived  the receipt which the driver left behind wasn t even hers. So we could tell you exactly what another customer had ordered. Admittedly  once she had phoned to complain the driver did return with the correct paperwork  however surely this is a breach of confidentiality. The name and address of a customer being handed to another? She then discovered that the biscuits she ordered had been unavailable  but no replacement sent. Surely it can t be that hard to find an alternative to hob nobs! Given that my friend uses the delivery saver  I would suggest that maybe  again  people have been lured in to paying for this  but don t seem to be getting the service they are entitled to.  Seems like things are starting to unravel for Tesco at the moment. You need to get things sorted before you loose all your frequent customers.;;;;;2016-04-27T06:25:13+0000;1461738313;2016-04-27 08:25:13;3;8;3;0;11;7;5;2;2;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

Delivery saver perks have been messed with  too...we have to order a minimum of  £20 now for f*$king click & collect? ??!!!! Also it has NOT gone Un - noticed that  you always put your prices up a couple  of  days before  every  boost  event!  You gave an amazing  petrol deal for almost 18 months & altho it will be missed  it WAS only a temporary  promotion so I feel that s fair play.But now??? You tell your customers they have 2 months to use all their boost vouchers??!! You KNEW people were putting their own extra money into the christmas savers club yet you still allowed these people to put THEIR money into YOUR company  (nice little amount of interest I bet that s earned you on your company  accounts! ). You are a TINY step away from actually  breaking money - laundering laws! I ve seen your  what s in & what s not  info regarding  this - the LAST boost chance  for customers! ! & I am  fuming  about the f&f clothing  being an in store only way to double up 😠 !

This was in your Chichester store about 6:30pm and the staff member that got rudely spoke to was called Harry.   I was embarrassed for him at how degrading a fellow colleague was towards him... It was to the extent that a fellow shopper actually mentioned something to Harry about how unacceptable it was. It took place on the self service checkout after a Harry helped a customer out...admittedly Harry himself may have been slightly in the wrong as he was on shift whilst purchasing a bottle of water...but that in no way should sanction the way his colleague spoke to him!  He was also only trying to help a customer who had been waiting for this other staff member to respond!;;;;;2016-04-26T17:38:45+0000;1461692325;2016-04-26 19:38:45;0;4;0;0;4;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

It s  lovely to see points earned  going even further for day trips and entries into national amusements & restaurants etc. Sadly I live in Cornwall  and many of us use our points in store as we  have found local places to use our vouchers quite limited ( even down to the lack of selected cinema s to use a double up voucher!) There are obviously a few restaurants but maybe only 2 or 3 on the list meaning variety is poor  but the theme parks etc would require such an amount of money to be spent on travel and accommodation they make the scheme not feasible for many. My question I suppose is  is there still going to be a way to get the most out of your points in store and if not how will they be tailored to suit the areas of the country when the  big branded Tesco Clubcard partners  aren t readily avaliable so we too can still benefit from the amazing deals shopping with Tesco has to offer?

Like many here  I use the double up on Christmas presents  and mine will not be writing Father Christmas letters in May  and the must have toys wont have been announced/released. I don t find the other offers good value as there are usually voucher codes for free for days out/restaurants that are close to the saving anyway. We have other financial products with Tesco that gave us extra points along with buying petrol from the petrol stations  this no longer competitive without the double up. We will unfortunately be switching to providers offering better value.

A lot of families struggle to get by just buying their food shopping so the fact that they come to you knowing at the end of the year they will get a little something as a reward is a real help. Now you re trying to make things fair for everyone by taking away the small things that really made a difference to people s attitudes on where they shop and also how different their christmas can be. You re no better than politicians give to the rich and take from the Poor. We save our points every year to be able to provide a great christmas  and this year we have a newborn baby that we were hoping to use our points doubled up to take financial pressure of us. Seems you ve just added a lot more and provided us the difficulty of even a basic christmas.  Thank you Tesco.

Of course it is. Silly me thinking you were only interested in your profits. We re a growing family of 5. Last year we spent around  £8000 in Tesco on fuel and food  and the club card boost at Christmas helped us to get our kids a few extra bits they wanted. Now  you ve stopped the fuel scheme   and the club card boost  so we feel we have no reason to shop with you. There is zero incentive to stay with Tesco above the cheaper supermarkets.

In the last 2yrs they have gradually dwindled.  No longer giving customers money off big shops. No fuel incentives. I ve not had any coupons for several months ( which is not a post issue as they would normally be available online also). Increased delivery costs and minimum spend.  Now you re informing us that you re getting rid of clubcard boost.  So now you re not giving customers ANY incentives for shopping with you then I may as well spend my thousands elsewhere. My hubby was making sure he filled up his work vehicle to save up the points. He drives a good thousand miles a week!

She s just 37 and is a wonderful mother & friend to all that know her. Unfortunately Annette was diagnosed with Cancer in 2014 & has been out of work battling this terrible disease with the hope of returning to work when she was well enough to do so.This was a real possibility for her until she recently received the devastating blow that her cancer is now secondary and is now battling again to try and beat this. The offer of redundancy has come up and Annette decided to take it only to be told the other day that she is not entitled to it as she is out sick.

Let me set the scene-  there was a child of no older than 10 who had been sent into store with a rather large shopping list  he d collected the items and was at the self checkout. He paid for his items and began to bag them. The women behind the desk who I failed to collect the name of kept giving him really stern looks. She then confronted him and said you haven t paid for those bags in a harsh manner. The CHILD started to panic and claimed he had to which her response was  well it s not on your receipt  so you haven t . So the child simple says  I thought I did but I ll pay again . By this point he has got himself into a bit of a flap and I can only imagine is panicking and starting to feel embarrassed as the queue is starting to grow. To which at this point the lady behind me said  is this really necessary ... And to be honest she had a point. Could the women not have just let it go for once. The lady kept on at him whilst he tried to rectify the mistake so I stepped in and said  don t worry poppet I ll pay for your bags with my shopping  you go . To which he very politely looked at me in shock and said  thank you very much .  Your employee then commented that  you shouldn t be doing that  you have no idea how many people don t pay for bags  I m only doing my job . This was said in quite an agressive/defensive tone. I appreciate she was only doing her job but as I pointed out  he was an innocent child . I did not like how she told me what I shouldn t be doing  at the end of the day it s my money and my right to spend it as I will and as a decent citizen I am aware of the choice I made in that moment. I believe this women should have taken the time to go over to him  look at the receipt with him and discuss it. He in no way showed aggression or was rude so he attitude was unnecessary  and quite frankly I d be proud to be the parent of such a well mannered child who is willing to correct his innocent mistake. I know you have to charge for bags but honestly he was a CHILD - what has this world come to for people to get aggressive over a carrier bag? It was only 10p - is your company not making profit targets that she had to be so pedantic over such a little amount. I believe and so did the women behind me that this was a genuine mistake on the child s behalf and did not need to be dealt with the way it had.  I trust you will take steps to talk to the store about this employee and look forward to your reply.  Regards Deanne Bates;;;;;2016-04-25T07:40:37+0000;1461570037;2016-04-25 09:40:37;3;9;7;0;16;9;6;3;11;0;3;0;0;0;2;2;0

As I was queueing at the self service checkouts I heard a woman in front of me in the queue saying that the staff member on duty at the self service check out had been shouting at an elderly man. I was thinking perhaps she misheard but then I witnessed the staff member shouting at this man simply because he was unable to work the machine. She kept shouting at him saying  I just told you how to do it and you did not listen  and  you ve paid for that twice now for god sake   Now I myself work in a retail environment and I would like to think tesco do not condone this behaviour amongst their staff. When I had finished paying for my shopping  the man had finished also and was talking to another woman who was as shocked as I was by the staff members behaviour. The man was shaking and when I asked him if he was ok he looked at me with tears in his eyes.  This is totally unacceptable. This woman needs taken in hand  she spoke to a harmless old man with such disrespect.  Others heard her and I hope they also contact you about this matter. I hope this will be looked into  Thank you;;;;;2016-04-24T22:07:34+0000;1461535654;2016-04-25 00:07:34;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

This new style of packaging where you are now labeling foreign produce as  Redmere farms  or others is misleading and completely unnecessary and slightly abhorrent  When i shop online i am finding a lot of the items i want to buy are out of stock or unavailable. Meaning if i need the item in my delivery i have to get a more expensive item  pack sizes seem to get ever smaller on offer products as well  A major problem i recently had in your Cowley superstore was that i wanted some cooked chicken that was not reformed and was British for a reasonable price (lets say £3 for 200g)  could not find this at all  went down the road to Lidl however and they had 200g of British non reformed chicken for £1.99 and it tasted great  The quality of the cooked chicken i have had from Tesco recently has not been good at all  To me i look at the recent Financial constraints Tesco has been under and i wonder if the boardroom solution they have come up with to it is to try and sell substandard and poor quality goods at premium rates and therefore increase the profit margins for Tesco  I personally am not sure consumers will be fooled   Your disappointed consumer   OHJ;;;;;2016-04-24T17:55:47+0000;1461520547;2016-04-24 19:55:47;2;6;2;1;9;6;4;2;2;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I usually take my 12 week old son with me and I place him in one of your marvellous trollies designed to carry a car seat which makes my life a lot easier .

Filled our car up before heading back Upto Scotland. My sister went in and paid and came back out. As we were sitting waiting on a friend coming out  one of your members of staff came out with 2 Scottish £20 notes that my sister had handed over and proceeded to tell us that they can t be accepted as they are  old notes  even although they had already been through the till and change handed over to my sister. We told her that it was sterling and legal tender and the reply we got was we don t accept Scottish money. Personally I think this is ridiculous and disgusting behaviour and was totally uncalled for! As someone who travels regularly from Scotland down to England this is the first I ve experienced this at one of your branches. If tesco do not accept Scottish notes maybe there should be notices up to prevent further embarrassment!;;;;;2016-04-24T14:57:54+0000;1461509874;2016-04-24 16:57:54;2;21;2;1;24;20;6;14;6;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

This lady I think suffers with some sort of mental and learning difficulties. She was very upset and shouting. The lady at customer services called sue really showed the woman comfort and support and mostly compassion and helped calmed the lady down. She took the time to talk to this woman while everyone else was staring. The lady said she had no family to turned to and I heard sue say you can always turn to us (tesco) This woman at your superstore is remarkable she didn t have to spend the time with the distressed lady but she did with a kind loving heart. I just want to thank you for hiring a remarkable woman  I worked with people with mental and physical disabilities and not many people cared for those like sue did today with that lady. This visit to your store just for a little shopping left me feeling happy and it filled my heart knowing there is still kind people out in the world today!;;;;;2016-04-24T14:33:04+0000;1461508384;2016-04-24 16:33:04;6;0;7;0;7;0;0;0;0;0;5;1;0;0;0;0;0

My 3 year old was desperate for the toilet  he was jumping around trying to hold it in and was starting to panic. My husband asked a staff member if he could kindly accompany himself and our son to the toilet  and it was a downright  No it is impossible . My husband asked again  another downright  No. We ended up having to take him out onto the main road to do what he needed to do and noticed he had soiled himself as a result. I really hope this embarassment never happens to your children.;;;;;2016-04-23T21:24:23+0000;1461446663;2016-04-23 23:24:23;0;30;3;0;33;28;4;24;37;0;0;0;0;0;0;3;0

I doubt I will see anything done differently though. it seems there is never a trip where I DON T see children allowed to sit inside the trollies.   does tesco ever intend to enforce this rule? if not  why even bother having the sign on the handle that this is not allowed.;;;;;2016-04-23T16:29:30+0000;1461428970;2016-04-23 18:29:30;4;8;5;0;13;8;1;7;0;0;3;0;0;0;1;0;0

I went in to buy two loaves of bread and some bananas. Stood in the queue for nearly ten minutes waiting to be served by the single checkout operator who was also tasked to sell scratch card lottery tickets as well as serving people buying groceries. I have no desire to use the self service terminals in this store as they are always going out of order.  In the end I left the queue and  like so many others who use this store - or rather try to  I dumped the basket  on the one of the many unmanned service areas and walked out and went else where for what i needed.  This is par for the course for this store and has been since the day the opened. The only alteration is that this store gets worse and worse with each passing month.  It s disgraceful the way this store is run and managed. Queues are allowed to back up right up to the far end of the store up to the freezer units creating not only a health and safety hazard but customer s stepping on each other s feet and bumping into each other trying to get past. And it doesn t matter how many times people  in the queue for another checkout to be opened - it goes ignored - and is quite infuriating when there is one person behind the counter serving and another person behind the counter solely just to feed all the takings from the self service machine into a coin counter - ignoring the ever expanding queue of people waiting to be served. It s even more infuriating when  on the vary rare occasion  that there are two people serving that one has to spend most of that time hovering about the self service terminals section   correcting  all the technical issues and malfunctions which seem to constantly plague these  self service  machines. And as for the hygiene standard - this store is filthy. The crud and filth that has accumulated on the checkout counters is disgusting. And the state of the ice cream cabinet in the corner of the isle is chocking - pure filth. An issue I will be bringing to the attention of the Environment Dept with the local authority.;;;;;2016-04-23T14:12:17+0000;1461420737;2016-04-23 16:12:17;0;11;0;0;11;11;2;9;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Her two wishes were to marry her long term boyfriend and then to go home to die.   I believe the Marie Curie nurses contacted your Lincoln Tesco store (she was in the Lincoln County Hospital so I am presuming it was the closest one to it) to tell them of the situation and they had a wedding to organise    Tesco then took over and they organised an amazing buffet including bucks fizz  flowers  sandwiches  snacks  rolls  cakes and the most beautiful part was the personalised wedding cake  which had obviously had been hand written with beautiful icing flowers that were also hand made. This was then sent across to the hospital all within a few hours of hearing about the wedding taking place  and only 8 hours after she received the life shattering news  and all of this was done free of charge!   During the course of that awful day and night I can not tell you how much it made our family smile and praise Tesco for their kindness and the effort that went in. Nothing is going to cure my beautiful cousin  but in the face of such darkness  a company the size of Tesco stepped above and beyond and showed how much they cared  this one act will stay with me and my family for ever and I would be pleased if you could pass our thanks and appreciation to your wonderful team  you should be proud to have them in your team  I am certainly proud to tell this story  as the general public are very quick to criticise when a business gets it wrong but not quick enough to praise them when they get it right.;;;;;2016-04-23T10:58:05+0000;1461409085;2016-04-23 12:58:05;23146;909;25221;3620;29750;904;868;36;378;0;22895;1565;46;4;433;0;0

I shop with you every week on line and have my order delivered. Two doors down also do the same thing. In fact most weeks we both book the 8-9 slot on a Saturday. However our deliveries come on different vans normally at The same time or within a few minutes of each other. Surely it would be more cost effective to send the same van to the same road at the same time. Also better for the environment if deliveries for the same area are grouped together?;;;;;2016-04-23T07:43:46+0000;1461397426;2016-04-23 09:43:46;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My wife took my twins (5 years old) in for a treat. My boy decided on a Cadburys chocolate log  only to be told at the till that he couldn t have it because  it was not on file  a bit abruptly! Obviously he was heartbroken  (little things matter a lot at 5 years old) I returned to the store where the item had been quickly removed from the shelf. I asked at  customer services  and was very quickly passed to the store manager  who apologised and gave (free of charge) the muchly desired chocolate log. Thus ending my boys sobbing!  So  bad point....... Abrupt staff who didn t care less about a boys feelings.  Good point... A very nice  competent manager who solved the problem in seconds.  Ps I had already bought a different chocolate log  so my boy now has 2! More exercise needed tomorrow!

I get your trying to reduce the cost of your veg. But please stop. I brought my veg from you cos it was good  lasted and even the basic stuff was tastey and good Quality. Am really disappointed  it maybe less money  but looks like less in a packed  doesn t last as long and black and damaged more. Am not impressed. I went to you over cheaper shops  as your veg was such good quality  since you rebranded it to this made up farm name stuff  I ve been nothing but disappointed! :(;;;;;2016-04-22T13:34:01+0000;1461332041;2016-04-22 15:34:01;1;2;1;0;3;2;2;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

My nan and grandad have lived in Risca 15 years and was so excited tesco built an extra store 5 mins away from there house. My grandparents shopped at tesco every week. When my nan was ill at home last year some of the staff noticed they hadn t seen my grandparents for a few weeks so laura dropped round to see if they were okay. As nan got better she started shopping again. Sadly my nan passed away on the 3rd of April this year and again laura popped into my granddads house to see why she hadnt seen my nan for a while and obviously found out about my nan. A few days later Laura popped round with a card of condolence and said if my granddad needed anything to let her know.

I am really disappointed  I guess the customer service rep I spoke to is also on the same contract that Rukah is on as the manager Florence told me  Tesco does not pay for any overtime  it does not matter if it s a minute .;;;;;2016-04-21T23:24:56+0000;1461281096;2016-04-22 01:24:56;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

You book a delivery slot and get a text message to say it s going to be 30 mins late ..  Ok that s not really a problem.  Tesco van turns up and 2 drivers sit outside chatting.  You don t go out cause you just assume they are taking a break.  15 mins later they leave.  You call Tesco to ask what s going on to be told  the driver could t find your house  called and left a message.  Customer advised to rebook delivery.   Right  unless I m suddenly incapable of hearing my phone  seeing a missed call  noticing / getting a text to say you have a new message - the driver is spinning a yarn!  The guy on the end of a phone is called Taz and consistently uses the phrase  to be honest  which actually just infuriated me to boiling point can t help - had no way to contact the driver  does not listen to me I tell him that I can t understand why the driver couldn t find my house when he was sat outside it for 15 mins!  So Taz responds with I ll rearrange delivery for you for tomorrow and I won t charge you the £6.50 delivery.  Wow thanks!  Earliest delivery  they can offer me is 10am tomorrow - just perfect when you need things for 8.30am tomorrow..  Tesco you ve done yourself proud here with a very loyal customer.... And to top it all off when I suggested you might want to consider some vouchers for the shocking service - the response I get is  I m not charging you £6.50 delivery for tomorrow ....  Just marvellous!  Rant over!!!;;;;;2016-04-21T22:01:59+0000;1461276119;2016-04-22 00:01:59;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My mother stopped by for a quick food shop accompanied by my brother and while walking through one of the vegetable produce isles she slipped and fell.   Why? Because there was so much rubbish (various veggies and mess) on the floor that she skidded with her walking stick and landed hard on her one good knee and the arm that supported her. She is -- and has been -- disabled for many years after Polio left her right leg practically unusable even with a caliper.   This is the first time she has ever had a fall in that Tesco s store and as a family we ve been visiting it for as long as I can remember so it gives a little bit of an impression how standards appear to have dropped.   I understand you can have a bad day  you can be short-staffed  you can have all the excuses in the world to make a mistake  but when my mum sat there with a cup of tea being looked after by one of the lovely staff members (sorry I have no idea who it was but my mum said she was so attentive and caring  and really appreciated her help)  the manager however  was busy on the phone to the claims line covering their backside and trying to play the whole situation down like it s nothing.   When a disabled lady slips and falls in your store because of your manager s negligence of hygiene and maintenance  then running off the claims line is the last thing that manager should be doing.   I doubt my mum will do anything other than spend the next week or so struggling just a little bit more now her already weakening body has taken another hit. She s more forgiving than most. I won t ignore that she was given the groceries (a few ready meals  condiments  and veggies probably totaling less than £15) for free as a good will gesture too  which was nice because I know some some places wouldn t even bat an eyelid.   Hopefully this reads properly to those who see it  and the message gets across. Oh and if it gets deleted I ll be happy to post the backup copy across pretty much every social network possible.   To break it down  sort out the standards in your disgusting Thetford store and get a manager in there who actually gives a rats-a about their job and responsibilities.;;;;;2016-04-21T20:58:15+0000;1461272295;2016-04-21 22:58:15;3;3;4;0;7;3;1;2;2;0;3;0;0;0;1;0;0

A few hours ago  after just having our hair done (my 13 year old daughter who is on spectrum and has dyspraxia as well as other disabilities and I) we popped into tesco.  I have been really ill since last July with acute bacterial bronchopneumonia (had it back 7 or 8 times and have had countless steroids and penicillin) and it was a treat to have our hair done as I have only been out 5 or 6 times since July. Anyway  I parked in a mother and child bay thinking it was a disabled bay.  As we got out of the car the man parked in the bay beside me said  you aren t meant to park there  and words to the effect that I had to move. I asked him why & he said  it s for children!   He was really getting quite rude and obnoxious.  I said I would move but said to him there was no need to be rude. He said  my wife is the manager at Tesco and she will tell you . The wife said  your  parking is over there!  Said in the same tone as the husband quite abruptly.  The husband then went on to say  we aren t allowed to park in  your  bays  I said OK  went to get back in my car and the man said  anyway  what is your disability  being fat .  This is an utterly disgusting thing to say and in front of my daughter.  This comes at a time when the dispatches program  which was on the other night  exposed one of their assessors bragging that he got paid £20 000 a month to do assessments and all the other derogatory and inflamatory things that he said.  Genuine people that have disabilities are treated badly enough by the government  as it is  with the horrendous assessments we have to go through but you certainly do not want or indeed expect to have this type of abuse when you are just out and about minding your own business.  I was upset so I went to customer services in the Lowestoft Yarmouth store and a manager called Steve (that had been there since 2001) came to see me.  The lady on customer service practically had to almost beg him to come down and explained everything that had happened to him on the phone.  He said  what s the problem!   He said there wasn t much he could do because it s probably just a shopper!  Perhaps I could check CCTV but then I am not back in until tuesday etc  etc! This is how the conversation went until I asked my daughter  is it me or does he seem like he is not bothered about what had just happened? My daughter agreed and I then asked him why he didn t even want to take my name etc. In the end I just said don t bother and we walked out. I rang head office and first of all I was told that the child bay s are up to 5 years old as the bay s are for getting children out of the car safely. I said that I didn t know that but with a daughter on the autism spectrum (she is not road aware) and also falls so I have to hold her hand etc  then the bay s should also be for children like this. He went on to say that because it was a shopper saying what he said  there was nothing they could do! My daughter reminded me what the wife (the tesco manager) said and he then said that he would investigate!  I have been really upset all afternoon and so has my daughter and that is why I felt I had to post this.  Because the little weazle of a man wound his window up after he called me fat he might not have heard my reply so here it isn t!   One. You must be very proud of the example of a father  man and human being  that you are showing to your children. Two. I can lose weight but you are stuck with that face for the rest of your life! The way in which Tesco has handled this is utterly disgusting and the 2 poor excuses of human beings need to take a long hard look in the mirror and really think about what they did today in front of my 13 year old daughter. Please feel free to share this post and sorry it s so long. Thankyou (X-Tesco shopper);;;;;2016-04-21T16:55:05+0000;1461257705;2016-04-21 18:55:05;1;36;1;0;37;32;10;22;44;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

My rant exceeds that limit.   I have just been told by Indesit that the washing machine I was expecting today can t be delivered because the driver has a bad back... seconds after I saw him drive off.   While I ve always been satisfied with the level of customer service Tesco has continuously given me over the years I feel Indesit have totally let you down today.   Here is a copy of the email I have sent to Indesit customer services:  Dear Indesit  RE: Order number 49GXQQW6G-1  After placing an order for a washing machine (plus free recycling) through Tesco directly on the phone and stating very clearly that I live in a block of flats  I have just been told that it’s not possible to get it today as the driver has a bad back.   I saw the truck pull up outside. A guy knocked on my door and said “I thought it was one flight of stairs  I’ll have to go and speak to the driver”.   He went away and I watched the lorry drive off.   He then called me to say that  because it was 3 flights of stairs  they’d have to reschedule delivery.   I telephone your customer services only to be told that a traffic warden had moved them on.   My wife was standing on the balcony all the time the lorry was there. We have deliveries daily and never has a traffic warden moved on a delivery truck. That was the first blatant lie.   When I contested this I was then told that the delivery driver “may have been alone”  which wasn’t the case as the driver’s mate said to me that he was going to speak to the driver.  Then I was told that the delivery driver has hurt his back.  Did he hurt his back driving here? At what point did the guy who delivers washing machines for a living decide that his back was too poorly to deliver a washing machine today?  When he took one look at my stairs no doubt.  I now have to take more time off work on the hope that a guy with a good back can deliver it on Monday.  I’ve decommissioned my old washing machine so can’t even get a wash on until then.   Absolutely pathetic service.   Don’t even bother apologising  it means nothing.   Regards   John Squirrell.

Wed my order appears but only 1kg instead of 5. Bear in mind this is an on offer item  the store called saying they had only 1kg delivered that day!!! I re order my delivery for today  1 hour ago i get a call saying that yet again the store only had 1.5 kg delivered on their delivery  they ordered 6 cases. So for 3 days now you cant supply an on offer item  its a con to get customers in store  when you dont really have the product. Sharp practice tesco and Dodgy dealing. Crikey all i am asking for is 5 kg of bloody cod loins! Fish historically is and was the country s national dish!! Please pass this on to the relevant person  or somone who knows JESUS CHRIST personally  I heard a rumour he could turn 3 small fishes into enough to feed the multitudes.

I was doing my shopping around 9.30pm when approaching the fresh bread and cakes area I noticed some jam doughnuts reduced from 50p to 33p (not a lot of saving) so I picked up 2 packets when turning around to continue my shopping two ladies from the store were throwing all the rest of the reduced Items in large orange recycling bags there was 4 full stacked on a cage I was disgusted that all that waste was being thrown there are so many people going hungry and the store is open till 12am so why not reduced to 10p put at the front of the store so the customers can buy them rather than throw good food away or even give it to food banks I know that you cant sell past their sell buy date but at least give customers a chance to use the food and the staff that goes in at 12 could get rid of the waste then I would have quite happily have given them £5 for the lot but as I can see Tesco s never give anything away even the reduced items only have a couple of pence off but as I m a mother of a large family would have happily bought the reduced goods given the chance because if we hadn t have got there when we did the doughnuts I bought would have ended up in the recycle bags with the rest of them.;;;;;2016-04-21T08:22:10+0000;1461226930;2016-04-21 10:22:10;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I’ve tried contacting you via your website’s feedback form on Monday 17th April 2016 and unfortunately I have not received any feedback from your side be it from email or phone call. So  this is my next effort in getting in touch with you as I can’t get any solution from your Seremban 2 Store.  Below is the information I posted on your company’s website last Monday. I really seek your cooperation in settling this issue as soon as possible. Thank you. Hi and good day   I would like to bring your attention to a problem that I faced in Tesco Seremban 2 that have happened on two occasions: 20th Feb. 2016 and 21st Feb 2016. I have tried to settle this issue for almost 2 months with the store manager Muhammad Hafiz  but he has failed to help me resolve my problem.  20th Feb 2016: I shopped at your outlet and my total bill was RM522.95. I paid using debit card via current account. During the first attempt  the cashier claimed that the transaction was unsuccessful  and they tried it for the second time also claiming it was unsuccessful. For the third time  I asked the cashier to charge on to my saving account and the transaction was successful. Unfortunately  when I checked my bank statement  it was stated that 2 deductions amounting RM 522.95 per transaction were charged to my current accoount.  21st Feb 2016 I shopped again at your store and at 9.27am during payment  the same problem happened during my payment. The cashier claimed payment via current account from my debit card failed and then the card was swiped again for payment from saving account.  And again  when I checked my bank statement  there were two deductions for my purchase on the 21st. All this while  I contacted the store manager Mr Muhammad Hafiz and he has provided me email print outs regarding the conversation between S2 store and Jia Ying Lim. In one of the email  it stated that Tesco has already refunded on 23March. But  this is not true. I have not received any refund from your side. The total amount that should be refunded to me is RM1385.15. I have already contacted my bank - Maybank about this matter and they claimed that there is no communication from your side to refund my money. This problem has prolong for almost 2 months and this morning was the last straw as your store manager Mr Muhammad Hafiz claimed that the person in charge Jia Ying Lim has resigned and there s nothing else can be done to refund my money.  So  Tesco my question is: Is this how you treat your customer? Your loyal customer to be precise  as I shopped daily at Tesco S2 outlet Is Jia Ying Lim is the only person responsible on my money? Without this person  Tesco is malfuctioning? When can I get my money back. More than 1k has been ripped off from me for almost two months which can be used for my business.  I have all the original receipts  email communication print outs if your side is interested to settle this matter.Kindly give me the email address to send all the particulars. It is very embarrassing that this incident happened in a very large establishment as this can be prevented earlier during closing while printing the credit / debit card settlement report  because isn t it obvious that the total amount does not tally? I really hope that you can make the necessary actions to refund my money as soon as possible so that I do not need to take further action.  Thank you in advance for your kind and immediate response.  *Edited:  RM RM 522.95 was refunded to my account on 18th April.;;;;;2016-04-21T01:44:53+0000;1461203093;2016-04-21 03:44:53;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I noticed that the waistband and sticky tabs have changed to be a little more stretchy which is good  but am also finding them not very good at absorbing odour. Has the absorbency also changed when the waistband designed changed?  I thought it was a one off at first but we’ve gone through 3 packets now and still finding the strong smell of wee quite unpleasant.

On Tuesday this week I received a call from my delivery driver as he was outside (I wasn t home) I explained the misunderstanding and he said he would rectify this back at the store. I then checked the app and it just shows the original delivery details and contents and no sign of my rearranged delivery. Today I have been charged £24.43 for a delivery I did not want and have no goods to show for this.  I have been a delivery saver customer for 3yrs and am very disappointed. This is the 1st issue I have had with Tesco and am puzzled as to why the original order was not cancelled as I had requested.  Please can you advise how I can proceed with this further.;;;;;2016-04-20T20:15:51+0000;1461183351;2016-04-20 22:15:51;0;5;0;0;5;5;1;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was taken to hospital early this morning by ambulance and missed my delivery . As soon as I contacted you to rearrange I was treated like a star. Thankyou for arranging my delivery for later today . I then got  a call off Anita from the Crosspoint store to check if I was ok and that delivery later today was ok for me . The driver has just arrived with my shopping and a bunch of roses and a get well card .

I just witnessed threatening behaviour by one.of the cashiers at tesco express  North oxhill road  handsworth. A pensioner was the target of aggressive and threatening behavior at the pensioner. A customer told the worker to have some respect for the pensioner and the worker said I don t care if he s old.  I am absolutely disgusted with the behaviour. The worker is an Asian male with curly hair and a slight beard.  This is bad publicity for tesco that they employ such people. The security guard had to warn the worker to calm down. This happened today at 20:10 and will be on Cctv. I am the one in the green check shirt.;;;;;2016-04-20T19:22:41+0000;1461180161;2016-04-20 21:22:41;0;5;0;0;5;5;1;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have seen two cars pull into parent and toddler spaces with...shock/horror no kids 😤. I can t understand it! I have 3 kids but being without them I pulled into a parking space 4 down in a normal space. And there they go swanning into to store  even though there were loads of normal spaces and disabled if needed! Nobody in store as far as I can see bothers checking the parking even though signs clearly state disabled/parent and toddler. I wouldn t be surprised if the disabled spaces are used like this also. It completely astounds me that people can have such little respect for such simple things which are there to make people s lives easier 😕.;;;;;2016-04-20T19:07:50+0000;1461179270;2016-04-20 21:07:50;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We live in a small remote community that is a very popular with tourists all year round and indeed is a regular stop off point on the North Coast 500 route a drive that has just been named most popular drive in the UK. I am very concerned that Tesco have decided to cease their click and collect service in the village for no apparent reason. The service is regularly used by locals not just the local business community and is often fully booked. With this in mind I cannot understand why you are stopping the service as the route that your service takes goes from Lairg to Wick via Kinlochbervie and subsequently has to pass through Durness anyway. I and many others in the community have been Tesco customers for many years and obviously we are feeling very let down by Tesco and your management. Is there any possibility for this decision to be reversed and if not can we at least have an honest explanation as to the reason behind your decision. If you are not prepared to provide an understandable reason I will have no choice but to inform all my visitors this year of the lack of caring that Tesco show to our community. In addition I will be in touch with the management of Asda in Tain to try and organise an alternative service.;;;;;2016-04-20T14:25:09+0000;1461162309;2016-04-20 16:25:09;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Durness is a village that has B&B s like myself and rely on Tesco s. Durness is a very busy place with Tourists It s so disappointing that they have stopped right on the season starting. What we don t understand is they are going to Kinlochbervie 7 days a week so why can t they deliver too Durness on there way passed ?? I ve phoned the manager in Wick and too say he was unprofessional and rude was a understatement . Also sent 2 emails too yourselves and no questions answered. Yes we understand that 3 days is not paying but 1 day at least would defiantly pay. What about home delivery ? You do home delivery to the other village beside us Tongue. I think that Tesco s has let this small community down badly. Look forward too hearing back from you ASAP with proper answers.

A problem with Appliances Direct (a purchase made through the Tesco Direct website) was being compounded by their false promises and their refusal to admit they were wrong.  Doreen took ownership of the problem. She was tenacious. She has called me every time she promised to and explained the process throughout. She has been friendly and pleasant throughout.  Customer Service at its best. Well done!;;;;;2016-04-20T10:03:17+0000;1461146597;2016-04-20 12:03:17;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I bought a cooker last Thursday and received an email stating that it would be delivered and installed on or before Wednesday 20th April. I had not heard anything so I emailed yesterday to see what time it would come.  I eventually got a call back today from Hotpoint Logistics  who are delivering on behalf of Tesco and they informed me it won t be arriving until Wednesday 27th. I have no cooker and 2 children. I would not have ordered from Tesco if I had known I would be waiting 2 weeks. Before I ordered it said delivery on or before 20th.

To those that know about it  they would spot it but for the local shopper in Maryhill they would not know what the Halal logo is and what goes on with it.  I am not happy at all that you have decided to sell Halal meat/livestock products.  The process in which the animal goes through to be slaughtered is barbaric.  It causes so much pain and suffering.  I am sure you are fully aware of the process.  I would not wish this on ANY living thing.  I ask that you reconsider selling these Halal products to help cut out on animal cruelty.  I wish to hear back on this matter  as if it is something that will continue to happen  then I would be looking to take my custom else where.  I use Tesco not only for my food shopping but also Petrol station and Finance products.  It deeply offends me that Tesco would be willing to allow suffering to animals by putting them through this process.    I look forward to hearing a reply.

We booked a home delivery for the 4th consecutive week..... Your driver couldn t find my house!  He had the postcode  he had the door number  He found the street  but not the house. The door has the house number on. The gate has the house number on. Each of the 3 wheelie bins has the number on and all 3 face the road (and they are day glow yellow)  Only a blind person could fail to spot the numbers on the house!  Yet your driver managed! I called at 9.54pm to find out if everything was OK as we were booked for a 9-10pm spot. I was told he couldn t find the house and he may be a new driver. The lady spoke to him and came back to say he was 4 miles away and would call me on the house phone shortly so I could talk him to my house.  I called back at 10.25pm again as the driver hadn t been in touch. The gentleman contacted the driver again  who now said he couldn t deliver as he was running late and didn t have time.  After some discussion it was decided that I would take my car to meet the delivery driver  who would call me in a few minutes to arrange where we could meet. I was given the drivers number incase he didn t call me (07xxx182679) I called several times from 10.55pm and didn t get an answer. Then I recived an email to advise my order had been cancelled and rescheduled for between 8pm and 9pm the following day.  Firstly   my street has 40-50 houses in and had been her for at least 50 years.  The postcode puts you to number 18 on a Tomtom which is just round the corner.  To find your way from number 18 you count the houses  or to be totally radical and think outside the box  you look at the doors for the NUMBERS!  It s suprisingly easy  taxi drivers  ambulances  police officers and various delivery drivers have managed to find the house without getting lost over the last 4 years I ve lived here!  But what s more frustrating then the incompetent driver not being able to find the house  it s the fact that 2 different members of your call centre team have out and out lied to me about the order  thus resulting in the order not being made and me spending 2 hours sat waiting for a delivery that was never going to happen!   You have now taken the money from my account for today s shopping (which will be refunded in 5 days or so) and you re going to collect more money tomorrow as the special offers we had selected ended today!!!!!  If your company is happy to accept drivers who can t find houses by looking at door numbers  and call centre workers who can t tell the truth I feel that it s maybe best if we part company  I m sorry  but as things stand next week I will be trying out ASDA S home delivery service.   I will add it s very much not me  it s YOU!;;;;;2016-04-19T22:34:35+0000;1461105275;2016-04-20 00:34:35;3;3;4;0;7;3;3;0;1;0;3;0;0;0;0;1;0

I have already contacted your customer service team via online message and have received an almost duplicate reply as the previous week (although this was through a phone call). This does not fill me with confidence as to the possibility of an improvement. A bit of back ground I have been a loyal customer of yours for several years and spend in excess of 7K a year across your brands and have been using your home delivery service approaching 2 years. Below is a copy of my Messages for the past two weeks and the one typed reply (dated today) I have received.   I hope you can agree that this really does not make for good customer service and would appreciate another view point from Tescos.   My messages (the two I have copies of) Hi  I have just unpacked my delivery and once again I have items that do not meet your use by date promises. As follows: Clementines dated 14/4/16  Spring Onions 13/4/16 Crumpets 14/4/16 Last week I was promised that the store concerned would be informed and this would not happen again. Unfortunately things have gotten worse.  Additionally while the other items meet your use by date promises  I have only two products that actually exceed them. Whilst I appreciate that by their very nature fresh products have only short dates  I know by experience that longer dates would be available on most of them. Can I ask are you re pickers instructed to pick those items with the shortest date but that meet you re minimum promises?  I hope that you will be able to help with the above    Hi  As a follow on from last weeks feedback  this week all items are in date. But as last week  every single item matches the guaranteed days and apart from the dairy goods not a day more. I was assured last week that you would speak to the store as I was assured that the pickers should not be picking to only the shortest dates available. Today I was in a Tesco store and looked at the dates for the products. Apart from a couple of items (fresh fruit) the other items were available for longer dates then your minimum guarantees. So it is somewhat unbelievable that out of an entire shop not one product exceeded your given dates.  Unfortunately I shop on line to shop for the best I can for a week  with this situation recurring that is not possible. I will no longer be ordering fresh produce from yourselves and will stick to dry goods  and at the end of my delivery saver I will be looking for a alternative seller.   And Tescos reply. Thanks for your email. I’m responding on behalf of my colleague Russell  I hope you don’t mind. Firstly  I’m sorry if a number of items received as part of today’s online grocery order were at the minimum of our advised freshness guarantees. I can appreciate any disappointment this would cause  particularly if you contacted us last week with similar concerns about the dates that you’d received. Whilst I’m unsure as to which store you visited  I can advise that your orders are sent from our Dereham branch if you were unaware. Following on from my colleague’s report to the store last week  I’ll be sure to address this with the Home Shopping Manager at Dereham in an effort to ensure that the pickers are offering the longest possible dates available to them at the time of picking as we would expect. Now it might be the case that you were offered the longest dates that they had but I’ll happily raise this with the store and I’m hopeful that you’ll notice an improvement going forwards. In conclusion  I appreciate you taking the time to get in touch but if you have any further queries  please don t hesitate to contact us at: online@tesco.co.uk.;;;;;2016-04-19T19:51:55+0000;1461095515;2016-04-19 21:51:55;0;4;0;0;4;4;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My partner and I were just in your Transit Way branch and I can honestly say we received the worst service we have ever experienced.   We went to a checkout that was empty and started putting our shopping on the conveyor. As we approached the till staff  we were completely ignored as he was having a light hearted conversation with another colleague that just kept coming over and standing near the checkout to chat with him. When I say we were ignored  what I actually mean is: - We were not greeted. - We were not asked if we had or required bags. - He just started scanning stuff and sliding it towards us (hadn t even made eye contact and was still in discussion with his colleague.) - We had to interrupt him to ask for a wine carrier (which he got out without saying a word to us but still chatting with his colleague.) - Once everything was scanned he just carried on chatting and my partner held her club card out to him waiting for him to respond. - He scanned it (still without speaking to us or even letting us how much the total was.) - My partner put her payment card in the machine without any clue of the total and not a word from the cashier.) - Once the transaction was completed  he handed us our receipt and said  cheers  whilst STILL not even looking at us and paying full attention to his colleague.  We picked up our shopping and left. I would have complained to the team leader/manager running the front end but unfortunately that was the colleague that our cashier was chatting to.  I personally was absolutely disgusted with the service and working in the public domain and in customer service myself  if I had seen a member of my staff act in that way it would not have gone unnoticed and I DEFINITELY wouldn t have been there encouraging it.

The home built BBQ is still a pile of bricks but me and the family thought it would be great to eat outside. I popped to your Fraserburgh store and grabbed some sausages  chicken and buns  and I also picked up a disposable BBQ  In fact they were such a good price I picked up 3. (Yes I am in Scotland but was feeling optimistic.)It took me all 3 family party grills to cook 4 sausages and 3 chicken legs and in the end we cooked them in our kitchen. They didn t work folks.  I was a student so have used these hundreds of times before with no problems but all three were duds. lots of flame then nothing  an hour later all the coals still black and no heat.

Only realised when I went shopping back here in Kent earlier today. Phoned the store spoke to customer services. Confirmed card was there. She suggested my brother could collect it. I said no as he s a vulnerable adult. But asked if my husband could as I had to go to work. Bear in mind it s a 120 mile round trip  fuel and crossing charges. She said yes that s fine. Tell him to bring ID. Told her we have same account so he can show her his bank card and drivers licence. She said that s perfect. He gets there an hour later only to be told they can t give him it and only I can pick it up. So now I have to do another 120 mile round trip more fuel and crossing charges!

One time the sandwich dried out before I could eat it  I still had to as there was no choice. Another time the filling leaked out into the rest of the things in my briefcase.  A month ago  I was charged full price for sandwiches that were marked down for immediate sale. This was because the floor staff did nothing to obscure the normal barcode.  What is the response each time? Bring it back with the receipt and we can give you a refund. How useless is that? If I don t eat it  I have no lunch that day. There is no where to buy a replacement within miles.   This is why I go to the Coop or Sainsbury s when there s a choice. Tesco s only form of customer service is a blank apology and no effort to fix broken processes.;;;;;2016-04-19T07:04:24+0000;1461049464;2016-04-19 09:04:24;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Though I think there is still more tesco can do. It isn t just about diet but animal welfare and the environmental issues at stake. There is so much animal abuse either at farms  especially intensive farming of livestock and also in slaughter houses. A plant based diet has always  and will always be healthier than a heavy dairy and meat based diet. The obesity crisis can be helped by a plant based diet  not to mention type 2 diabetes  heart disease and many other conditions. The meat and dairy industries are a drain on resources  ie food and water. They are also massively subsidised by the tax payer.  I also know that Quorn are going fully vegan purely by demand  by leaving out egg in the mixture. I have yet to see any in tesco stores. I cannot eat too much soya so I and many others are awaiting these products.;;;;;2016-04-19T07:01:03+0000;1461049263;2016-04-19 09:01:03;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Our house burnt down on 1st April destroying everything we own.  I went into tesco in havant to get some items we needed for the house and to ask for some hangers as we have none.  The 2 young ladies in the clothing section said not a problem and would get a large box of the for me for free. When they came back with them they brought to senior staff members too. The 2 girls had told them what had happened to our house and said they would sort out the list if items I needed to get and took me to the cafe for a cup of tea.  This was above and beyond anything I could imagine. They were so lovely and caring just as everyone has been since this terrible accident happened.

Tonight I needed to place a large order for guests arriving tomorrow.  However I am being  blocked  from entering the site.  The possible reasons given are that my address is invalid or there is a problem with the address they have for me on the system.

Having recently returned home after surgery I was very grateful to be able to place an online order and have it delivered to my home. I chose things that I thought would make it easy to feed my family and myself while I recover  and tonight s choice was Cottage Pie... What a disappointment. The layer of meat/veg/gravy was so thin as to be nonexistent at places across the pie - nothing like the picture shown on the sleeve. According to your packaging the pie serves four but using the meat from the whole pie and the potato from half I only managed to create two almost decent servings  one each for my partner and seven year old son...

I know you already offer support in other directions but I have a simple solution to public speculation. At the end of every day the food bank box is passed through a till and the calculated profit donated directly to the food banks. This would be of double benefit to the food banks and still not cost you any more than a little lost profit. Every little counts.;;;;;2016-04-18T13:31:53+0000;1460986313;2016-04-18 15:31:53;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I just received a very poor service from your customer service team through Tesco Direct which I was very shocked with as I have always had a good experience with your team. I received a faulty item from one of your partners and the woman I spoke to about it was very rude  patronising in her manner and very unhelpful. At one point I couldnt hear her and she shouted down the phone. She just sounded like she did not want to be there and after I said that I could not be in from Monday-Friday for the partner to pick up the faulty item and could they issue me with a returns label instead she sounded very irritable and said that the partner has only said between those days which I think is unfair as why should I take time off work to wait for somebody to collect an item that was faulty to begin with?? Her attitude was terrible and she practically put the phone down on me. After the call I am still none the wiser on what to do with my faulty item! Could you please advise? I feel very let down. Thanks Cathy;;;;;2016-04-18T11:24:53+0000;1460978693;2016-04-18 13:24:53;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have complained twice to customer service over 3 mths and to date it remains the same.  I don t eat animals bodies or their by-products. When I go to the vegetarian/vegan freezer section to buy my food   I don t expect to have severed legs and limbs of animals on sale  scattered amongst the food I have to look at and buy!  There is so little on offer that doesn t contained battered  abused broken bodies in the supermarket  and the few things that are actually on offer  I now will refuse to buy from tesco because of their stocking policy.  Tesco seem to think it is some  fad diet  so group it together with  free from anything you can think of  foods  so they put bags of dead chicken nuggets in the section  dead chicken medallions (whatever that is? lets just call it flesh shall we?) etc.  I happened to pick some up thinking I may just get some for the kids  assuming it was vegetarian since IT WAS in the VEGETARIAN section  but was horrified to find it wasn t!  maybe it s someones idea of a sick shelf stocking joke?  I have complained to customer service politely twice over the last 3 months and explained it from our point of view.  To those who eat the flesh of animals  they are desensitised to waht it actually is  so just think we are making a  fuss over nothing .  From the point of view of people who abstain from these foods  we see  when we look in the freezer  not just a misplaced box of food  but infact the broken torn body parts of the most abused kind of animals in the agriciultural industry- A chicken  who is unfortunate enough to live only a short 35 days (instead of 10-20 yrs) and then cruelly slaughtered  all so they can become junk food.  It is highly offensive that Tesco is so inconsiderate in the respect and i am fed up with our supermarket doing nothing about it.  Would you put Pork legs in the Kosher section of a London supermarket? I think probably not.  Please be considerate and make it an across the board stocking policy in EVERY  store   that in at least ONE  area of the supermarket  we are not having abused animals shoved in our face whilst we are trying to shop? Until that time  I have decided that we will no longer be purchasing any products from that section.  Thank you.;;;;;2016-04-18T11:22:51+0000;1460978571;2016-04-18 13:22:51;50;136;57;2;195;111;34;77;298;0;49;4;0;0;2;1;0

We decide to give the scan and pack devise another go  which I was dubious about because the last few times I d been subjected to random checks  and set off. We literally had less than 10 items in our bag and yet we still got a random check!   A young girl by the name of Georgie came over and when I explained to her that this was in fact the 4th time I d been  chosen  for a random check she said that that s what happens for the first 6 times of using the service and that most people actually speak to a member of staff before registering. Well I didn t because there was no need I believed. You literally scan your clubcard  enter your postcode and accept the terms and conditions (which are so tiny on the screen you need a magnifying glass). Anyway after explaining this to Georgie  who by the way hadn t greeted us just literally started pulling all our shopping out of the bag  she got quite flippant and just kept repeating that most people speak to a member of staff and it happens the first 6 times. So I suggested that maybe there should be some kind of sign or something beside the scanners to warn customers of this and still Georgie just repeated herself over and over. By their point my partner and I were getting quite angry because  she just wasn t listening to us and this whole time hadn t even bothered to look at us.   Finally she finished what she had to do  snatched the basket from the stand  turned her back and flounced off! No sorry for the inconvenience  no I ll forward your suggestion literally nothing. She just stomped off like a child. I d had enough so asked her colleague for a manager  who came pretty quickly but was very nervous. I explained what had happened and all he did was repeat what Georgie said about how the system does random checks the first 6 shops lol (not quite random if it s actually going to happen each time). He explained that it was in the T&Cs that you agree to when registering so I again suggested that part be more clearly stated. I said that my real problem wasn t the stupid rules of the scanning it was in fact the rudeness and compete ignorance of his member of staff (who by the was was around the corner crying to a customer who had walked in saying how if been horrible to her) and all he said was he d have a word. He did apologise but it was quite back handed especially when he said that Georgie was only doing her job trying to explain the system.   Honestly Customer Service is not complicated. Speak politely and treat customers who are spending money in your shop with respect. That s what you get paid for. This whole situation has put me off using the scan and pack again. I thought the point was to be able to get in and out quickly but yesterday it took as long to check out with under 10 items than it would if I had a massive trolley full.;;;;;2016-04-18T06:35:53+0000;1460961353;2016-04-18 08:35:53;0;13;0;0;13;12;7;5;21;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My mum and I popped into the store at Great Notley as we have done regularly since the store first opened  but today was different.... My mum was aggressively bullied by a fellow customer as she waited patiently for staff to bring out the discounted fresh food. This particular customer not only got verbally abusive but also physical  to the point where he was pushing people out of the way to get to the items that were marked down. This customer made many of the women around increasingly uneasy and at one point they became rather scared by the behaviour of this man  resulting my mum making a complaint and speaking to the Duty Manager about this incident...  This is not the first time this customer has pushed people out of the way to get to what he wants  a few days ago a small girl was pushed to the ground. I have witnessed a lot of aggressive behaviour between customers when I have been in the store as produce is being discounted  I completely understand that Tesco need to protect their staff  but this is totally beside the point... On a number of occasions I have witnessed staff just leave the trolley of food which has been marked down in the middle of an isle  this is only creating more problems as customers literally battle to get there first... If this continues someone is going to get seriously hurt.. I believe that the way this store marks down produce that is going out of date needs to be revisited... I expect to be able to shop in my local store in peace.;;;;;2016-04-17T19:28:39+0000;1460921319;2016-04-17 21:28:39;0;5;1;0;6;5;3;2;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am a mother of a multiple allergy child and I have been purchasing Bfree bread from your stores for some time as that is the ONLY bread my wheat egg dairy soya free child can eat. Sometimes when I try to buy It the bread is out of stock but recently I haven t seen it at all  no ticket etc. last night I spoke to a duty manager from your Toton branch who couldn t really give me a straight answer to wether you still sell it or not but did mention they are having a brand reset which is where you get rid of the brands that don t sell well. So I ask you -  How can you get rid of a brand that is mostly out of stock because it doesn t sell well?  Why if you have gotten rid of the brand are you still selling the wraps? If you are no longer selling this brand are you looking to stock an alternative?  Being an allergy mum is bad enough without supermarkets changing things with no notice!!!  I can t wait to hear from you. Thanks X;;;;;2016-04-17T10:52:52+0000;1460890372;2016-04-17 12:52:52;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I put the order in a year ago  and just moved house. No problem you might think  the game has been delayed for another month  just change the address. Not so...  On enquiring about this I was told  essentially   Computer says no.....  and that they couldn t change the delivery address for whatever reason. Their ONLY suggestion? Cancel there order and replace it.   Ah  says I  that s a bit awkward as I placed the order via a special offer  and used Clubcard points to do it. I don t think you d be refunding me the value of the game so that I could simply reorder it? Or do you have any other suggestions or solutions? Could you change it to click and collect?  Nope. Only suggestion is to cancel. No options. No suggestions. No help. No customer care. Just cancel. I pushed a little  and subsequently was replied to by someone who called me by your staff members name ( Dianne? Really?) And then when i requested the issue was treated as a complaint  I was essentially told that the onus was on me to ensure that I PAID for a redirection  despite the fact that I was giving you a month s notice to change the address.   To call the service poor is an understatement. To say I m annoyed  even more so.

Jestem bardzo zawiedziony zakupami w Tesco na ulicy Długiej we Wrocławiu. Niejednokrotnie robiłem tam zakupy  nie raz nie pasowała mi jakość niektórych produktów  aczkolwiek mam tam najbliżej i nie stwarzałem problemów. Dzisiaj ze znajomymi kupiliśmy mięso na grila marki Tesco i kiełbaski marki Sokołów. Niestety po otwarciu opakowań wydobywał sie bardzo specyficzny i obrzydliwy zapach. Śmierdziało w całym domu przez długi czas mimo wietrzenia. Kiełbaski byly w dziwnej mazi  mięso było w przyprawach i wyglądało normalnie  jednak zapach był nie do zniesienia. Stwierdziliśmy  ze usmażymy je na grilu. Mięso smakowało jednak jak zepsute. Uważam  ze to miejsce jest słabo pilnowane i konsumenci mogą sie przez to struć i mieć problemy ze zdrowiem. Mimo bliskiej odległości nie zamierzam juz robić tam zakupów. Pisze to  ponieważ przestrzegam wszystkich okolicznych mieszkańców przed tym Tesco.;;;;;2016-04-16T16:43:24+0000;1460825004;2016-04-16 18:43:24;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Today we did our weekly tesco shop at tesco arena Coventry.At the entrance was a candy crush advertising team with two people dressed in shapes (faces Covered) when we entered one of the mascots were waving at our four year old daughter and she wanted to go back to see them at the end of our shopping trip.so as my partner was loading the shopping onto the belt I took my daughter to go and see the candy crush mascots.i stood a few steps back so she could go and say hello.she approached one and showed him/her the teddy she was holding.they took it from her hand and threw it across the floor I mean not just drop it but literally threw it  3 metres away! I m still in shock now that they have done this! A man and lady who were also there advertising saw the teddy on the floor and saw my daughter upset.they asked if it was my daughter or him that had thrown the teddy to which I replied him! They didn t apologise for having such an idiot of a colleague just shook there head.my 4 year old daughter came away upset which is quite understandable after this idiot of a person did this! All she wanted was a simple high five and hug but instead was face to face with a complete and utter imbecile.I m not one to make a scene but really wish I had now and got them to apologise face to face to my daughter.disgusting behaviour for anyone that is trying to sell a product to the public!  very unprofessional and obviously a child themselves thinking this is fun to do to a four year old little girl.;;;;;2016-04-16T15:55:00+0000;1460822100;2016-04-16 17:55:00;0;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

She did her shopping on scan as shop and got thru the tills before me as I had to use a checkout. She was waiting for me outside the shop sitting on the bench getting food out to feed her son. A few minutes later a security guard that goes by the name of munday approached her accusing her off stealing and told her she needed to get back in the store. She got up and went with him giving the security guard her receipt. He got all up in her face and was swearing at her she obviously told him to f#ck off and she called another security guard over which told this munday to go away which he refused kept antagonising the girl all of this in front of her son. She then called for a manager this point in tears. The security manager came named Brian was very rude to her she told him to check cctv and the nice security guard backed her up the manager then told  the nice security guard off in the cafe which we were moved into. I then tried to speak to this Brian to say I witnessed it and he said rubbish we asked to speak to store manager which he replied no chance and kicked us both out of the store. By this time my friend was on phone to police as the way the were treating her but because they didn t lay a hand on her is not a criminal offence for her to be treated this way and they didn t need to get involved because she had left the store and was no longer in fear. So if you want to be treated like that your sons  daughters  mums dad s  grandparents go shop in tesco riverfield drive Bedford.;;;;;2016-04-16T15:03:02+0000;1460818982;2016-04-16 17:03:02;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I asked the lady on the checkout and she said you sold them. She asked another member of staff to find one for me & he said we were both mistaken and they had never sold them in that store. I came home empty handed & spoke to my friend who indeed had purchased one from there. I then went back with her several hours later and asked a different member of staff who located me one.

As per usual whist I was selecting the soya milk of my choice near the cereal shelf an ignorant/thoughtless/senseless/ customer had placed a tub of Tesco s own brand of porridge only on the wrong shelf nearby. The staff are well aware of this attitude. It was my idea that all cashiers should have a box underneath the counter so that unwanted items can be placed back in their original position at the end of trading. This hasn t worked very well. At least if I see an item which is abandoned only yards away fom it s original position I put it back in it s position or hand it to a memer of staff. At lest I bought all my items without any problem and as not 1 but 3 customers behind me had only a few items in their basket compared to my 25 items.;;;;;2016-04-16T10:57:08+0000;1460804228;2016-04-16 12:57:08;0;16;0;0;16;12;5;7;12;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

First time I had ever been in the store.   I collect hotwheels cars so went to have a look what they had in a different store to my local. I spent about 2 mins browsing the toy section and the cars with no luck for what I was after.   Just as I was about to walk out the toy isle I got approached by a security guard and also a woman that looked like possibly the store manager.  Only to have them question me and make me look like some kind of shop lifter while everyone else in store was walking past looking.   I m 32 years old and I come in wearing a £120 jacket a pair of £80 jeans a £30 tshirt £150 glasses using my iPhone 6. I think I can afford a £1.50 hotwheels toy and should not have been treated and made to feel and look like a common crack head shoplifter.

I m from Oxfordshire and my local store is in Bicester! The past few weeks I ve been travelling to the store on a Sunday to purchase my favourite nuts (salt and black pepper cashews) so I can enjoy them while I watch the football but I ve been bitterly disappointed. Understandable because you guys are changing stores!  Anyway. Today  I ve finished work early (cheeky half day on a Friday) so I thought I d travel to my new local store that opened yesterday! I was excited to see what you guys had to offer! And what a superb job you guys have done. Pat yourselves on the back you deserve it!!  But  my trip to tesco today has turned into a tragic and distraught experience for me (and my girlfriend who I ve been venting my anger and disappointment to for the past half hour). I think by now you know what s coming...  So  I walk down the aisle where various crisps  nuts and other snacky items were. I find myself staring into what I can only describe as  nut hell  trying to locate the salt and black pepper cashews  that were the soul purpose of the trip. Nothing! Couldn t find them anywhere! Can you understand why I m so distraught?  Could you please shed some light on this please! I ve been forced to by normal salted cashews. It s not on tesco!

Left my bank card in tescos not even 24hrs ago & it s now been destroyed. Phoned them confirming it was there not long after I left  & told them I would be in first thing today before work for it they said thatl be fine  it will be there. It took 5 different people in total to help today  some telling me a load of rubbish about not been able to get it until later as it would set of an alarm. Half an hour later I get told it s at the police station  they keep some lost cards but not all. 30 minutes to check for a card! Went to the police station to find out it has been destroyed. Such a joke! Left with no bank card now because tesco seem like they don t have any proper processes in order for these kind of things. A simple message isn t even passed on to the store to ensure it is still there for me.

This was today in the Tesco Extra store in St Helens at 2.45pm.  It s not just the fact that it took her so long  it s the embarrassment to go with it and ends up making using the scan and shop completely pointless because I could have gone through a normal checkout in the time it took her to faff about.

I know you sell Swedish Glace dairy free ice cream but that s about all there is for us. Would be great to have a bit more choice.

Whilst shopping my nan slipped and fell on spilt bubble bath that was unfortunately not visible as it was white/almost clear that had not been cleaned up. She was in a lot of pain with her back and wrist so the following day she visited the local A&E to be told she has broken her wrist and had bad bruising on her back. After returning to the store to speak to a manager to let them know of the extent of her injuries she was told a manager would contact her. She has still heard nothing! I do not think this is acceptable! Surely the store should have logged this incident? My Nan is also a diabetic so has to be careful of painkillers she takes as they effect her blood sugar and tablets. So she has got to be in a lot of pain for the next 6/7 weeks with a cast on her right arm  which is the hand she writes with!;;;;;2016-04-15T10:22:14+0000;1460715734;2016-04-15 12:22:14;1;4;1;2;7;4;3;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

You also have an error in the information on the minimum weight for it to be used as a booster seat  legally this is 15kg not 13kg as you state. It is always safer to wait until the child is 18kg and exceeds the weight for the harness on these seats however.

Generally speaking your till colleagues are very polite and friendly. But this morning the lady that served me took extra time to help me fix my bag. I know that you have targets to hit for the amount of people and the pace at which people go through the tills. Please ensure this lady isn t penalised in anyway for stopping to help me. I didn t get her name but what probably felt like a small gesture to her fixing some thread on my bag has restored my faith in humanity. And as you have just reported a profit maybe you could give her a little bonus for outstanding customer service.;;;;;2016-04-15T07:58:13+0000;1460707093;2016-04-15 09:58:13;1;3;1;0;4;3;2;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I had my phone on me the whole day and received many calls from people prior to my delivery slot AND called you so the phone was working perfectly fine and I have good service in my house. A day later shopping still not here  no email  maybe even a text  all i get is sorry you ll get your refund. If the call wouldn t go through why not try texting or other ways to get in contact. I feel so irrelevant and unimportant. Now i know where not to order from.;;;;;2016-04-14T10:30:14+0000;1460629814;2016-04-14 12:30:14;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I went to your store in Woolwich on the way to visit my baby in hospital to buy the poorly naked baby some tiny clothes... your store sucked... badly... your sale Rail was like a boot sale. No tags items with things missing. But I needed the clothes so I choose some and took about 25 pounds worth to the till .. even willing to buy a set with bits missing cos I needed the tiny clothes... now not one person could help me when I tried to put things though the till. No one could leave anywhere no one know why you had a rail full of tagless items. I was spending longer and longer missing time with my baby while your unhelpfull stuff stood in their ordered areas and all told me they could not leave to help me. I wanted to buy these clothes I stood and my friend ran about trying to get some help. NOT ONE MEMBER of your staff knew what to do. In the end we had to leave the clothes at the till and just walk out as I was getting to the point where I wanted to shout about how crappy your customer service was and you clearly was not bothered about selling items so I left about 25 pounds worth of clothes and left with nothing. So my poor naked baby still has no tiny clothes your store still sucks and seeing it s one of the only places I can buy tiny clothes other then online it was extremely disappointing.  I would like someone to get in touch with me about how your having trouble selling items and which store would be best for me to walk into pick my clothes pay and walk out instead of waiting about for half an hour while your staff have a blank look on their face like they could not understand I was wanting to buy something... it made my day very annoying and my visit to my baby very sad as I wanted to dress her in outfits I had bought her... it may seem minor to you.

When she got to the checkout she was told by the snooty woman who was serving that technically she should charge my mum 10p for the bags!

You are concerned about maintaining comparability of senior staff remuneration with other similar companies  but if ALL companies put forward the same argument  then it maintains an artificially high level of expectation. Why not be bold and radical and set a lower rate of pay for senior staff  so you can pay a proper wage to the people who work for you on the less well paid levels.

My son had completely knocked himself unconscious  in my panic  of course my instinct was to lift him and cuddle him  he came round and was violently sick twice  while all the time the staff were amazing  and never once made me feel stressed or panic  there kindness and empathy  was exactly what I needed to keep myself calm and also him ... Of course ambulance was phoned and there within minutes  and again the lady seen to that  with minimal distraction  while I could attend to my quite poorly son  all in all  prob was only 15/20 from the time of the accident till we were blue lighted to the hospital  unfortunately with all the rush  of course  I never got the ladies names  but I can assure you I will find out and thank these ladies myself and go into the store  so again a massive thank you to your store and these fabby ladies 😘😘;;;;;2016-04-13T12:03:23+0000;1460549003;2016-04-13 14:03:23;1051;74;1065;56;1195;72;53;19;148;0;1038;11;3;0;0;0;0

I only realised this when I went to purchase my sons birthday present today for tomorrow. I rang my bank and they said the normal 98 has gone out and there s another 98 pending  which has sent me over drawn with no money in my bank account. So I rang head office and stupidly thought it would get sorted ASAP . I had an apology and was told I will have to wait 3/4 days to get the money back! I explained my bank had charged me 25 pound for something that wasn t my fault   and I now have no money for my sons birthday and all the lady said was she will give me a 5 pound good will voucher!!! Now I can t be the only one who thinks this is a absolute disgrace!!  It s bad enough I have to pay the overdraft but Who is going to explain this to a 4 year old with no birthday presents ?? I m truly shocked that such a big company can get away with treating people like this !!!!! No wonder they made such a good profit!!! Stealing people s money !!!! Like I said I use tesco every week for food and petrol  I am truly angry and upset with the whole experience !!!!!! I would appreciate some one getting in touch with me as 5 pound good will voucher is an absolute joke;;;;;2016-04-13T11:49:33+0000;1460548173;2016-04-13 13:49:33;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

You were very rude upon entering their home I witnessed as I was there with my partner and one year old daughter. It has since come to my attention that when you left you saw fit to take your concerns to the staff room where a friend of ours actually works as a delivery driver too (small world ey?). So let me clear up a few things for you...   The reason it says on our notes at home that we would like the shopping delivered to the kitchen and not the front door is because my Nana is disabled (not my Grandad who answered the door and had  nothing wrong with him ) although my Grandad did actually have a stroke the year before last. Which was actually a horrible experience  we nearly lost him and his left arm doesn t work anymore. He still gets our names confused sometimes and his memory isn t what it was. I digress  my Nana has a blue badge due to her countless illnesses  she has diabetes and nerve damage to her feet which leaves her in constant pain. She stays in bed most days and has to use a wheelchair when she does go out as she has crippling arthritis. This is the least of her worries really as the nerve damage in her back and neck has left her with two major surgeries  constant pain and damage to her voice box. So I m sorry you had to walk our shopping into the kitchen rather than the door  is that disabled enough for you?  My partner actually tried to help but when you barged through and nearly nocked over my Nana and daughter he thought it best to keep them out of the way. I don t know if you ve ever looked after a one year old but you are welcome to come and test it out of you think it constitutes as  sweet F A .   I hope this clears some issues up for you.

Luckily I didn t realise you could get one for me which was great . Unfortunately after you got me a trolley and the staff member disappeared   I realised for the second time visiting the harness strap was broken .The first time I thought ok maby it was just the one off so I just took the trolley to customer services   but today I was shocked to be given another one that was broken. I think this is a big health and safety issue.I then gave in after I couldn t find anyone and headed to the toy isle and let my daughter pick a peppa pig toy to keep her focused from jumping out as a times she starting to think she s Indiana Jones . My question to you is 1. Why don t you have a sign explaining that mothers and fathers can ask a member of staff for a trolley or go like morrisons and take away the pound for a trolley ?2.Do your staff not regularly check the safety of each trolley ?  Will look forward to your reply  Matt;;;;;2016-04-13T10:20:40+0000;1460542840;2016-04-13 12:20:40;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

When I arrived it was a frantic atmosphere  I was soon told by one of the assistants that yesterday their manager took ill and had to have his/her appendix removed  (I didn t catch if it was a man or woman)  so that explained the rush. The lady who arranged my appointment who was truly wonderful  a credit to your store  squashed me in that afternoon and took a pre test straight away so it was even quicker for me. When I returned the same lady greeted me  she talked me through the different frames you offer and again she was great. Then the optician called me through  from the moment I sat down he did not seem to have the time of day for me  I explained what I needed my glasses for and how I had been having migranes recently  but I furthur explained how I had been working a lot more and tried to make light of things with little jokes  which were not well recieved. During the appointment he was very rushed and seemed to be accusing me of faking eye-sight problems. He was changing lens  asking me if I could see a difference when I was answering honestlty he kept asking me if I was sure  and then the icing on his rude cake he said the line a health professional should never say   Are you sure  because we all love to say yes.  Overall he made me feel as though he did not have time for me  he did not want to help me  and he did not belive that I needed my glasses  (which I have been recieving on prescription from Tesco for 4 years). Sadly he was not wearing a name badge  lucky for him as I would most certainly name drop. I bought my glasses as I was in a rush  but I will not be visiting your opticians again.;;;;;2016-04-12T18:06:50+0000;1460484410;2016-04-12 20:06:50;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I stir my coffee for longer than I used to  to try to get them to dissolve  and still a semi-dissolved one pops up to the surface  so if I m not watchful I end up with a mouthful of very strong  semi-dissolved sweetener  and it s not very pleasant! I still have a few of the older ones in a travel dispenser  and they are fine  so it must be the new batch.;;;;;2016-04-12T13:37:12+0000;1460468232;2016-04-12 15:37:12;0;4;0;0;4;4;1;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The pain it would be awful  my diet choices changed  no ice creams  lollies or sorbets  it s a wonder I m not deranged. So I set myself a challenge  a cure I d surely find  must be a solution somewhere  that solution I would find. I travelled up and down the aisles of many a chemist shop  The well known brands were expensive  it would cost me lots of money to make to problem stop. Then one day whilst out shopping  I spied your very own brand. I picked it up and did a jig  the price it was not grand. I brought it home excitedly and put in on the shelf  to sort my teeth and be pain free would not affect my wealth. The weeks have passed  the pain has gone  I really do feel jolly  until this point I d never known how much a loved a lolly!

I decided rather than Take my two older children shopping in the day (as it s half term) I would just take our new nine week old baby girl instead  in the evening. So after lots of feeding and a clean nappy ...off we went.  However once in my local Chorley store my little bundle proceeded to cry the whole way around the shop  now with quite a list and two weeks of Half term this shop needed to be done. So I stopped in the stores feeding room and fed the baby. This pattern continued for 45 min with me getting quite flustered and trying to steer a heavy trolley and bounce an unsettled baby at the same time. Then Tesco your lovely staff came to my rescue....like a beacon of light in the dark they helped me with my shopping. First I had a lovely lady who whilst I went and fed the baby took my list and trolley and finished off most of my shopping. I then had two lovely ladies at the till who helped me pack and load my trolley and reassure me that all was ok. They didn t make me feel awkward  they just chatted calmly despite my crying infant and cooed over how lovely she was. This in turn made me relax slightly (despite the fact I was frazzled). And as I left another lovely lady came and offered to help me to the car. She then unloaded my bags into the boot and put away the trolley.  Tesco to you this may seem like those ladies where just doing their job. But tonight they all went above and beyond and showed so Much kindness. My little girl was born early and looks like a new born  I am  feeding her myself and despite all best plans tonight she just wanted me to feed her more. I was able to do this and finish my shopping thanks to the wonderful staff in this store. I am eternally grateful and really think they should be recognised for their good work and help. Tonight Tesco every little really did help and these ladies are superstars!! 😊;;;;;2016-04-11T21:56:24+0000;1460411784;2016-04-11 23:56:24;3711;114;3898;190;4202;113;97;16;209;0;3665;172;11;1;0;0;0

Edinburgh based. Very unhappy. So no confirmation the items made it back to store (as delivery driver had no reader with him and n paper for me to sign to say I received order)  and no confirmation at all the items would be refunded and apparently this is exactly how it should be because the manager of Corstorphne store Edinburgh says apparently and the young man in Tesco customer services that Tesco has no obligation to confirm the items were received back at store or that a refund would take place- the vegetables delivered  that were returned had gone slimy in the packet and were out of date the next day on a 10pm delivery.;;;;;2016-04-11T20:56:03+0000;1460408163;2016-04-11 22:56:03;0;4;0;0;4;4;3;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Gave her all to the job. Went on maternity leave last year. Decided in November to take a new job. Did not like new job so resigned and reapplied at a local store: Firstly she did not meet the criteria for the actual store....what on earth is that all about? (She knows every aspect of job) Secondly  she also applied for Tesco Petrol station adjacent to said store...this is where fun starts. Applied for job Friday and Saturday totally around 12 hours. Said she does not ever want to work more than 25 hours a week and no more than 4 days. Flexi contract right? Err no wrong!! Flexi contract for Tesco means: You are contracted for 2 days per week. You are available for 25 hrs/4days If we need you to work these 25 hours you must do it or you are breaking the terms of your contract...oh and by the way you will only ever accrue holiday for two days per week even if you work four days every week for a year??? This is not a flexi contract. Fkexi bends both ways. This is a zero hours contract with frills and forced overtime. Daughter was offered job then offer retracted because she MUST  be available for 25 hours EVERY WEEK AT 24 HOURS NOTICE?? Absolute joke!!!! You can never make plans book an appointment or go anywhere just in case we need you???;;;;;2016-04-11T17:59:07+0000;1460397547;2016-04-11 19:59:07;2;22;2;0;24;20;11;9;13;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

The last time I placed an order  the driver who called me for direction and I gave him directions to my door step decided in the lift not to deliver my groceries again  thinking I said there is no one at home. The reason I would have told him that while I am the one giving him directions just beats my thinking.  He was quick to log with his manager that I was not at home (what a lie!!). Then Tesco decided to charge my account more than the goods I bought (40p more) and decided not to refund the full amount.   Several complaints via chat and phone calls  no one has deemed it fit to respond to my previous complaints about the quality of their service (from start-finish)  as of today when I got on online chat  the CSO refunded my 40p and said my complaints are now noted.

Having looked on the Tesco Direct website this morning for a cordless power drill  I found one on offer with yourselves at the bargain price of £19. Great!  After using the *stock in your local store* button  I established there were stock available in your Stalybridge store. Great! So off I went to the Stalybridge store  searched high and low for said drill and couldn’t find it. I asked a member of staff who informed me that the Stalybridge store does not stock this item. Erm….what about available stock showing online? Not so great!  I decided to look for another store which had stock in by using the *stock in your local area* button  I noticed Oldham  Huddersfield Road had some showing in stock. So off we went  parked up and in I went. Yey I found the item I wanted on the shelf with about 10 others. Took it to the till to see £33 on the self serve screen…hmm I thought this item was £19? After asking a member of staff about the price difference I was told that this was an online offer not store offer and to speak to customer services. Nowhere online does it mention it is an online offer only and if this was the case  why have the option to search local stores for stock at this price??  I went to customer services and explained the price issue to the lady stood behind the counter. She said also it was an online offer and not available in store. So why was I allowed to search for local stores in the area that stocked this item??? At this price??? She explained I could buy it now with click and collect and come back tomorrow after 3pm to collect it  but would have to pay £2 extra…..what?? £2 for what exactly? So if I have to pay £2 extra  then the drill is not £19 as clearly stated online  but it is in fact £21! What is the difference between me picking the item up today and tomorrow? They were in stock! The woman on the customer service desk was less than helpful with such an attitude. I understand she can only give me information she has  but manners and compassion wouldn’t have hurt her! If that’s what she calls customer service  geez id hate to see what her bad customer service is like! I have never experienced customer service like this.  I am a loyal customer of Tescos and have been for many years  im going to reconsider this! Thanks for wasting my time today tescos!

Its a heartbreaking disease  and I m sure many of you have known or loved someone who has it. There are a lot of similarities between a small child and a dementia sufferer  my Nannys new little quirks brought on by her disease often make me smile and laugh  its become her. I need to tell you about yesterday and how i almost lost that smile.  I went to meet my Mum and Nanny in Tesco Yeovil for a coffee and a catch up. Now like many Dementia sufferers my Nanny has sought comfort in a Doll  a toy for many children  comfort for my Nanny. She likes to bring the doll with her everywhere. Something I m proud that my family has no issues or embarrassment doing. The doll gives her lots of joy and comfort  but not just for her  for myself and family also  since loosing her beloved Husband  its means she not alone when she goes to sleep or when she wakes up  she has something to look after  something to mother  someone else to love.  Now when i went to order my coffee in Tesco  I noticed a lady staring at my Nanny  now of course people will look  double take  its different  something most haven t seen before  most go on with there day & don t give it a second thought. This Woman continued to stare  she was with her teenager daughter who told her to stop looking. I waited for my coffee  and sat back down  she continued to turn around  her back was turned to us  so as you can imagine making it extremely obvious she was staring. She then began to laugh  her daughter nervously laughing with her  telling her to stop. Continuing to giggle and stare at my Nanny  at us.  At this point  my whole body was raging  my tummy doing flips  for anyone that knows me  I don t shy away from confrontation  i wanted to run over there and tell her exactly what i thought! I wanted to get my Nanny out of there and protect her. But instead i looked over at her and her doll  smiling  happy enjoying having coffee with her Daughter and Granddaughter  not a care in the world. She didn t notice the rude woman laughing at her  the anger in my face  the upset in my Mums. We did not say a word about the situation to each other  my Mum went for a cigarette and took a time out  i turned my back to the woman and we continued as if nothing had happened. As much as i wanted to run over and scream at her  for my Nanny sake we just laughed and smiled with each other.  So to the Woman who laughed  the woman who stared - I Thank you  because i now know i can deal with the situation i was always dreading  the way it should be dealt with.  I hope you can bring your daughter up a lot better than you were raised. Ive still got my smile.  I wanted to write this  just to raise a little awareness  I ve seen and heard of a lot of dementia suffers  taking comfort in dolls  teddies etc  Please don t be cruel  that could be your loved one  one day.;;;;;2016-04-11T15:25:34+0000;1460388334;2016-04-11 17:25:34;13;9;14;0;23;9;6;3;10;0;12;1;0;0;0;0;0

My aim is to spread awareness about an issue that has been around for decades.   My girlfriend works at the checkout at Sainsbury s  and has experienced this problem since she started working there a few years ago. The problem I am referring to is customers (particularly men aged 30+) approaching her outside of her working hours.   Of course  part of a shop assistant s job is to be kind to customers and make sure that they are fully satisfied  and so to do this they must smile and make small talk so that customers feel happy and comfortable. However  this behaviour  probably 90% of the time  is mistaken for  flirtation  and consent for the customer to approach the employee if they see them outside of the workplace.   Now I m not talking about a customer passing by an employee in the street just saying  hello!  and moving on. What I m talking about is customers physically stopping employees in the street by grabbing their arm  and then proceeding to talk with the employee for more than 10 minutes  and continuing to talk even after the employee has told them they need to leave. In a lot of cases  some of which I have experienced myself in a retail job  customers even ask employees for their phone number.  This is harassment. It may not be sexual or physical  but it is still harassment  and it s an issue that seriously needs to be dealt with. Of course the employee in these kinds of situations has no choice but to be kind and considerate to the customer as their jobs can potentially be at risk if they seem rude in any way  and so the answer could not simply be for the employee to dismiss the customer straight away or politely explain that they do not wish to talk to the customer outside of work. There is always a risk that the customer will react with aggression  or even complain about you to the company that you work for.   My girlfriend suffers from anxiety  but has overcome so much in the past few years. Now she has told me recently that she worries on her walk to work every day that she will bump into a customer and have to put up with this harassment again and again.   Something needs to be done. I don t know what  but this is a problem for customers in workplaces all around the globe. I hope I can at least raise more awareness with this message  and I hope that customers read this and think again about approaching employees outside of their workplace.;;;;;2016-04-11T13:05:24+0000;1460379924;2016-04-11 15:05:24;2;5;2;0;7;5;1;4;2;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Anyway I ordered on Friday morning for my shopping to be delivered Saturday.  It didn t turn up  I contacted the grocery department to which they told me it had gone to my old address. The lady didn t really care that my family s £80 food shop had gone somewhere else. The best she could offer was a 3-5 day refund. She did however tell me to re order. So £160 out of pocket for a fault with either yourselves or the app. I will not be using tesco online again I will be going else where.

I just wanted to ask why your cafe has such a poor selection of dairy free foods? Your stores have wonderful free from sections and we often shop there. However today we decided to have a little nibble whilst there. We visited your large store in Bedford. The staff were pretty helpful and provided the allergy chart however the only dairy free child option they had was not available  she wanted a pack lunch bag like her older sister but all the sandwiches and most of the selections such as cheese and yogurts are not suitable. We asked for some scramble egg on toast but your scramble egg comes in large containers and contains milk. We went through the menu and any non dairy options which were very limited were all high in fat and salt which are very unsuitable for a dairy free child. Could you please make a dairy free sandwich or something so that our little ones can have a pack lunch bag. You are missing out on a very large market. I shall be posting my complaint on several allergy sites as I feel others would feel the same. Many thanks naomi;;;;;2016-04-10T18:49:30+0000;1460314170;2016-04-10 20:49:30;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

We have just had our new insurance come through from TESCO INSURANCE for our Erin our Doberman who  Will be eight ht in October. Last year it went up to  70 pounds a month. We paid it because she had a operation during the year and was still on medication. This year they have put it up to 134.71 pounds a month. HELP  we are disgusted.

My wife and I have been in hospital with my daughter who is unwell. When I left the hospital last night to get some dinner for us both and to pick up some coke my wife called to say that she needs some headphones as the TV sound goes off at 21:00 and she wanted to be able to listen to what she was watching. I went into the store and asked one of your managers who s name was Ben ( I think he is the online manager) where the headphones were in the store. He took me to them and on the way we were talking and I explained about being in hospital with my daughter and what had happened with the TV. He said that I can t imagine what you are going through and the least you want to be worrying about is headphones please have them on us. I was so taken back that Ben had obviously seen I was a little tired and emotional and offered this very kind gesture. It felt like he had given me a million pounds. This goes to show that there are some very kind people out there and I am still overwhelmed with Bens very kind gesture. Please can I ask that this gets shown to the most senior person possible so that Ben gets the most amount of credit as possible. Thank you Tesco for employing people like Ben.;;;;;2016-04-10T11:42:48+0000;1460288568;2016-04-10 13:42:48;26;2;26;0;28;2;2;0;0;0;26;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ordered £225 shopping from Tesco s On line but they cancelled my order and did not tell me this was due for delivery at 12-1 yesterday. after 3 phones and a promise of sorting it out no one has called me back still no shopping and a ruined wasted weekend. I have shopped with Tesco s for 15 years and my shopping has been delayed 3-5 hours on at least 8 times and finally cancelled for been high risk. which is an insult as I put matches on the order which is freely available on the website. I emailed the chairman but got no  response and now I am left with still no shopping and a wasted weekend which since I work is precious.

Visited your Great Notley store in Braintree late at 11:35 25 minutes before closing as my girlfriend works late and this was the only chance we had to go  just needed a few bits so wouldn t take long.  We proceeded told by several members of staff that the store was due to close shortly which was fine as we expected this. Everything went well until we got to the checkout just after 11.50 with what we thought would be more than enough time to scan our items.  As we were walking to the checkout with a small basket of items the security guard waiting at the self checkout shouted out  doubt you ll be getting that through before we close  which we ignored as we could not tell whether he was joking or not. The customer service assistant at the self checkout sighed as we walked up and then proceeded to almost steal our basket away and rushed our items through the self checkout and then put them on the floor and told us to pack them! In the mean time the security guard was making comments in the back ground that were in no way subtle   for god sake  didn t you know the store closes at 12  this isn t 24 hours today you know  why do customers do this  next time come earlier   this was all right behind us and the assistant at the checkout was just agreeing with the security guard whilst packing our shopping leaving my girlfriend and myself standing there just shocked! The assistant then proceeded to give us instructions to pack our shopping immediately as the store was about to close which we were well aware of then telling my girlfriend to pay quickly  to get her change and receipt before nearly had to hand it to her himself. The security guard behind us was telling customers coming through the door that the store was closed  even though this was before 12 and the doors were still open. One customer got sent out even though she just wanted some bread and milk. If a store is advertised as closing at 12 then why are your employees turning business away if it s not yet closing time? Surely that cannot be commercial? I told both employees that you shouldn t treat customers this way and it is in no way acceptable to do so which they did not reply to. Finally we were escorted to the door quickly which was fine as we couldn t wait to leave at this point. As we left one of your employees who opened the door for us apologised for the service and said I hope you do come back to us and I thanked him for noticing as my girlfriend made them aware next time we wouldn t return.  I cannot understand how you can let your staff act this way and treat customers so badly considering its customers like myself who actually keep your business running. I have always worked with the public and would never treat a customer in this way. What your employees say behind closed doors is one thing but saying it in front of a customer is just plain rude  especially as we do our weekly shopping there.;;;;;2016-04-09T23:46:19+0000;1460245579;2016-04-10 01:46:19;0;41;1;1;43;40;21;19;30;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

Having tried big name brands previously  as well as competitor supermarkets  your nappies are by far the best I have found and have been a saving grace for a mother surrounded by poo (albeit contained) in her hour of need. We have also noticed the new and improved elastic sides and tabs which have massively reduced accidents and therefore save me hours of floor cleaning and baby clothes soaking. Thank you very much Tesco.;;;;;2016-04-09T19:57:06+0000;1460231826;2016-04-09 21:57:06;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I visited your winsford  Cheshire store earlier this evening and just wanted to thank you the two men who helped me with my shopping. I am 7 months pregnant and went in for a few bits. The man behind the counter took my basket off me  packed my bag and then his assistant helped me carry my groceries to my car. Thanks fellas.

The reduction in size is ridiculous  even the lady serving had a  hand to forehead  moment when I questioned it and commented that people had been pulling her up on it all day.  My question is how can you get away with this? I certainly didn t fall for such a blatant scam but wonder where else in the store you do this?  Shame on you Tesco...... 😡;;;;;2016-04-09T19:08:37+0000;1460228917;2016-04-09 21:08:37;3;7;3;0;10;7;2;5;2;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

My friend purchased three Ginsters Chicken & Bacon Pasties  shelf edge lable said £1.00 each. The till said £1.60  we know this is the correct price  BUT legally if the shop misprice a product  they are required by the Sale of Goods Act  to complete the sale @ the indicated price.  Demanding the extra £1.80 is totally illegal  and I and my friend feel so agreved that we posted this facebook post and will not be visiting the store again any time soon.  PS we have previously been good customers of the store!  Sending a member of staff to remove the shelf edge lable rather than owning up to a mistake is a despicable way of behaving!;;;;;2016-04-09T18:47:01+0000;1460227621;2016-04-09 20:47:01;0;10;0;0;10;7;7;0;16;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Cat food (whiskers multi pack) didn t have only Felix 12 pouches! 4. Chicken casserole mix....didn t have only chilli con carne! Had to go tesco extra....out of my way. BUT what I did notice only on meringues as couldn t be bothered checking others. Your  finest   meringue nest were £1.59 or 2 for 2.50?????

Whilst I was impressed by the service I was offered by the mobile phone sale s man  the lady at the money exchange and the car valet service  I m afraid I cannot say the same for my experience in the café. At first all was well. My children enjoyed a sausage and chip lunch whilst I enjoyed a hot coffee. When my elder son  Oscar  finished  he asked if he could have one of the yummy chocolate muffins he had spotted whilst ordering lunch. Now  my younger son had not quite finished so I took this opportunity to give Oscar a bit of  independence  and a little life learning experience. I handed him a £5 note  and said to him   make sure you join the back of the queue  be patient  be poliet . I could see the glee in his face that I  for the first time trusted him to venture a little further by himself and take this step. When he walked nicely over to the counter I positioned myself so I could see both my younger son finishing his lunch  and Oscar  queueing for his muffin. What I saw next I watched in disbelief  and my heart sank. Not one person acknowledged my son who  after waiting patiently was now at the front of the line. Instead I watch customer after customer being served instead. His little smile  turned into frustration  yet he still stood waiting patiently. I walked over  helped him pick his muffin and we went to the till together. It was only then he was acknowledged.  I m writing this because if it had been an adult in that situation it would not be stood for. I am raising my son s to treat ALL people with respect  have manners and patients. Something I feel he demonstrated a lot more than your staff and customers today. Please make your staff aware they should acknowledge EVERYBODY. What if my son was a little boy lost and wanting someone to help him? No one even bothered to ask. As for my son  I m proud that he remained patient and polite. Something I struggled to do after witnessing his puzzled little face as to why no one was looking at him.  As for his little life lesson  not all people are raised with manners.;;;;;2016-04-09T15:55:50+0000;1460217350;2016-04-09 17:55:50;13;14;13;2;29;14;8;6;15;0;13;0;0;0;0;0;0

A little annoyed I kept it to myself and stewed about it. More annoyed at myself for being a wimp and not asking him why he didn t just move them or even wait and I would have!!   Then tesco  you wonderful people  send me a text asking me about the service today. Normally it s 2 or 3 texts asking me on a scale how happy was I.  For the first time ever I gave you bottom marks. I know I felt bad but I was hoping to get my pent up annoyance but then you simply reply. oh sorry. . . well not quite but no asking why. . or how. . nothing.

I have been to Spring Hill Tesco in Birmingham this morning to do a big shop and the trolley that I had would not go in a straight line.  Now this usually would not be an issue for me as generally I would have my husband with me  however this morning he was sleeping.  I don t think it is fair to wake my husband up on a Saturday morning to come and push my wonky trolley in Tesco.  I had to struggle the whole way round bashing into people.  Please get the tracking sorted on your trolleys  there is a place that we take our car too and I am sure they would offer a discount for you on a job lot of trolleys.

Today I have sold my car and called up to cancel my insurance. I have paid £77 per month with you since I have had the policy. I am disgusted that you are charging £40 to cancel this policy. All you have to do is send a letter (with a stamp) and cancel on your computer screens. I would like to know exactly what I get for the £40 other than my pants pulled down.   I can assure you never again will I take out Tesco car insurance. I m sure Tesco make millions of pounds a year in profits and still feel it s acceptable to charge £40 to cancel.   I think I might have to reconsider spending a penny with the Tesco brand in the future.;;;;;2016-04-09T08:50:53+0000;1460191853;2016-04-09 10:50:53;7;20;7;0;27;19;15;4;37;0;7;0;0;0;0;0;0

What can I say.... NEVER AGAIN!!! I usually shop for 2-3 weeks in advance of my delivery date. Five days before my delivery date  I encountered a problem with the search engine (*1* result when I searched for jam!). I reported it  but didn t get a reply from Asda until the day after my delivery. One of their substitutions made no sense - I wanted a jar of tahini and was sent a smoked BBQ rub instead. One of their substitutions was sending me 140g of cashews instead of the 200g I ordered - and still charging me the 200g price! I ordered some organic lemons - thery arrived in a pack with a  best before  date of 9th april. Went to use them on the 8th to find two of them totally mouldy. By now I was totally disillusioned  but the icing on the cake was when I decided to check the expiry dates on the rest of my stuff  only to discover that almost everything fresh was ridiculously short-dated. For example brand products which I have bought from other retailers with around 3 weeks in which to use them - and from Asda  with only around 3-5 days! This has made me believe that Asda must be instructing their employees to pick the shortest-dated stuff for their online customers. I complained  of course  and I got a phone call from a very pleasant customer services lady who sorted out refunds for me - but that s not the point. I don t want to be wasting my time in having to check things and complaining. Which is why I shan t be shopping online ith ASDA again. It s back to Tesco for me!;;;;;2016-04-09T08:07:37+0000;1460189257;2016-04-09 10:07:37;1;4;1;0;5;4;2;2;9;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I felt I should write to you to explain how my world came crashing down around me  whilst ordering our groceries using your obviously incredible online shopping website thing this afternoon. Grab a tissue  this is an emotional one.  The wife and I have been using your home delivery service for proper ages now  as basically we re too lazy to physically go to the shops  and have never had a problem since. Not even when our ordered meat for a small Sunday roast was substituted with a £12 lamb joint the size of New Zealand. We re committed you see  and normally obstacles that we face on the road to stuffing our fridge  freezer  cupboard or face are instantly dismissed and laughed at heartily  especially where Tesco is concerned.  I openly admit that I wrote to you before regarding the stiff caps on your children s yoghurt pouches  (the ones that gave our daughter forearms like Popeye)  but I swept all that under the carpet. All forgotten.  Now  over the past few months I made a tidy discovery in your store. A legend of the freezer department. A revolution in baked curry dishes. A prime piece of pastry perfection. Yep  that s right  I m talking about your awesome Tesco Chicken Madras Bakes. These awesome treats are not only an example of Michelin star food production  but they also come at the bargain price of 99 english pence per 2 bake box. An absolute bargain. Not sure exactly how you re making profit on them  but who am I to complain.   Up until last weekend I had successfully smashed just over 4 000 individual bakes down my neck  and given their high nutritional value  I ve gained around 3 stone in lean muscle thanks to the raw protein intake supplied by the chunks of quality chicken these bakes provide. I owe you a few knuckle taps for that. I have eaten them all day  every day  at home  work and in bed.  Anyway  earlier today I was browsing said amazing grocery site  excited to order my favourite baked Indian cuisine  but to my horror  it said that you don t sell them anymore.   I know  mental isn t it.   At first I thought this could be some kind of belated April Fool s joke  but I soon realised that s not your style. You re no fools  but then again  you would be to give up on such an amazing invention. If you ve tried them yourself then you re probably as shocked as me. If you haven t  then I really do feel for you.  My freezer  my balanced diet  my mood  my marriage  my job  and my ability to purchase the finest in Madras-based pastry products are all affected by your decision to cull my beloved Chicken Madras Bakes  and I was wondering  aside from explaining the real reason for the axe  if there is anything you can do for me as compensation for such heartache  as I find this situation more upsetting than the end of Marley & Me.  Thanks in advance  and indeed for the now sadly unavailable Tesco Chicken Madras Bakes.  Much love and all that jazz  Dave;;;;;2016-04-08T20:37:31+0000;1460147851;2016-04-08 22:37:31;59;10;73;21;104;10;10;0;43;0;59;1;0;12;0;0;0

What amazing customer experience I ve just had at Bradley Stoke Superstore (store no. 5652).  My dad had sadly passed away and had 6 unopened spindles of blank Tesco branded DVDs. I didn t have any receipts or proof of purchase  so I thought I d popped into this store and explained the situation.   Mohammed Qureshi was very understanding and wanted to be able to help. He did have to check and he spoke to his manager Paul Waspe who agreed not only for me to be allowed to bring the DVDs back  but for me to be given a full refund!!   I was so taken aback by this amazing offer after leaving the customer service desk....I cried. I was quite emotional anyway as these discs were bought by my dad and I had kind of expected it to be a  no !  This is what you call Customer Service. A BIG thank you to Mohammed and Paul for not  following the usual rules for refunds  and  putting the customer first .;;;;;2016-04-08T19:26:06+0000;1460143566;2016-04-08 21:26:06;27;4;29;0;33;4;2;2;3;0;27;1;1;0;0;0;0

It just seems odd to me that almost everyone I know used to rave about your nappies  myself included. But these new ones are just terrible! I wonder if whoever is behind this change  actually even uses these nappies. Why fix something that isn t broken?!;;;;;2016-04-08T09:57:59+0000;1460109479;2016-04-08 11:57:59;3;11;3;0;14;11;10;1;7;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

Although the fence has now been fixed it has taken 2 months for that to happen and the the people doing the work cancelled twice and did not turn up once. Meaning I had to stay in and wait for them for no reason.  The accident happened in the evening whilst I was desperately trying to get my 2 month year old son to sleep  it made an almighty bang and woke him up  I then had the delivery driver (a stranger) in my house for 2 hours trying to sort out the incident.  Therefore I could not get my son back to sleep.  I am a new single mum and had the security of my property compromised for 2 months and not to mention that evening as well.  And to add insult to injury when I have tried to order my shopping online with you it says my address is not recognised  so how did someone down my road get theirs delivered???? I am still waiting on as much as an apology from Tesco.  Very disappointed;;;;;2016-04-08T09:10:48+0000;1460106648;2016-04-08 11:10:48;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

In actual fact I even had ten branded items. When it came to the checkout needless to say no money was knocked off. So I was scammed into buying more to make sure I qualified and then diddled out the difference between what the cheaper shops charge. And on the same note your fuel prices which once were competitive with asda are now always a penny dearer. No loyalty to your customers. Will be staying loyal to Asda in future.

By 8.30pm it hadn t arrived so I called customer services. A very helpful lady looked into the issue and said the delivery driver had tried and failed to deliver at 7.03pm  and had left a card. I can assure you both my husband and I were in at that time and in fact  I had been in the house all day. The doorbell works and there is a door that can be knocked on too. No card was left nor was any delivery attempted at my house. The customer services lady then contacted the delivery driver on our behalf who said he d try again at the end of his other deliveries and that she d call back at 9.30pm to see if we had received our groceries. At 9.30pm I got my call  from a man at the depot this time  who said they were organising another driver to meet the original one  collect our order and deliver it to us. Great  we thought  only two hours late but at least it s on its way. 10.10pm and we were still waiting for our order so I called the man back to see how things were going. This time I was told they can t deliver and will bring it tomorrow instead.  It is way past my bedtime  Tesco  and I wish this had been the solution originally rather than making me wait up all this time. Would I still be waiting now  had I not made that phone call? Now I sincerely hope  Tesco  that 1) I will not incur another delivery charge  since I understand that is the practice if the customer misses their original delivery slot  as I was actually at home at 7.03pm and 2) my delivery does indeed arrive tomorrow.  Yours faithfully  a tired customer.;;;;;2016-04-07T21:22:18+0000;1460064138;2016-04-07 23:22:18;0;6;0;0;6;6;4;2;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Can you please tell me if you ve changed the recipe of your own-brand cat food? I ve always bought the Tesco Cuts Mixed Selection for my three. I noticed it was temporarily unavailable for a while last month  and when it reappeared on the shelves there had been a revamp and the box had changed shape. Have the ingredients also changed? None of my cats will eat it now. Really disappointed as it was great value and they loved it before.

I ordered something online for my sons birthday because  it was guaranteed to be there  in time however if was not delivered until 4 days after.  If I had known that it would not be delivered on time I would have ordered from elsewhere. I am thoroughly disappointed as this is not the first time. What makes it more annoying and heartbreaking is letting my 9 year old son down on his birthday. As way of goodwill I was offered £20  which I just don t think is good enough. As your staff member from customer care team told me she believed £20 was adequate compensation. Let me ask you. Would you be happy with this service? Because I can assure you £20 doesn t even come close to making up for the upset caused by Tesco to my son on his birthday. I look forward to your response.

I attended your Pontardawe store around lunch time on Thursday 31st March and would like to say thank you for the great customer service I received. This what happened:- It was my daughter s 5th birthday in 2 days so I had to go shopping for food for her birthday party and had to take my 2 children with me (age 2 and 4 at the time). Shopping with children can be stressful at the best of times  let alone when you have something important like a party to plan for. I had already been to 2 shops previously to visiting your Pontardawe store and had been out of the house with my children for 3 hours already so by this point I was slowly losing my patience and they were understandably bored. My son had started to throw a temper tantrum in the trolley and was screaming  I had a few looks off people judging me  who obviously didn t know the whole story. This wasn t what Peter did instead he asked my son what was the matter. And although my son didn t answer  he immediately stopped crying  which broke the tension. Peter was very friendly and carried on interacting with both of my children and by the time we walked away my children were much happier. At the time I didn t thank Peter as I was very stressed and in my own little world. I then proceeded to the self service checkout while I was scanning my items Gerry was talking to my children and kept them amused while I finished scanning my items. This is when I realised I should have thanked Peter for his earlier intervention. By the time I left your store I was much less stressed and my children were in a better mood too  which is very unusual for a shopping trip with children. People are very quick to complain (myself included) but forget to say thank you for good service. Peter and Gerry provided exceptional customer service and what may not have seemed like a big deal to them made a huge difference to my day!;;;;;2016-04-07T10:05:17+0000;1460023517;2016-04-07 12:05:17;15;3;15;0;18;3;1;2;0;0;14;0;0;0;0;0;0

We were asked to take photos of the  blurr   which we did and to send them to an email address given to us over the phone. We heard nothing from you  so we rang again. We were then told they had not received any photos. This was possibility because we had sent too many photos  so could we send just two! This we did. Since then we have emailed to ask what is happening as its been along time since we contacted you. And guess what no reply still. The TV was bought in October so it s still under guarantee.

He is an utter embarrassment to your company   and unless I get an appropriate response from you   I may be forced to go and deal with this myself! STEVEN his name is. Extremely gaunt   unhealthy looking  man . My Son was in the store with his Girlfriend and his Mum. He picked up an item and made a joke to his Mum about it   no more   no less. With that   Steven very rudely tells my Son that if he continues to  muck about  he should leave the store. Hearing this my Wife confronted him   to ask what on earth was he doing talking to our Son like this?  his response was sarcastic  rude and offensive   patronisingly calling her  love  and acting as if he had done nothing wrong. I appreciate you may get some toe rags in the shop at times   especially in the school holidays. But to embarrass my Son and patronise my Wife   just for having a laugh with each other is frankly disgusting customer service and he is extremely lucky I haven t stormed straight back down there to advise him on his obvious lack of customer service skills. He is a total embarrassment to your company  and makes a mockery of your selection process.  Please advise me on what to do next with this complaint   because believe me   I won t let anyone else put up with this kind of embarrassment in your store.  Awaiting your prompt response.

I wanted to buy a drink yesterday and I was not allowed to because the assistant considered that I look under 25 and I had to show my ID card. When I did so  she told me that it is not accepted and I had to carry my passport in order to get a bottle of wine!  First and foremost  I have a Tesco club card which confirms my age (24). Secondly  I use my ID card to travel all over the EU  I am a EU citizen and according to the EU legislation I can do so ( Regulation EC No 562/2006). Thirdly  I showed all my student cards (I am a PhD student  which I think proves I am over 18) and my bank cards  via which I order online every time  including alcohol. I think that it is vey unfair that I can order online without showing any passport documents but on the other hand I cannot buy a product on my own in a supermarket. Finally  I also had my EU health card  which has my date of birth on it  as all the previous documents. As you can imagine I was really upset and this is so subjective  as I am living in Ireland for 14 months and never had I such an issue on buying products  including Tesco.   I am really disappointed on this behaviour  which is unjustified. I also complained in the customer service but the problem was not solved. I do not really know what is the solution  but I would really appreciate it if I did not have to argue in the supermarket everytime I need to get a product.  I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter as soon as possible.  Kind regards;;;;;2016-04-06T09:27:59+0000;1459934879;2016-04-06 11:27:59;1;11;1;0;12;10;2;8;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Sent a complaint at the beginning of March regarding a Hudl. They agreed to refund £30. Completed a BACS form on the 7th March  chased it up on the 17th March to be told that I had missed a digit and to phone. I phoned and got a very rude man who told me that he couldn t take any bank details over the phone and I had to fill in another form  which I did. The error I had made the first time was actually due to the form not allowing 0 to be the first digit  so I wrote this on my email. Was told in an automated reply that it would take 10 working days. Nothing happened so I sent an email  no reply. Asked through private message on here  and was told you had checked and it was going to be 14 working days which was today. Nothing in my account so I sent another message only to be told you have no record of my form being returned  despite being told last week that my 14 days was up on the 6th.

When I passed the bakery aisle  a member of staff was loading a large amount of baguettes (and presumably then other baked goods) into red bin bags labelled  not fit for human consumption . Given the amount there (already almost filled a 2nd bag and still a lot of bread on the shelves) i wondered if this  waste  actually just goes straight into a bin? Given that I m sure it can t have been on sale for longer than a day or 2  I hardly imagine it s  not fit for human consumption  (I certainly keep freshly baked bread for a few days and it s still perfectly edible) the level of waste this must create concerns me given that there are so many people homeless and/or hungry who would benefit from these items. To see this and then see a collection box for food bank donations near the tills at the store seems to me a complete contradiction?! Also I can t imagine I d be best impressed had I been about to buy a baguette to see that my full priced baguettes neighbour was being labelled not fit for human consumption 😂;;;;;2016-04-05T20:35:17+0000;1459888517;2016-04-05 22:35:17;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

However  we went to Launceston branch today and popped in for a coffee at the Costa outlet while we waited for our tyres to be changed just across the road. We paid & collected our hot chocolate and cake and went to find a vacant table. There were lots of vacant tables but every one of them had uncollected dirty dishes on! The manager was more concerned with people waiting for food  so we cleared our own table and added our tray to the pile on the cill by the window! The whole time we were there  he flitted about like a demented thing and only when we were ready to leave did someone come out and start clearing the tables. As a management consultant and past owner of my own tea shop  I was appalled that someone who is supposed to be a manager  had no idea how to prioritise his work to ensure not only the tables were cleared  but the food was also served. I suggest you speak to the francise company and get them to sort it. It does Tesco no favours to have dirty and scruffy tables on show from the front door and those walking through to the loos.;;;;;2016-04-05T18:04:14+0000;1459879454;2016-04-05 20:04:14;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

It was hard enough to get in contact with Hotpoint as they don t answer their phone lines. Needless to say  Hotpoint failed to get in contact with me to arrange the engineer. As my dryer was purchased from Tesco Direct  I also contacted them to express my concerns about the dangerous dryer over 6 weeks ago. I was informed that I would be passed to a customer service agent who would be in contact with me within 24 hours. This never happened.

I rushed in to get some Calpol and he was so upset and couldn t walk far as his tummy was very painful.  The lady that worked in there  (early 20 s brown hair) sorry I didn t catch her name   came and spoke to him to see how he was and got him a chair to sit on whilst I paid etc. She was so kind to him and really cared.  She even told me about local hospitals etc as I didn t know where they were.  Thankfully he recovered and was just too many sweets.  I will never forget what she did.  She didn t have to do anything but she did anyway.  Please let her know that I am so grateful to her.

I called customer services first thing this morning who said they would get my local store manager to call me and see if they could arrange a delivery of missing items for this evening. It s now 2:45pm and still no call. I then used the online chat facility to see if there was an update  only to be told that they were sure the store manager had it in hand and would call me. I explained that I need to know whether I need to replace the items on my way home so that I can cook dinner but this didn t help.

I phoned this morning to complain about your Tesco Ultra Dry nappies today and spoke to a lovely girl called  I think  Chantelle.  It is obvious this nappies have changed as they are now thinner and the material is  crispier . The extra stretch on the waist tabs is a good idea but as soon as the nappy gets wet they sag like mad and droop!! The wet area is not evenly spread and hangs between the legs.  However my complaint was about the crystals in the nappy. When my daughter woke from her sleep this morning I changed the nappy she had been in all night and was disgusted to find her bottom was covered in the gel crystals from the nappy!!   I spoke to Chantelle  who was very helpful  and she advised me to take the used nappy  packaging and any unused nappies back to the shop to complete a complaint form. However when I said they were part of my home delivery she had to put me through to the home delivery team.  However Maurice who I then spoke to just wanted to refund me the price of the nappies and couldn t get off the phone quick enough!! I asked him if it would be looked into and he said a message would be sent to the Beverley store where they came from. No bar code or reference number was taken! How can the manufacturer follow up a complaint without these details?  Reading through the comments on this page I see that this is not a one off faulty pack but that the nappies in general are now being made to a lower standard than before! I have always bought your nappies over the Pampers that I have used for my older children as they were genuinely better nappies but I will not be buying them anymore!  I look forward to hearing your comments;;;;;2016-04-04T13:12:41+0000;1459775561;2016-04-04 15:12:41;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

But these new ones don t even last 2 hours! They bulge and fill so much. The worst of it though the gel beads from the inside have leaked at every nappy he has worn!!

I searched on Google and seen that someone else had contacted you so I decided to do the same.   I recently purchased a bottle of Smirnoff vodka in Ballina as I passing through on my way south. I was surprised to find  that the Vodka today is frozen solid  this has happened with a bottle I brought from Aldi Sligo and just thought perhaps Aldi had received a dodgy batch as they were selling it at a marked down price. I am now concerned that perhaps Tesco may also be receiving dodgy alcohol as I have never had Vodka freeze.   I will have to look to see if I still have the receipt for the proof of purchase but needless to say I am not very happy at all and especially when I chose to pay extra for the Smirnoff brand and not buy a other brand or a cheaper Vodka.   I will also be contacting Smirnoff as it seems to be a issue with there product too.;;;;;2016-04-03T18:23:15+0000;1459707795;2016-04-03 20:23:15;0;4;0;0;4;4;3;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Over the millennia that humans have inhabited this planet they have manufactured and used tools which help to make various task easier to achieve; be it a tool or weapon to catch prey for food  a specific brush for an artist to produce a beautiful masterpiece or an online social media outlet to allow quick and easy interaction with a company s customers.   as humanity has evolved and progressed through the ages so have the tools we as a species use to make our lives easier  and that is what brings me to my message of great importance:  PLEASE can you change the fork you include with your pasta dishes (the ones which are included in your meal deals) to something a bit more sturdy? the poorly made utensil which is included with the food is flimsy and frankly difficult to try and eat with. the terrible hinged joint in the middle used to make the handle of the fork longer is incredibly weak and food has been spilt because of it. at times i have even considered using a pair of matchsticks and some tape to form a splint to hold the joint together because of the problems i have had with the folding fork included with the meal. this is 2016. disposable forks should not be as terrible as the ones you include in your pasta meals.  a shorter  sturdier handled fork would be much more convenient to use  even for someone with large hands such as myself. you could take a leaf out of the co-operative s book and use the humble Spork. it is a delightful tool created for easy  on-the-go consumption of meals which need a utensil which has both the prongs to hold food safely and the capacity to keep a decent amount of the meal in place as it travels from bowl/plate to mouth.   top much of your delicious pasta has been spilt down the front of people s clothes because the utensil you have provided has been inefficient at keeping food in place between plate and mouth.  i implore you  PLEASE make a change. let no more pasta be spilt because of this minor  yet horrible problem.  sincerely  Joshua Hammond.";;;;;2016-04-03T15:00:30+0000;1459695630;2016-04-03 17:00:30;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have been online shopping for the last 8 years and ive got to say that Tescos is slowly going down the pan. The last 3 weeks I have had too many fresh items with short dates on ( I mean to be consumed the day after ive bought them!!)  Many things on the website not being sold by Tesco any more (not specialist items either  everyday items )  Then you have changed suppliers for a lot of your veg and fresh meats and ive got to say they are substandard to what you stocked before. Now i appreciate you have to look for cheaper alternatives and money making is your game but the customer helps you by buying your stuff !!   Plus your prices are rising every week too. Im sorry but as a reverent Tesco customer it grieves me to have to even think about going elsewhere but im sorry I will be going elsewhere from next week. I have the choice of ASDA  SAinsbury for delivery  Morrisons I can get taxis and still save with the taxi fare include  Iceland  Aldi and Lidl. Being disabled and having mobility issues the home delivery from Tescos was why I chose you in the first place 8 years ago  but Im sorry the way your not putting your customers needs first anymore is why Im going else where. You must realise people shop for the week at least when they order online not daily so the short dates on fresh items should reflect the needs of online grocery shoppers surely as intelligent people you should see that. Put the short dates on shelves in stores  make online shoppers have at least 5 days on their stuff the amount of stuff going in my bin as well is shameful. Sorry Tesco you have let me down again.;;;;;2016-04-02T19:25:32+0000;1459625132;2016-04-02 21:25:32;1;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Just returned from tesco in Drogheda today.  I purchased my groceries and my 25year old son was next with some alcohol.  He was asked for ID but had none.  I am all for policies if there executed properly and in line with other policies.  The cashier tried to explain the policy and I argued with her. The supervisor was called and her explanation wasn t much more helpful.  They couldn t sell the alcohl to me because they said i was buying it for him.  This is ridiculous.    1.  No signage at the alcohol counter about company policy.  2. Would I have have been so stupid as to let this happen had i known the policies. NO.  I just would ve told my son I would get the alcohol for him and sent him outside to wait.  He is 25 after all  3. You can purchase alcohol online and have it delivered to the home of a person who has  teenagers living with them. Does this mean you shouldn t sell alcohol on line? 4. Are we communists now  being dictated to and  we re not allowed to think for ourselves.    Anyway my son did get his alcohol. I had to leave the original alcohol at the cashiers and I simply went and picked up the same items again and went to an other cashier.  Tesco   I have read umteen complaints about this issue.  Will you please do something about it.  Good customer service goes a long way.;;;;;2016-04-02T14:46:29+0000;1459608389;2016-04-02 16:46:29;1;45;1;1;47;43;21;22;140;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I brought 3 bags of size 4+ nappies from you last week like I do every month for my 2 daughter.  But this new bag is rubbish!! My daughters (10month  23 months) has been leaking out their nappies  even after me changing their bums 30mins before! They are not soaking up her wee as good as they used to  Also I noticed that when cleaning cleaning her bum  I see the crystals from the nappy which has never happened before.   I noticed with this bag I opened the waist band bit had changed but makes me wonder if anything else has changed??   I shop with you every week for my weekly shop and buy my daughter nappies from your every 3 weeks!! I am really considering going back to aldis nappies but this really doesn t help me as I don t shop in aldis which is why I swapped to tescos!

I placed an online grocery order  scheduled for home delivery between 10pm-11pm this evening. It is now 11:30pm and my delivery has not arrived. I have heard nothing from the delivery driver  and all of your customer contact telephone lines closed at 11pm. There is nobody within your company with whom I can speak to tonight to determine whether my order is  merely  late or whether it will even be delivered at all. I have checked on my online account and am unable to track the progress of my order- because my delivery timeslot has passed  it is showing as a previous order. To add insult to injury  several of my items are also showing as unavailable. So not only are you unable to deliver my groceries in the timeslot which I paid for  you are also unable to deliver everything that I ordered. Is this an April Fool s joke? Because it really isn t funny.  Should your delivery driver decide to make an appearance tonight  I will not be accepting anything. And I can assure you that not only will I be calling your customer services line first thing tomorrow morning to escalate this further  but I will never be using your online service again. This is completely unacceptable.  Melissa;;;;;2016-04-01T22:36:24+0000;1459550184;2016-04-02 00:36:24;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was quite happy when I arrived at the store but had steam coming out of my ears by the time I left.  If you are going to have fresh meat  fish and deli counters then surely it makes sense to actually have staff on them to serve.  I stood at the fresh meat counter for several minutes being ingnored by two men on the deli counter who were standing doing nothing.  The girl on the fish counter was having a conversation with a customer and she ignored me as well.  I don t mind waiting my turn but when I am the only one there waiting to be served it would be nice to be acknowledged at least.  This is not the first time this has happened. The Montrose store is a busy one and I would have thought that on a Friday afternoon it would make sense for all counters to be manned.  You lost sales of over £20.00 today from me.  Not a lot I know but multiply it by 52 and it mounts up.;;;;;2016-04-01T14:23:48+0000;1459520628;2016-04-01 16:23:48;0;4;0;0;4;4;2;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have been craving this product since I was 6 weeks pregnant and have eagerly been making trips to my local store and making my way to the deli aisle where I am hoping to find the little carton of green goodness waiting on me only to be immensely disappointed each time 😢😢😢 I m sure you can appreciate that pregnancy is a difficult enough time for any woman never mind being unable to satisfy mega cravings. I hope perhaps you can shed some light as to when I can expect to be able to satisfy said cravings. This is not only in the interest of keeping baba in the making happy but in the interest of public safety and others by keeping a pregnant hormonal woman happy. 😀😀😀 I look forward to your response and eagerly await my tiny little beans of joy.

I hope you take this on-board as I d like the ability to nip out on my lunch break and go to tesco to grab a sandwich and a copy of whatever was recently released  just a example  3 AAA games I tried to buy from Tesco; The Division which has 39 members alone from Uckfield (via multiplayer  that s 39 sales lost) I also tried to buy Assassins Creed Syndicate and Tony Hawkes Pro Skater 5 but none where available. Also your game prices need to be more in line with current prices  selling a 2 year old game that you can get new for £19 and you re still selling it for £44  I don t know who is responsible for keeping up to date with all this and deciding what to do but gaming is a multi BILLION $£€ business and your lack of interest hurt both consumer and profit. I hope this changes soon as there are 6 big and 4 small games I hope to buy this year and should you stock them  it would make my life easier  and I am not alone.";;;;;2016-04-01T07:26:49+0000;1459495609;2016-04-01 09:26:49;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0
