Could you please tell me why tescos has made this decision? I get very few points from tesco and this is the only way I manage to boost my points every year to take part in your online clubcard boosts. I am aware you are meant to be running some new points promotions in store  but have yet to see any sign of this and as I am a single person shopping for just me  think it s unlikely to get me any great amount of points  and certainly not the ¬£50 a year I have been getting through topcashback. Unfortunately my date for exchange is in December  so with you withdrawing at such short notice  I won t be able to use this method again üòî At this rate there seems very little point in giving tesco my business at all anymore as without the clubcard points there really is no benefit to shopping there when I have all the major 5 retailers locally and lidl  with Aldi also arriving in the next few mths.  We are getting in touch to let you know about changes to payout options available. Tesco has recently made some alterations to its Tesco Clubcard scheme and as a consequence from the 31st July 2016  Tesco Clubcard points will no longer be available as a payout method. While we realise this may be frustrating for members  TopCashback tried to do everything it possibly could to keep Tesco Clubcard as a payout method on site.   Our records show that you have either previously used Tesco Clubcard as a payout method or have registered your Tesco Clubcard to your account so if you would like to take advantage of the Tesco Clubcard payout method one last time you have until the 31st July to do so.   We have spoken with members who have previously used Tesco Clubcard as a payout method and a third told us they exchanged cashback for Tesco Clubcard points to then transfer them into airmiles points (i.e. Avios). Three in 10 swapped cashback into points for restaurants vouchers and a fifth paid for family days out.;;;;;2016-05-31T22:47:31+0000;1464734851;2016-06-01 00:47:31;0;13;0;0;13;13;4;9;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I believe the managers name is Robbie.  Most times when this happens all we get is stares and judgements from passers by. Robbie provided us with somewhere quiet to take my son to so he could calm down when I was struggling to do so in such a busy place.   So thank you very much Bicester cafe staff for helping and most importantly not judging my son. I can t tell you how amazing this is and I appreciate your kindness so very much!;;;;;2016-05-31T14:47:43+0000;1464706063;2016-05-31 16:47:43;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

We were her penultimate delivery of the day  and it was late in the evening. She still had a smile on her face despite the long shift  and not being able to park close to our house. She noticed the stair gates and baby monitor and proceeded to help me with the shopping into the kitchen  incredibly quietly so as not to wake my daughter.  I m afraid I didn t catch her name  but I didn t want this level of customer service to go unnoticed. We are in Coventry.   We were so impressed! Well done  Tesco!;;;;;2016-05-31T14:41:46+0000;1464705706;2016-05-31 16:41:46;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was about to load my shopping onto the checkout this afternoon when my son began to cry hysterically . Michelle quickly came over and kindly offered to unload my shopping from my trolley onto the conveyor. She then continued to pack my shopping into bags and accompany me to my car all so I could see to my baby. She was fantastic and really helped me out. Superb customer service and a credit to your team. I really hope she gets the recognition she deserves from this post.

Myself and my partner do not have a large budget for food shopping and so choose to shop with Tesco as you have the best value for money. According to your website  you also ensure that your packers provide the longest life available on foods.  The order we placed was delivered at 10pm on Thursday 26th May. 2 items had expired by Saturday  5 by Sunday  10 by Monday and 11 by today. The total for this food works out to be ¬£29.14. It doesn t sound like a lot but we have now had to go elsewhere to replace this wasted food (who on earth could eat 1kg of mince  950g of chicken and 16 sausages in 3 days?). These totals only relate to the expiry dates provided on your products  but many of these had already gone off prior to this date.  We do not drive  so cannot return this food to your store for a refund. As such  what would you suggest we do? We are completely unsatisfied with the quality and life of the food we have received and expect to hear from you soon.  Regards Rebecca Davis;;;;;2016-05-31T13:56:57+0000;1464703017;2016-05-31 15:56:57;0;6;0;0;6;6;4;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

However on selecting the bunches I noticed there weren t any flower bags so I went to customer services for help.  At the desk I was met by 2 ladies who looked like they didn t really want to be there. No smile. No  can I help you?   I explained I wanted a bag for the flowers so they didn t drip on me whilst I picked up a few more things. I was told quite nonchalantly that they didn t have any bags. No sorry for no flower bags. They just looked at me like it was my fault.  I explained again. One of the ladies briefly looked up at me and suggested  a tissue?  Then the other lady had the bright idea to actually look for a bag at the desk. She found one. I walked away thinking for such a giant in our food industry your customer service skills are pretty small.   I then went to tk max in Maidstone where my faith in customer service was restored. They on 2 occasions have gone above and beyond to make me a  happy customer. I will of course be congratulating them.;;;;;2016-05-30T20:59:32+0000;1464641972;2016-05-30 22:59:32;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The balloons were supposed to be used as part of a fundraising event yesterday evening for Greyhound Gap. The balloons arrived on time and I took them along to the event. Games time arrived and the balloons were blown up and attached to the attendees at the event. The idea was that they were popped by one person crushing them against another. Unfortunately the balloons are apparently made of Kevlar and they proved almost indestructible! While this is fantastic if you are using them to decorate a party or give to a child  it s terribly disappointing for a group of adults trying to raise money whilst amusing themselves in a childish way!

Was trying to make a purchase and as only one member of staff on the tills We tried to use the self service till. My husband scanned the purchase and the machine asked for and took our cash a ¬£10 note it kept asking for payment although the machine had swallowed the ¬£10. The man on the checkout eventually came and said the machine says you owe ¬£1.98 we said we had put in cash which the machine had taken and he said the machine says you owe ¬£1.98 his inference was that we were not telling the truth. By this time there was a large queue both at his till and behind us it was most embarassing. I asked why he was on his own and he rang for the manager. A tall man in a suit eventually came some minutes later. I asked why there were not more staff since it was busy and he replied it was empty a few minutes ago. He checked the machine and agreed we had deposited ¬£10 but he could not get the machine to issue our change either. Eventually I asked for our ¬£10 back so I could make my purchase elsewhere. At no time did we recieve an apoligy for our treatment and I again emphasise that we were left feeling we were in the wrong and that we had not paid for our purchase. The situation would not have arisen if Tesco did not rely on machines instead of actual staff.

They were in the bank holiday offers and I boosted my vouchers. A few hours later  I received an email to tell me that the mattress was out of stock  even though there was no mention on the website that it was out of stock. I called up explaining that I still would like a mattress and to use my vouchers and to take advantage of the bank holiday offers. They emailed me a gift card code to use when I reordered. It took about 24 hours to come through. So once it came through I called up to place another order. They told me that the mattress that I ordered this time was in stock. I was happy until I received an email saying that it was out of stock. The customer service number is now closed so if I call tomorrow to get another gift card code  by the time I get the email  the bank holiday offers would have ended and I would have to pay full price again.

Now the code is expired and I have to pay more why?  Can you honour the previous price of ¬£65.99?  Why should I have to pay extra now for the same product?

Unfortunately I was told by the lady staffing the customer service desk that the only working cart is in use. It meant my mum had to do the shopping. The point of the exercise was to persuade her I can be independent but it seems I am not. So she is meandering around a store she doesn t know looking for items on the list.   As we leave the store we find disability cart abandoned by an inconsiderate customer by the door  instead the parking spot for it. The trolley guy asked if I needed to use it and I explained that I hadn t been able to get some of the stuff I needed as I hadn t been able to get around. A manager came up with the key for it and said it had been in the office all day. He tried the key and the cart did not move  obviously the battery was discharged.   Both these latter staff did their best in the situation to remedy the lack of disabled accessibility and are a credit to Tesco s.   The sour note is that the staff member covering the customer service desk had misled me and also did nothing to remedy the situation.

There s a telephone number which I call  once I find the actual right option I get through to a customer service agent  I explain that I cannot reset my password as I cannot remember my address at the time of registration and therefore the postcode. The call starts well with the taking of my email address  then I am asked for the first line of my address  that s right the address I have already told them I cannot remember. Explain that that is the problem  if I knew the address I could find the postcode. The respond was  well  I cannot help you if you don t give it . I lost my temper and shouted at her. She said she wasn t going to be shouted at. I requested a manager. I terminated the call when the old there is not a manager available you ll have to wait trick was pulled.  The response to I cannot change my password because I don t know what the answer is and then insisting on that piece of information showed that 1 - they had not listened to me  2 - they were working a tick box exercise and cannot think outside the box  I m sure I provide my mother s maiden and a security word when I registered so long ago  3 - they could not be bothered to assist a customer. I understand that measures need to be taken to ensure data security  but intransigence is not the answer.  I have now checked the postcodes of every address I ve lived at for the last 15 years  none of the post codes match; that s 7 post codes and 8 addresses.   Tesco s accessibility rating today is zero.  Asda s minimum on-line shop is ¬£25 so I will continue to use them for on line purchases and as Sainsbury s has a better local prescence in Sheffield use them in preference. It will not make a dent in Tesco s profits but it will make me feel better";;;;;2016-05-28T21:25:07+0000;1464470707;2016-05-28 23:25:07;0;10;0;0;10;10;4;6;11;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

So  I ve got a decent amount of ¬£59 worth of Clubcard points to spend (which I appreciate may well be ¬£1 000s worth of expenditure on my Tesco credit card  but I don t care its only used for the necessities like Tesco food (delivered to my door) and fuel PLUS it s still money back converted into treats).  So I started browsing and I ve managed to get  wait for it  4 x Cineworld tickets  ¬£60 worth of Chef and Brewer vouchers  ¬£42 worth of Pizza Express vouchers (we do like our food) and 1 Countryfile 12 month magazine subscription (Dad s birthday) ALL for my ¬£59 Clubcard vouchers! And no I don t work for Tesco but maybe I should!?ü§ìü§ìü§ì;;;;;2016-05-28T10:51:39+0000;1464432699;2016-05-28 12:51:39;2;3;2;0;5;3;1;2;3;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was like huh! How! So the guy closed his till and walked me to the customer services till to find out what had happened  they were lovely and explained that I would need to call the number on my card as they were def saying  used in store  so I paid for my shopping  came home and rang club card  the person I spoke was friendly and polite and apologetic - think he said his name was Matt or Mark? He looked on his system and saw that the vouchers had been used at a store nearly 200 miles away from I live! So he promptly put the points back into my card and advised I change my passwords on my Tesco account just in case somebody has got my details somehow! Thankyou Tesco - it makes such a nice change to receive top customer services when there s an issue rather than getting hassle :);;;;;2016-05-28T10:41:06+0000;1464432066;2016-05-28 12:41:06;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Firstly I m greeted by the most ignorant staff ever who chose to talk to me like some toddler being scolded for taking mothers favourite bracelet out to play and losing it. Then they try to find it while I watch countless other people come and claim their cards without judgement. So I stand there like a lost child still reeling from my telling off only then for 15minutes later to be told they can t find it. Turns out they defecated all over procedure and shredded my card before they were supposed to. This point I m pretty annoyed and visibly upset to say the least. I then get told well sorry nothing we can do. They tell me to go to my bank to get money and a new card. Something I can t do as I m at work for 12hr shifts this weekend  if my fuel will make it that is. The girl just shrugs and walks away. Called to complain about my situation and basically got the same reaction  told they ll give more training to staff...

We go into the Market Harborough petrol station shop almost every day and spend upwards of ¬£10 each time! Today my sister was purchasing a bottle of alcohol on the meal deal - she had her ID - she was the one purchasing the items. I didn t have ID myself. I have shown my alcohol every other time I have been in there. But we were told she couldn t buy it. I drove all the way home and went back with ID - she would not sell us the bottle of alcohol that was included in the ¬£10 meal deal - which we paid ¬£10.80 for  as we had already bought the food without it.  I explained to her in surprise that my sister did that because she wouldn t sell us the alcohol! I said - you have just seen us buy the food  surely we are entitled to the bottle of fizz as part of that.   I am almost 26 years of age  my sister and I are twins  we go in nearly every day and to be treated with such suspicion from the employee who was frankly rude and blas√© about the situation - even though I had done what was asked - was dreadful.   On an evening when all I want to do is celebrate finishing my law degree  my sister had offered to buy us the meal deal  I feel angry and let down!;;;;;2016-05-27T18:18:37+0000;1464373117;2016-05-27 20:18:37;0;10;0;0;10;10;6;4;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

So  it is 07.01 in the morning and the movement of trolleys wakes us up.  This is after someone doing the same thing at 06.54 last Sunday that resulted in my going round to the garage and politely reminding the Team Leader on duty of the agreement.  Is it fair that neighbours should be disturbed at unsocial hours by staff who clearly disregard their Manager s instructions?

There looked to be hundreds of pairs but she looked through them and found a pair that she could put the lenses in. She said it would take about 20 minutes to fix swap them over so we went and did a bit of shopping.

A neighbour witnessed it and contacted Tesco. The driver came up and was apologetic but didn t remember it but I was passed onto Plexus Insurance to deal with it. Now I m told that the driver has no recollection of it happening and as the witness is my neighbour he s not independent as he could be a friend.... Frustrating isn t the word. What can I do here?!!!

I am against testing on animals and find it increasingly hard to find/locate products that are not tested on animals. What would be REALLY helpful would be if you could have a section of the cruelty free products you sell so that people like myself can go straight there instead of having to search around between all the other products to find the humane ones. Do you think there would be a possibility of this happening? I think think it would be welcomed with open arms by a lot of your customers.

The great advantage of the Tesco Extra petrol stations for me is that my car is mapped for 99ron fuel so it only gets Momentum 99 or Shell Vpower. If I am stuck I can stretch to 97ron but just enough to get me elsewhere...  So imagine my surprise when I found the Tesco Express near me does not sell Momentum 99ron... Even though it s available at other petrol stations. Not only that but SuperUnleaded 97ron is nearly 10p a litre more expensive than 99ron at the supermarket... A total rip off. Fortunately for me there s a Shell Garage a little further out!  But what astounds me is the service at this particular store. There s always a queue in the store and never enough people on the tills. But what has really P****d me off is that there are 24hr pumps that are turned off when the store is shut! I arrived home from work late last night with a choice. I had enough fuel to get to Tesco or Shell.. Knowing Shell was 24hrs but Tesco had 24hr pumps and was nearer it was an easy decision... Until at 05:15 I m sat on the forecourt with all the pumps set to  kiosk only  and not enough fuel to get anywhere else.... Where is the logic in that???? It s totally irrelevant that I ran out of fuel trying to get to another fuel station and had to walk 2 miles in the rain when you consider just how much money you must be losing every day by this poor and inconvenient decision. If your going to insist on having 24hr pump facilities that aren t switched on 24hrs a day the least you can do is or a sign on them that states  not 24hrs   so people using them know that when they need fuel outside shop opening hours to go elsewhere. Or  if it was an error and they should be 24hrs someone needs a disciplinary.;;;;;2016-05-26T06:12:23+0000;1464243143;2016-05-26 08:12:23;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

IVE had it now 3rd separate issue with Tesco in a Month!! HOW hard is it SERIOUSLY..How hard is it for you to sort out an issue that s taken 4 days to sort out  causing me unnecessary stress and various phone calls.  It s still not resolved. I seriously wonder why I shop with you. Spent 3 hours of my time at your store Monday evening  which ended up making me get stuck in heavy traffic going home  wasted my evening  resulting in causing distress and tension to family and me   whilst on your customer service phone speaking to clubcard and tesco direct over the !!!.... Boost points. You ve not resolved it. It s still causing a problem now  as now I can t take the opportunity to double up. The first time ever that I decide to double up and not use vouchers on petrol and it goes tips up....MAKE it clearer to dimwits such as me  (got the impression of being a dimwit by one your store team) ( It was embarrassing for me to see staffs reaction to a seriously confused shopper  and to be made to feel a fool  in front of other staff members)  that even though Tesco is Tesco  one company  you are all different departments. So cheers Tesco  I raise a glass to you  for your team member on the phone who dictated to team member in store to rip up my exchanged boost points receipt. Now I have no physical original points coupon or doubled points receipt to double up in store  or double up online. You sent an email tonight saying points coupon will be returned to me in next statement. Guess that will be after 26th June when the double points boost will be over!!! So GREAT  I miss out on your last deal. Ive never shopped on your website  so how the hell   am I aware that the online price is different. It s not that clear to me  or a dyslexic. Ive seem items on other company s website and it s so clear that the price is an online price.  Not that clear to me with your website. The impression I get from TESCOS website it s that price considering it says check stock available in a Tesco store. Same principle as Argos do.. Originally rung up club card Monday afternoon as I couldn t figure how to double up and also couldn t access clubcard webpage. Your clubcard team said it would be easy to double up in store and could buy the item with no hassle and it would take all the stress out of trying to get my head around the website. Like I said never shopped on your website  never printed off points vouchers. Wished I bought the item at Waitrose as friend couldve given me staff discount.. Bit late now!!!!!!;;;;;2016-05-25T22:40:37+0000;1464216037;2016-05-26 00:40:37;0;32;0;0;32;32;6;26;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I registered for a Clubcard and received it in the post a couple of months ago. I shop online frequently and almost never in store. I only have 69 points on my card from when it was scanned just this one time at the store. But it s not registering my online shop points and I should have hundreds by now.   My club card is registered to the account I have. Why are they not automatically transferring?

I received an email stating my order was ready to collect from my local store as it had been scanned in at 12.50pm today. This was also evident through the parcel tracking service. However  going to the store this evening (8pm) I was told my the deputy store manager that the store did not have the parcel. He told me I should have a received store collection email and that I couldn t have as it wasn t there. As I argued my case for receiving one  he said he would call the helpline to track the parcel and came back saying they closed at 8pm?  I however  have just called (9pm) and spoke to a representative who confirmed for me the tracking states the parcel is with the store and could even tell me the staff members name it was signed in by. The call representative phoned the store for me herself and I was put on hold. She came back telling me the store was very adamant they did not have the parcel and the member of staff it was signed in by was apparently not even in store today as she is currently away on holiday. The call representative had no other option than to order a replacement as she herself was confused with the whole situation.  This makes me question whether a staff member at your store has faked this staffs signature as acceptance for the delivery whilst they are on holiday and stole it. I can not understand how it was signed and accepted for by a staff member who was not even working. How is the tracking telling me it has be scanned in at the store and the store have no recollection of this.  Please may you help me with this very confusing and mysterious problem.  Many thanks;;;;;2016-05-25T20:35:14+0000;1464208514;2016-05-25 22:35:14;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

There is no control over the way people park in your car parks. There is regularly a line of cars right across the front of the store parked on double yellow lines  the cross hatched areas at the end of the parking bays have always got cars parked in them and the pick up and drop off lay-by is always full of parked cars. I m sure I don t need to tell you the danger this incredible selfishness causes your customers due to restricted sight lines and manoeuvring space. I do not understand why the security personnel cannot ask these people to park in one of the bays provided  they are always right at the front entrance to the store and will either be looking at a monitor or chatting to their mates on customer services so it would give them something to do. You could also put bins in the hatched areas to stop people parking in them. Could you please assure me that you will do something about this ignorant minority?;;;;;2016-05-25T12:28:45+0000;1464179325;2016-05-25 14:28:45;0;7;0;0;7;7;1;6;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I went in today to pick up some bits with my daughter and nephew  both 19 months old. My daughter had a strop on and pretty much screamed from the second I put her in the trolley. She d been very poorly the week before and hasn t been herself since. I had about 20 minutes of stares and comments from customers and was at the point of a breakdown when a lovely member of staff came up to me! She asked if there was anything she could do to help and asked if I was ok! She could clearly see I was stressed so asked if she wanted me to hold on to my trolley or help me to the tills. I declined out of embarrassment but she took me to the tills anyway and unloaded all my shopping whilst I saw to my daughter. Another worker then came over and packed all my shopping and then asked if I needed him to take it to the car for me! They both showed genuine concern for me and my daughter and went out of their way to help! They helped make a seriously stressed mums day :);;;;;2016-05-24T21:49:49+0000;1464126589;2016-05-24 23:49:49;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

As a small family on a budget I find it absurd that these items would go to waste rather than being sold to a customer reduced who could put them to use.

The fact that I cannot purchase any alcohol without an Irish drivers licence  an Irish ID card or a passport is simply discriminating.  I came from Germany to work here in Cork City. I pay my taxes  I m a responsible person and like to enjoy an evening after a rough day at the office with a glass of wine. Nothing wrong with that.  Nevertheless this is apparently a privilege that may be enjoyed by Irish habitants only. I am 25 years old and always have my European identity card with me. Not to mention that as being in Europe  I don t need to provide my passport to enter this country at the airport whatsoever. Hence it is not ensured that I even have a passport.  So why do I feel like an illegal immigrant when I am denied to purchase any kind of alcohol at Tesco.  It is humiliating and makes me feel less of a part of this Irish society in which I set foot.  For me there is no logical explanation for this policy but that Tesco only wants to have  real Irish  customers.  Thanks for reading this. Just something I needed to say.;;;;;2016-05-24T16:36:33+0000;1464107793;2016-05-24 18:36:33;11;17;12;1;30;16;7;9;16;0;11;1;0;0;0;0;0

I had run out of petrol and had to put some in. My daughter who always runs in to pay as I send her in because of the long Que. today however I had a sickness bug and also have spots I m assuming is related to chicken pox so didn t want to affect anyone else so made my 16 year old go in  she has been served petrol many times before so didn t see this as a problem before putting petrol in the car. On this attempt she was refused because of her school uniform (never have they been bothered before) as I walked into the store the cashier who was serving shouted out she was sorry but could serve someone underage since when is 16 underage to purchase petrol? I explained I had a sickness bug and she was 16 and I didn t want to infect anyone she carry on talking to me even through she had a customer.  I had to return to my car as my daughter had the cash however when I walked back into the store the cashier was telling another customer about myself and daughter loud enough for the whole line to hear.   I feel the service I received was unprofessional embarrassing and I will be telling people in the local area how appalling the store is in Chadwell st Mary s  grays.   I would also like to point out they have let my 10 year old pay for petrol in the past so if it s the case my 16 year old can t but my 10year old can I will be making a formal complaint to the relevant people.;;;;;2016-05-24T16:08:15+0000;1464106095;2016-05-24 18:08:15;0;8;0;0;8;8;5;3;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

In there shopping with my 13 year old son and his friend and when I went outside they were outside as they had been thrown out.  Apparently they were throwing a ball to each other when he came up and told them to get out. No warning just out! No even asking them to stop.  I told them outside they shouldn t be doing it and they understood that.  I took them back in the get the things they wanted whereby the security guard then proceeded to tell them to get out again. I explained they were with me and that I was supervising them.  So you think it was ok what they did he asked.  I told him I didn t and that I had told them off.  They were being disruptive he said in a busy store.  Really they were 6ft apart throwing a kids ball to each other.  Not acceptable I know but he could have at least warned them first. He was then rude to me said you re obviously a good parent then madam! They didn t even ask me if they could come back in he said. I told him I didn t know who had thrown them out so I couldn t ask him.  I asked him if they were banned  and he said no but you wouldn t think they would try to come straight back in! I said that is why I have come in with them! Absolutely disgusted with the the man rude and arrogant.  I wonder what he would have done if it was a toddler throwing a ball around.  Would he have thrown them out?;;;;;2016-05-24T16:06:12+0000;1464105972;2016-05-24 18:06:12;0;9;0;0;9;9;3;6;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Massive fail for customer service today at your Seacroft store. I left without what I needed and nobody helping me. I went in to print some photos. Easy you say! The photo machine either wasn t working or it wasn t clear how to select photos to print. I asked the nice lady in customer support. Over the course of the next 10 minutes she put 2 calls out for tech support. They are very elusive aren t they? After no one coming I asked where they were. She replied upstairs on electrical. So guess what? Your customer had to go up and get them...to be told by a lady that she was the only one there and would be 10 minutes. She seemed under pressure and got frustrated at my frustration (which is unacceptable) so I went back downstairs and asked the nice customer service lady for the duty manager to complain. Guess what?? They were too busy (now 25 minutes into my ordeal and late for work without photos) he told her to call another manager called Barry..who thankfully arrived promptly...and didn t know how to work the photo machine despite admitting his love of digital photography in his spare time. We both agreed that the machine either wasn t working or wasn t clear. Barry didn t know which. After 40 minutes  no photos and completely shocked by my experience I left the store. Barry took my name and number for a manager to call and apologise... Now an hour late for work and was even made to Pay for my lunch instead of it being offered as a good will gesture for my experience. Not I have no Photos which were urgent for my business and its cost me money. Well done Tescos!;;;;;2016-05-24T09:51:46+0000;1464083506;2016-05-24 11:51:46;3;8;3;0;11;8;1;7;2;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have recently had a baby and while trying to pack my shopping away my daughter was fairly unsettled so while packing I was also trying to settle the little one. As such I was taking a little longer than usual  however I would have thought given the circumstances this would be ok. However  while still packing the assistant began to serve the next customer. He did only have one item so the assistant maybe just thought she would quickly deal with it  however she then began to serve the next customer in the queue before I had managed to finish packing my shopping onto my pram. I felt so rushed I decided to leave the checkout area and push the pram and shopping to the small seating area near the desks to sort it out properly. I appreciate I may have taken longer than normal to get through the checkout but I feel that it is wrong that I was made to feel rushed  specially with a newborn baby. I would like to add that although I took a bit longer it was nowhere near an excessive amount of time and I was not asked if I would like any help with my packing.The checkout assistant was fairly young and possibly did not appreciate that it is stressful enough to shop with a newborn  however I would have thought that while training  this may be something that was mentioned. I would really hate this to happen to any other new mums.;;;;;2016-05-24T06:44:05+0000;1464072245;2016-05-24 08:44:05;0;6;0;0;6;6;6;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We had queued at a checkout to pay for our shopping but to also to put on this weeks lottery numbers. When we presented   our quick pay lottery card the checkout assistant politely explained that her till didnt  do  the lottery and thatonly some off them do  no  problem really  just meant another short queue at customer service desk and it was done. The suggestion is why not have a sign at the checkout that justs says Sorry lottery no available  at this till. It would maybe save someones  time  customer or customer service desk assistant.

I have been a regular shopper for a very long time and wanted to see if you would be interested in  giving back  to the local community. After numerous visits to the store and a trip with the school in which I work to go  behind the scenes  I see a lot of promotion of the community champion and the great work They do locally. However I am now raising money for a little girl in my family with a rare and severe disorder to fund private treatment that could enable her to walk and to donate to the charity reverse rett. I have tried to contact the community champion via email more than once  been in store and spoken to people who would  pass my details on  and also spoke to someone on the helpline who spoke with the store manager who took my number off of them and assured them they would call me  right away . Needless to say I still haven t been contacted by anyone and the event is fast approaching. Even if no help could be offered a simply response would have been great. I am not putting the blame on the champion  as I was told they were only allocated certain hours to work in that area. It s just a shame that you promote  getting involved in the community  but yet it s impossible for a local person to get in contact.

I have learnt today that my clubcard vouchers are now no longer valid and lost as I cancelled my order and they will not be refunded  they will be refunded in points and added to my next statement - so I now have no vouchers to get the better deal.

I spoke to TESCO Customer Services who were very unhelpful and basically said  they re the rules   come on TESCO you have an extremely fed up customer here who spends most of her earnings in your store and yes  every little helps .

Sandwich platters and things  for my beautiful little girls 5th birthday party. I ve invited 40 children  so I ordered lots of platters of sandwiches and rolls. Plenty of notice I presumed  for collection between 10-12 today- her party starts at 1pm. My husband gets there to collect (his only job tbh  I figured he couldn t get it wrong) and the man very politely informs him that there s been some substitutions on my order... That s right. Substitutions on an order that I finalised weeks ago- knowing that they d be specially ordered in and that there was a 3 days order time on them.   Now I m left having to take substitutions I didn t want because I don t have any choice  and I ve got to somehow make enough sandwiches for the children that are coming to her party!  Absolutely ridiculous that no one thought to let me know before hand that you couldn t  provide what I d ordered so I had a chance to find what I needed somewhere else! That s why I have a mobile number on my account.

During this time it was very cold  blizzard like outside so was an unusually long journey. We were thankful you were open as our regular  Asda  was closed until the morning.  As we arrived at tesco we were greated by a very polite security guard. Walking down the Isles I decided it was the sweets I craved and wanted to fulfil this empty space with what is call  mega mouth spray .  I jumped for joy when the excitement of seeing it on your shelf.  I grabbed with all my strength and we made our way to the til area.. Self service to be exact. I scanned my items  paid  collected my receip and off we went to the car for your yet long blizzard like journey home. As my employer was driving  I decided to open my  mega mouth spray  and spray the first spray...  To my discovery I realised nothing was coming out.. I looks again and checked and to my discovery I found this was empty. This had caused me much upset and emotional pain. When I further looked into why this may be the case  I discovered it had a crack in the bottom and this was result in my empty sweet. I ve now had to result in going to bed with an empty space  knowing the struggle of sleeping tonight.  I hope you are well aware of the issue this has now caused me and disappointment of now ever shopping at tesco.  Please can you advise me on the next step to take this investigation further.

Realistically  it s not that hard to do but when you have to do it before eating anything it s a real inconvenience. Hardly any of your food items have the total amount of carbs displayed in the nutrition and it is even worse when something is a part of a multipack and doesn t have full nutrition information on it. Please consider changing your packaging and it would make mine and probably so many other type 1 diabetic customers lives a lot easier  as we could actually eat our food straight away without having to faff about with carb counting!!;;;;;2016-05-21T20:34:03+0000;1463862843;2016-05-21 22:34:03;2;3;2;0;5;3;1;2;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I made them aware of the five Devon stores who have introduced the practice of placing pint cartons of milk with other drinks next to sandwiches  regarding which an article had been written in this week s Farmers Weekly. This had proved such a success that consideration was being given to rolling this out nationally.   The store is one of the main choices of lunch for children from the local High School  and they were willing to listen to my comments regarding the fact that children would be more likely to drink milk that was easily accessible. Also  with milk being one of the only two safe drinks for teeth  ideal for if to be offered in this manner.  Thank you Tesco....look forward to seeing this in store....and possibly considered elsewhere?  #milkandsarnies;;;;;2016-05-21T15:45:35+0000;1463845535;2016-05-21 17:45:35;2;1;3;1;5;1;1;0;1;0;2;1;0;0;0;0;0

I use your newtownabbey store regularly. could you please invest in a few more of those wee car/trolleys as you only have two there. Last week my wife and 2 year old daughter went shopping  the two car/trolleys were in use. We told our daughter who was not amused that we were going for a coffee 1st anyway and hopefully there would be one available by the time we had finished.  5 mins later we sat down with with our coffee and at that moment I spotted the car/trolley emerging from a checkout. I can see one  ill go and get it I said to my daughter (daddy the hero).  I could see there was a young lady who had two kids with her  I didn t want to rush her so instead of asking could I have it after her I thought I would wait until she had discarded it. I then found myself stalking this young lady from checkout to car. As she passed me at the main door I didn t make eye contact instead I pretended to be on the phone.I looked over at my daughter who was waiting for her daddy to return and I thought   what if another dad was watching and waiting  I had to get closer.  So after a few james bond like car park menouvers I found myself casually walking by as the young lady placed the last bag of shopping in the boot.   could I have that  I asked in calm and collected manner.  Yes sure she replied  oblivious to the mission that I had just completed in the lead up to this question.  As I pushed the trolley through the main entrance I could almost hear the whole store and my daughter cheer me as if I had saved Christmas.  Of course there was no cheering but a huge smile from my daughter was thanks enough.  Anyway back to the point   as I fear one day even my james bond manoeuvres may not be enough to ensure a pleasent shopping trip. Please invest in a few more car/trolleys as 2 is not enough.   Thanks;;;;;2016-05-21T14:37:24+0000;1463841444;2016-05-21 16:37:24;25;2;26;1;29;2;2;0;5;0;24;1;0;0;0;0;0

I didn t do this for a while because I found the wait  while the bottle was retrieved  a bit off-putting. Perhaps a few people did  because the bottles are back in the boxes these days. Due to an oversight  for which I blame nobody (for we are fallible  and to err is human  to forgive divine)  the security tag was not removed from my Dalwhinnie  so the alarm sounded as I left the shop. I returned to the store  receipt in hand  and went to Customer services. Unfortunately  I was not able to attract anyone s attention. Had I the patience of Job  and no son to pick up in three minutes  time  I should have waited until all customers were served  all cigarette packets straightened and all watches checked. As it was  I stood in the barriers  waving my arms and calling  Hello?  hello? Can anyone help me?  as the alarm sounded. Answer came there none  so I gave up and left  the cacophony receding as I strolled into the car park. This is the second time this has happened - the first instance playing out identically to today s. I shall decant the spirit so that I don t feel like a criminal when pouring a dram  and return the empty bottle  with tag  next week. No harm has been done  but I feel that if nobody is too concerned about the alarm sounding  could we just do away with the tags  sensors and barriers  and save a bit of time and money?;;;;;2016-05-21T12:29:41+0000;1463833781;2016-05-21 14:29:41;0;6;0;0;6;6;1;5;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I went to the Ammanford store specifically to buy a packet of Kellogg s Ancient Grain cereal  a product I have purchased from here on numerous occasions. The shelves were full to brimming. Yum  yum  methinks. But it was not to be because apparently  the computer said no . After a very long wait at the till for someone to be called over  I finally gave up the will to live  as did everyone else in the queue; life is too short to be standing at a checkout. It was only after I had already paid and was leaving with a rumbling stomach that someone turned up to deal with the problem. To add insult to injury  he stood there clutching the packet to his chest as if I was going to grab it from it and make a run for it. I must say this crossed my mind  but by now I was too weak with hunger to have made the exit. If this product is not on your system  why bother to have shelves stacked with it? I am fed up with incidents like this (I also had one last week) so I ve gone from being a loyal Tesco shopper to one who now only comes in to buy something I can t get elsewhere first. Hardly surprising is it when I m faced with petty rules and regulations.";;;;;2016-05-21T09:21:36+0000;1463822496;2016-05-21 11:21:36;0;4;0;1;5;4;3;1;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Just a thought but maybe you need to employ more than one security man ü§î  It s not the first time I have gone to this store on a Friday at around 19.00hrs. after work and been subjected to hassle  noise & grief from young people in & around the store...  They are in & out of the store  up & down the  Travelator   hanging around the covered car park and tonight in particular running up & down the front of the store  the covered car park consistently has young drivers revving their engines  driving  recklessly  up and down the car park aisles  music so loud that everybody has to listen whether we like it or not! There are times - like tonight when I had to watch them manoeuvring around the car park - albeit slowly  to the annoyance of a customer just driving in to the car park!  I have been sat waiting for my cab on several occasions and seen the Security man attempt to move the groups of young people standing about & the ones who just sit in their cars  revving their engines & subjecting us all to their  tunes ... The young people just laugh and taunt him  what can he do?  There are A4 laminated signs dotted about stating that Tesco will not tolerate loitering by young people as it affects customers and the local Police will take action ( words to that effect)  Well Tesco the local Police do not take action  I know this because tonight I had to wait 40 minutes for a cab and unfortunately had the time to be subjected to all that I have stated previously!  I sit on the train from work and dread walking in & out of your Hednesford store  it is a horrendous experience!!!  It s about time this issue - which you are obviously aware of is addressed?

How can anyone shop when you have every isle full of stocking carts 20 minutes before its due to close. This is worsened by a request to one of the staff to move a cart in order to reach an item and be told this isle is closed!! It doesn t make sense to me. Why employ your till staff till 11pm when you cannot actually shop in the store for 20 minutes before closure.

The sales assistant saying to her    I can t help you GO AWAY    after the lady walked away from phone section I was very concerned. I took it upon myself to follow the lady and approached her to see if she was Ok . She mentioned the disrespectful way that Judith had spoken to her when asking for help. It appears the elderly lady was asking for help for due to being hospitalized for 11 Months and not being able to use Tesco Mobile Network because there was never no signal to make important phone calls. This is totally unacceptable for one of your staff to be talking to customers let alone Elderly vulnerable people. I know others that have received the very arrogant   Unhelpful manner this Sales Assistant ( Judith ) has   I would like this followed up please and feedback received   Totally Unacceptable on your employees !!;;;;;2016-05-20T18:33:24+0000;1463769204;2016-05-20 20:33:24;0;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

A chap was unloading bread & heard me freaking out to my mum  he kindly went out of his way to ask what brand it was & told me he knew there was a delivery outback that hadn t yet been unloaded. He promptly went off & found it for me & came back & searched for us while we shopped. This might not be a big deal to some  but for my son & our family this meant a lot.

I had popped in with my two children after collecting the youngest from nursery.  We were sat in the cafe  when suddenly my 2 year old starting having the tantrum from hell. I couldn t quite believe it.  Everyone literally was staring and I felt so bad for your other customers as nothing was working.  I had to get him into the trolley (as he was sat in a high chair). He was stiffening up his body and kicking out. One employee who was on a break in the cafe came over to offer to help me keep the trolley still  as it was moving everywhere with no joy of getting him in. A big thank you number one. Then when he was blowing the roof off with his tantrum  your cafe manager came over with a packet of chocolate biscuits for him. Even though at that moment he was having none of it  it did eventually help. A big thank you number 2. Then the lovely lady who served us at the cafe came over with some pieces of baby and some colouring crayons. A big thank you number 3. I actually felt like crying  out of thanks to your staff for being so kind and trying to calm my little boy down. It was really appreciated. I hope this message gets to your Stretford store. As I would love them to know that the acts of kindness they offered (no matter how small) it really made a huge impact.

I received my letter through the post weeks ago and waited patiently for the  last ever  clubcard boost. Been saving my vouchers and was really pleased to learn that my chosen item was included in the boost. So at 8am on Monday I logged into my account on put my chosen item in my basket - A Dyson V8 Animal Cordless. The price had mysteriously been  boosted  too but I didn t mind too much because I was using vouchers. Unfortunately once the item was in my basket I got a notice to say that the item was no longer in stock and I could  save  it for later. I tried the V8 Absolute as an alternate but got the same result. So today I thought I d check to see if the product was back in stock. It s there  reduced by ¬£70 back to the pre-boost price and it s been taken off the offer. How can you do this? It s not even been a week. Does anyone actually get to buy these items or do you falsely advertise popular items  then pretend they re out of stock so that you don t actually have to honour the promotion. I have read the T&C s and I understand that Tesco reserves the right to withdraw items  but at least sell some first. Or hold enough stock volume to cover the first day of the promotion. What am I saying! YOU DO HAVE STOCK! You re just a bunch of con artists. Please remember that I did have to buy from Tesco over a prolonged period in order to collect these vouchers.

I usually buy around 10 packs at a time  then wash and freeze them to later add to our breakfast every morning. I have been trying to get some for a few weeks now  but they never seem to be in stock lately. Although I usually buy them from Tesco  in my despiration I also checked Ocado and Waitrose  and they don t have any either. The shelves are over-full with non-organic raspberries  but I would rather go without than buy these. I know that most people who want organic might just buy the non-organic ones  but doing this might make major retailers believe there is no demand for organic. If there is a shortage  this would tend to suggest that your growers are growing way too many non-organic raspberries (a large percentage of which will have to be sold at a reduced price)  and nowhere near enough organic to cope with demand.;;;;;2016-05-20T07:14:29+0000;1463728469;2016-05-20 09:14:29;0;7;0;0;7;7;1;6;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

One dude even looked at me with disgust!  Then we went to the till and a couple stared at me on and off and you can both hear and see that they talked about me. It wasen t discrete and a lot of people spotted it but no one did anything  especially none of your staff.   I m not supposed to have to defend my own body in your shops  absolutely ridiculous.

Despite the box being obviously mishandled at some point the damage was more than likely done before it was packaged at the factory.  I phoned up hoping to arrange an exchange for a different model only to be told this was not possible due to the item being purchased on the Boost with Clubcard vouchers.  All they could offer me was a straight swap for the same model or vouchers re-issued via post.  Is this my only option? The reason I ask is the person on the Phone did not sound too sure himself and given the option I would much prefer a different model due to the issues I had with the first.

We stopped in Costa Coffee in clearwater and I noticed my little girl had leaked from her nappy. So I ran into your store to pick up a set of clothes  baby wipes and nappy as I left her changing bag at home. I got to the self service till and started to scan them in. The clothes and wipes scanned in and when I went to scan the pampers(which were 2 packs for 22euro) it wouldn t scan in. After about 5 minutes of waiting for a staff member to come help me  your very unhelpful staff member came over. He tried to put the bar code in manually and when it wouldn t go in he told me he can t sell them to me. I explained the situation to him and had my little girl beside me soaked and he shurged his shoulders. I told him the price and he looked at me blankly. He didn t even try to help. I m sure he could of went or even asked someone else to get a price but no  he left me standing there with my wet child. I will never shop in your store again. I am in shock of how inhuman ur staff are.;;;;;2016-05-19T15:34:11+0000;1463672051;2016-05-19 17:34:11;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Maybe also list the items that will last  less than you d like them to   as are sometimes noted on the receipt too.

That day there was a problem with the chiller cabinets and so many choices weren t visible. When I asked if a salad was on the menu  the staff were very helpful and a delicious ham salad was made up for me.  Today  for the first time  we went into the caf√© at the Beeston store. No sign of salad  I ask and get a puzzled look and a suggestion that maybe they could  put some lettuce and cucumber on a plate with one of the main courses.  That no store does a plated salad. I suspect my first time in here will be my last.  I was disappointed with the lack of healthy choices; the reason I wanted the salad was some idea of what is in the food. All of the available dishes seemed to be laden in cheese (macaroni or lasagna) or in soggy looking pastry. My son had the Mac...it comes with chips...and baked beans (no peas left  it s not even 1pm yet!). The server  upon hearing my concern  rudely pointed at the jacket potatoes - he said I should get that...they come with tuna in full fat Mayo  cheese...or beans (I don t like those).

After work  I had picked my husband up and we went to our local tesco for tonight s tea and tomorrow s lunch. Tonight s tea we decided on the meal deal which came with a side dish  dessert and a bottle of wine. Quite clearly an adult type of shop and being as we are both nearly 30 (and look around our age) were surprised when we got asked for ID. My husband had his  but I didn t have mine. Because of that  the woman had to reverse most of the shop that we had put through.   Now I understand having to ask for ID  I understand people fear their jobs for potentially serving underage. I understand that the  ask 25  was brought in to have a reason to ask for ID to those who look over 18  but may not be - it s a safe thing to do.  But come on Tesco  surely your staff should have at least a little bit of common sense about them?!  In this example - you have a couple with wedding rings on  one with ID stating they are 29  the other with car keys in hand paying with a credit card that states  mrs  buying a meal deal that comes with a bottle of wine - not a basket full of vodka... very obvious that they are over the age of 18 and are legal to purchase alcahol - the cashier may not have been sure if we were over 25 years old  but surely - common sense and not being a complete jobsworth should have taken over at this point?!  As I said - please give your staff some training rather than just having them ask everyone for ID. The amount of ridiculous stories I hear  but to be personally truly frustrated at a person who is a representative of Tesco... it has made me not want to shop there if I don t happen to have my ID on me on the way home from work - I may not be able to purchase deodorant spray  candles maybe  or even plastic knives?!

My garden is currently very messy.   On Tuesday I get the call I ve been waiting for...  Its the suppliers and I m extremely excited until!!!!  He tells me they no longer make this paving and haven t for some time.    OMG!  What the hell am I going to to do..

About a week or so ago I purchased a couple of skincare products from my local Tesco. My skin is very dry  so the stuff I got was to help clear it up. Only it made matters worse.. My face is now completely covered in dry patches and feels very rough... I was actually recommended these products and was told I could buy them in my local tescos so I bought them to give them a try... Now my face is worse than what it was.

I know the sandwich was the cause as it was the only thing I ate on Monday morning approx 6 hours before the symptoms started.   I appreciate that tesco must follow all food hygiene regulations but at some point during either the preparation or  Storage of this sandwich it has either been contaminated or the storage temps have not been correct.

So I m now posting it on here......  I visited the Helston Tesco store this evening with my local Beavers group. Although the other kids had a good time  my son on the other hand didn t. You were given notice that my son has Coeliac Disease  therefore would not been able to join in making bread  yes  he said he d wear gloves  but how could a 6 year old enjoy making bread with gloves that were even too big for adults and the fact he would be making a bread to take home  he couldn t even eat?! Yes  he got upset and I had to take him out of the room  because he couldn t understand why he couldn t enjoy it like the others. After calming him down  he then kind of enjoyed the rest of the visit. And then....low and behold  when giving the other children their bread  my son was given NOTHING!! It wasn t until other parents were offering to go and buy him something from the Free From section in front of the lady leading the visit  she then unwillingly went across to the staff cafe  and got him a banana and a pot of fruit!  I mean seriously  a pot of fruit!  which would never of been given to him if it wasn t for other parents aiming hints!! Where was the harm in just getting him a loaf of bread which was just downstairs from his section and put in a bag so he wasn t made to feel different and left out!! I am completely disappointed and angry that yet again my son was pushed out  and not by his choice. This is a medical condition  not a choice! He is 6 and still doesn t quite understand  and people wonder why he gets so upset!! Absolutely disgusting. No reason at all why something wasn t arranged for him considering the amount of notice given.

However  I m continually disappointed by the state the store is in at that time of night.

I understand it s a quiet time with not many customers in store  but it is still a hazard to those that want to use the store at night.

(I ve been informed I can t name the store or actual person for legal reasons)  A went over and beyond in customer service with a recent dilemma I was faced with when trying to work out how best to order food for my sons christening.  The christening was to take place on a Sunday morning however I needed to be able to set the food up at the venue prior to the church service at 10.30am.  I wanted to order fresh food and collect/receive it as close to the actual morning as I could. Having absolutely no family locally or anyone to call upon that wasn t going to be at the christening themselves  A was my absolute hero of the day.  He suggested I order the food online for the first delivery slot of the actual day and he personally would speak to the online team regarding me collecting it from store instead of it going out on the lorry.  As the day drew nearer and the online team not being sure my order would be processed in time  A decided he didn t want to leave it to chance. He came into work on his day off and personally said  if the order wasn t ready for me to collect by 9am  he would deliver it direct to the venue himself.  This true act of kindness was overwhelming to me. It prevented such worry as to how I would a) sort all the food myself and b) if anything went wrong on the day. He simply took my worries away. I couldn t be more grateful. This was exceptional service and the party food quality was lovely  everyone was commenting on the day.  Please pass on my thanks and appreciation to A  a credit to your store and a great person. Thank you x;;;;;2016-05-17T17:40:26+0000;1463506826;2016-05-17 19:40:26;7;3;7;0;10;3;1;2;1;0;7;0;0;0;0;0;0

I did wait longer  until the next day in fact.  On Monday 16th I still had no e-mail so phoned Customer Support again.  The woman said she would personally send me an e-mail with the link to reset password  and did while I was on the phone to her.  She said it should come within 15 minutes.  I waited an hour again and still no e-mail.  I phoned Customer Services again to check they had my e-mail correctly.  They did.  I also had checked my junk mail folder  and my blocked list  and Tesco were not in either.  They put me through to  a computer or I.T. team .  The guy said he would cancel my account completely and then I could simply re-register online; he said I could try in 4 hours time but that it could take up to 24 hours.  I did try after 4 hours  no luck  so left it 27 hours.  On Tuesday 17th (today) I tried to re-register online and it said my e-mail was already registered.

Not a happy bunny that it has so far taken me 3 days to try and place an order.  Customer Services said they dont know why this is happening but would ring me back.  Lady phoned me back to say that my account HAD NOT BEEN CANCELLED the day before (Tesco  why not??) and that she would do it right now while I was on the phone.  She said to wait 24 hours and then re-register.  I told her that is exactly what I was told yesterday.  That will be 4 DAYS TO PLACE AN ORDER!!!

So off I skip to my nearest store  money in hand to buy my goods. I get to the store and see before me a wide range of lovely fresh fruit. Scan my eyes to the right and see another mouthwatering display of fresh vegetables....but wait.... where are the onions?? I search and search but cannot find them. I see a member of staff putting out that mornings delivery so I thought  Ah they just haven t put them out yet . Alas the lovely employee sadly informed me that you did not supply the store with onions. :( no brown  no red  no shallots  not even ready chopped! So here I sit  typing this out  eating my lonely egg sandwich with a tear running down my cheek  thinking of the onion that might have been. Now I know some might say that I could have went somewhere else  however where I live  my closest store is a Tesco express. I know that  express  stores have limited stock availability but considering that  it is the only store that isn t a 3 mile camel ride away I think you are missing out on a winner here. So I beg you Tesco  please supply my local with our beloved onions! Plus I m pretty sure this is discrimination of the onion lovers!

On the 27th April I went to collect a PS4 click-and-collect from your Manford Way Tesco Express. When I arrived  the box had already been opened and I was offered a refund. I took the PS4 to test whether it was okay  and after a couple of weeks had worked out there were some problems with both the HDMI and ethernet port.  I called Tesco Direct on the 13th May to get an exchange for a new  fully-working PS4 and I requested an on-the-doorstep exchange for today. I later received an e-mail telling me the item was being sent to the Manford Way store. When I called up and queried why it was not being sent to my home  I was told they were unable to change it and that I would have to pick it up from the store.  A later e-mail informed me that it would be delivered to the store between 10:36am and 11:36am. I arrived after this time  and was told that the delivery had not come and that I should return at 3pm. When I returned after 3pm  I was told that the delivery had been signed for but that the item had been returned and was no longer in the store. The staff were very unhelpful and unsympathetic  and told me to go to the Barkingside store  either to swap the PS4 for a new one there  or to speak to their customer service to resolve the issue (rather than the Manford Way staff dealing with the problem). I spoke to a very pleasant and helpful lady called Tracy there  who tried her very best to get in contact with Manford Way and find out the problem. However  the store would not answer their phone. After being there for about an hour and a half  Tracy had obtained that Suget from Manford Way signed for the item at 10:42am (an hour BEFORE I was told that the item was not in store) and I went back to Manford Way with this information because no one could get in contact with them from Barkingside customer service.  I returned and spoke to the Manford Way manager  who had no idea what had happened to the item. She rang Suget  and handed me the phone to talk to him directly. He told me  they took it back  with no details of who or why. After a long wait  I was told by the manager that they had rung Tesco Direct and that I would be able to obtain a new one. I left the store  rang Tesco Direct and was told that they had received no such call or information. I am still waiting for them to return my call  despite assuring me they would call back within the hour.  I had planned this evening with my friends centred around my new PS4  so not only has my day been wasted  my evening has been ruined too. I am appalled by the lack of care and attention taken by Manford Way staff towards me and my problem. I have wasted both time and money  as well as a day off of work  pursuing my PS4 which has apparently vanished into thin air. I have never experienced such a disregard for customer satisfaction and correct procedure. I work in retail myself and I cannot fathom how such unbelievable inattentiveness can be tolerated in a store such as yours.;;;;;2016-05-16T17:10:35+0000;1463418635;2016-05-16 19:10:35;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

You sent me information weeks ago regarding double your clubcard vouchers starting again today.  So  as I needed a new freezer  I decided to wait and use my vouchers to one.  Went through your website and chose the one and only one that would fit my space and have just been on to buy it and get to checkout where it says that all my vouchers are unavailable to use  as its not a freezer sold by Tesco.  How ridiculous! It s on your website.  Now I ve waited over two weeks for a new freezer when I could have just gone to Argos and purchased one immediately.

This weekend I took my grocery delivery  amongst which I had nappies for my daughter. However they were unable to send my selected nappies and instead chose a replacement of the next size up!!!  How on earth could someone think a nappy to fit a 15lb child could be replaced with one for a 20lb - 40 lb child?  Seriously  no sense or thought at all?!  So I of course rejected for refund  I then had to spend petrol and time for my other half to go to a store and buy the ones we wanted.  On top of that  yet again bags over loaded  (I pay for bags and yet they seem to think it s fine to over fill so they break!). Heavy tins and items then put into the crates on top of soft fruit bread and eggs.  To say I am fed up with the total uselessness of the home delivery packers is an understatement  I have spoken to the store on numerous occasions and it seems nothing is done  Please can the Sudbury Tesco store either train their staff or employ some with a few brain cells that have common sense enough to get the job done properly.;;;;;2016-05-16T08:12:39+0000;1463386359;2016-05-16 10:12:39;0;5;1;0;6;5;2;3;1;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0

No sign of it on the Friday so I called again to be rudely advised that despite the tracking page confirming it was dispatched on the 4th May  this actually did not mean it was dispatched and could mean it was awaiting collection from the warehouse.  After hearing this we made alternative arrangements to get something else. With still no sign of his main present on the Monday or Tuesday we have since been on holiday and arrived home today to find no effort has been made to deliver his present.

I have no idea whatsoever of the foundation of this radical claim and so I asked for an explanation.  She assumed I was another person therefore  for she briefly mentioned of an incident whereby a person had been accosted (sic) outside the shop  but after my repeated request of at what time and date I was not informed.  Within seconds of her choosing to enter into a dialogue with me  she resumes serving customers at the tills alongside at least two other staff members yet claimed I was interrupting the customer.  Several minutes later she claimed she was going to check a database to verify the identity of the actual barred person.  Her tone and attitude throughout was insistent of her assertation that I could not possibly be some other person and arrogant.   It felt somewhat like a medieval public flogging.  I am ashamed of Tesco at the complete failing of the judgement of the shop assistant (and moreover the fact no colleague intervened because there was doubt of my identity).  I will from now on feel apprehension of entering any Tesco shop as a result.  If given the opportunity to clear my name at the time  it would have given my continued freedom to enter this particular shop.  I was unable to have any resolution to the accusation  and therefore I deem it an act of slander.  I felt utterly humiliated and indignant having had a public display of apparent wrong-doing.  I am very serious in what I say and I expect you solemn consideration on this matter of utmost importance.  My next steps will include Social Media and potentially instructing of my lawyer regarding this matter.  I await your full and prompt response.;;;;;2016-05-15T16:06:02+0000;1463328362;2016-05-15 18:06:02;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My 7 year old daughter joined me by the pump and I was told over the tannoy that she wasn t allowed to be there and needs to get into the car. She did this  whilst I finished fuelling. When I asked the staff why this was the case they stated Under 16s are not allowed by the pump. Your Signage states that Under 16s are not allowed to USE the pump. If this is the case you need to change these signs as they are misleading. Otherwise your staff need to be briefed on the correct procedures. I look forward to receiving your response.;;;;;2016-05-15T14:29:50+0000;1463322590;2016-05-15 16:29:50;3;13;3;1;17;13;5;8;1;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am coeliac so went to the free from section  the only thing i could take was biscuits so i noticed finest spicy ginger cookies i took one of the several pacs there. I ran for my train and started eating the biscuits.   i had eaten two before i realised they were ordinary biscuits and had been put in wrong section.  I am now quite ill as my guts have been damaged by the gluten. Whilst I clearly should have read the label better the issue was caused by your staff putting ordinary food in with all the free from food. Coeliacs are very careful and I do read labels but when in a store you trust with a free from section you expect it to be free from products  sometimes we are in a rush and this can mean we put our trust in you.   Please ask all your stores to check the free from sections and remove items that should not be there. This is an chronic illness and I know I will be sick for some time due to this.;;;;;2016-05-15T14:15:02+0000;1463321702;2016-05-15 16:15:02;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

This weekend however seemed to be the worst with absolutely no running water  so not being able to wash/brush teeth or even flush the toilet. With nobody seeming to do anything to fix it  Tescos Blue Boar in Norwich this morning have turned up with a van full of bottled water to dish out to the community  with even tescos staff bringing them in their personal cars.

Can you please tell me why you sell your Genius GF Seeded Bread at ¬£3.00 a loaf yet my local Aldi can sell it at ¬£1.89. Either they will go out of business due to making a loss or you have jumped on the GF band wagon and are charging an extortionate price. Some of us have no choice but to have a gluten free diet and it takes a huge lump out of our food budget.;;;;;2016-05-14T21:40:38+0000;1463262038;2016-05-14 23:40:38;2;4;2;0;6;3;3;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I broke my foot before coming on holiday to Sheringham - so I am in a cast for a few weeks and struggling with the crutches the NHS gave me. I haven t been able to hire a wheelchair as no where is open Saturdays.  We went to your store to buy some supplies for the week and used one of the courtesy wheelchairs in store. When we finished I was about to return the chair to the customer services I believe the store GM was there and I joked about borrowing the chair. When my wife then actually returned the chair after filling up our taxi. The lovely lady on the service desk came back out with it and asked for our details!!!

The lady on the customer services desk who held my hand and gave me tissues when I cried during an anxiety attach earlier today. My car had a puncture in the car park.  Sean was without a knight in shining armour.  He talked to me gently to help calm me and told me about his sister who has anxiety   he was so very kind.  He then took me back to the car park   collected his own jack  wheel brace and air pump.  He changed my wheel swopped them around and then checked the air pressure in all my tyres because he knew I needed to feel safe. I m still feeling a little shaky but I m home safe and sound.  In a world quick to criticise I want es to compliment and thank Sean   I  don t know how I would have coped without historic help and understanding.  It s goods to know that mental health issues are already being understood by big corporate companies like Tesco.  Tesco you are fortunate to employ such a superstar as Sean.  Please arrange a pat on the back for him   he went above and beyond. It wasn t an Every Little that helped   it was enormous.

Myself and partner were purchasing alcohol and we needed iD which is understandable as we do look young. My partner was unable to provide proof of age so we were unable to get the alcohol in which I also understand due to the think 25 policy. However the lady at the checkout then refused to sell an age 12 DVD... My partner is 28 and I am 20 so I think this was a bit over the top. I asked the lady if I could run to the car to get my partners ID and I would only be a moment or 2 and she said that because she was busy I was unable to do this and would have to pay for the shopping I had and then come back in to repurchase the goods. Her attitude was awful and customer service skills were poor. I understand your staff have a job to do and accept this. However not allowing me to nip to the car and get ID and being refused an aged 12 dvd is a joke and poor reflection on the company and that store.

I can t find the right place to feedback on your website so I m going to do it here!  I was sat at your click and collect site in New Malden today (which is fabulous - I love the ladies there)  watching a man put individual items into his own bags because he didn t want to pay 40p for the plastic bags (or he cares for the environment of course which is equally possible) and it struck me that he was putting groceries from your store into competitors bags when he could have been putting them into your bags for life. I wonder if you would consider therefore setting up a scheme at the click and collect stations where customers could have the option of buying bags for life when they shop online.  You could pack the shopping into the bags for life.  Then the next time we bring back the empty bags for life and you give us the shopping in more bags for life.  And so on.  Like we used to with the milk bottles when we were kids!  I appreciate that sometimes people would forget their bags so sometimes more bags might end up out than in but perhaps it would be worth trialing.  It would probably be a scheme that people buy into rather than buying the bags individually.  The ladies at New Malden seemed to think it would make their lives a whole lot easier.  Food for thought?  And sorry if I ve put this in entirely the wrong place!;;;;;2016-05-14T14:50:21+0000;1463237421;2016-05-14 16:50:21;4;7;4;0;11;7;3;4;4;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Broke once  got it repaired  broke again  returned for a refund.  All good so far  but wait .... Having phoned customer services off we drive to the local store to return the PS4 and arrange a refund.  So a very nice lady at the local store gets onto Customer Services  who action the refund but before you can say  knife  - problem is they did it without checking with me HOW I would like the refund.  I tried to intervene  but no ... don t interrupt our process  click  it s done.  Money has been returned to the card on which you paid.  Great  but I was trying to say I don t want it refunded to that because the account is closed!     Lady at store says don t worry  check the email and you will be able to call the number on the email.  However  no number ... so another drive back to the same lady at the local store who phones Customer Services  who say they can t do anything - my Bank will have to transfer the money into the correct account. (Lady at store now embarrassed at how unhelpful Customer Services are).   Next morning I am at the Bank  who tell me they can t just transfer money from a payee to any account I say without reference back to the payee - could be fraud.  Fair enough!  (Note how reasonable and patient I am being).  I need to give Tesco the new account number  so that once the payment is bounced back to them they can pay it.   This afternoon (that s 24 hours now since problem first arose) I am on to Tesco again.   oh no  they say  we can t do anything without the previous account details.   ok  says I - I have the account number and sorting code you sent the money to.  But NOOO -  that s not good enough!  they say  we need the card number  they say.  The account is flipping closed  says I  I don t have the old card number it was destroyed.   Go back to your bank  says Tesco  they ll sort it out .  So now I am spitting feathers!  They won t budge an inch - keep passing the buck back to me.  Everyone else manages to transfer money using a sorting code and account number  but that s not good enough for Tesco apparently!   SO  now I have no PS4  no refund and will have to spend my Saturday afternoon seeing if my Bank can help me. TESCO S SUCKS!!!  I am never shopping there every again.;;;;;2016-05-14T13:34:36+0000;1463232876;2016-05-14 15:34:36;0;7;0;0;7;7;4;3;9;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The first time this happened I put it down to my error  however today I was convinced that I had received the green order confirmation banner last night  just after 10pm  to confirm that my amendments had been made. In order to save my sanity  I logged into your site to check the items in my delivery  and received an error message to state that the changes had not been able to be made as the order was already being processed. We contacted your Customer Services department who were extremely helpful and agreed to take our issue up with your technical teams. As agreed they then called us back  to advise that your technical team had advised that this was a  known issue  where intermittently  orders amended after 10pm which are being delivered early (10am?!) did not get updated. You can imagine how shocked I was to hear that you are aware of this issue  however still allow customers to make changes way after this time. I would be grateful of an explanation please as to why this is being allowed to happen and why you think the refund of the delivery charge and a ¬£10 voucher is satisfactory compensation for an order that clearly isn t what I was expecting.  Many thanks.;;;;;2016-05-14T10:46:10+0000;1463222770;2016-05-14 12:46:10;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

How many customers think so? Most of you. Give me  strength. You eat these open fruits immediately? I thought you would rinse them first before consumption. Obviously not especially as they have pesticides on them and many people touch them with dirty hands or even after they ve been replaced if they have been on the floor.

My 16 year daughter took my 2 year old son for a short walk to the above store as she does regularly.....unfortunately he fell over outside and cut his knee very badly. She went into the store and asked if they had any plasters. The staff at the tills actually commented on how nasty the cut looked and instead of getting a first aider to help they simply pointed to where their very limited supply of medical goods were and told her she could buy a box of plasters!!!!! As the brilliant big sister she is  that is what she did but she had no wipes  antiseptic or even a tissue to clean him up. No help from the staff at all. Whilst I understand the accident didn t happen inside your shop  common decency would have been to help a small child in pain and distress Surely a sale of a box of plasters doesn t come before compassion......

I today returned a pair of shoes which have never been worn and were faulty.  I did not keep the receipt as I was not expecting to take them back.  I was treated like a criminal and eventually was told I could exchange them however my size was not in stock so I asked if I could change them for a different pair and pay the difference. At 1st they were not going to do this but then agreed.  However they would not give me a receipt so I have no proof of purchase if this pair proves to be the same standard as the others   I was told I could not have a receipt as I didn t have the original receipt .  If the way I was treated today is how you treat all your customers I am not surprised you are losing  customers;;;;;2016-05-13T18:28:17+0000;1463164097;2016-05-13 20:28:17;0;5;0;0;5;5;4;1;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

So they want to rip one of their loyal customers off for an extra ¬£27 & they have the cheek to suggest they value loyalty! My advice is check before purchasing anything with them as they obviously don t care  the best Tesco Bank Insurance can come up with when tackled is the following response -    Your existing policy is underwritten by Royal Sun Alliance. However  the new quote is underwritten by Tesco. As different underwriters have different ways of calculating a risk this is why prices can differ.   I can appreciate your frustration as it s still a Tesco policy but I hope I have explained why there can be a difference between a renewal and a new policy. I would like to point out that it is not always the case that a new policy will be cheaper.   A typical response from an uncaring organisation  they don t deserve customers.;;;;;2016-05-13T15:40:03+0000;1463154003;2016-05-13 17:40:03;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

It s not a battery issue.   We purchased Ewan the dream sheep at the end of January in preparation for our April baby. She arrived on the 18th April and since then Ewan has been playing in her cot to soothe her.   The dilemma we have is our new born is now reliant on this sheep to sleep as it s soothing. I didn t expect the item to break it hasn t even had a months use. I can t send it back and then wait ages for a replacement. Would It be possible to send us a new one to our local Tesco and I can take the broken one in on the same day when it arrives  then there is no loss to my new born?  Thank you.

However  the majority of the processed foods you sell have ridiculous amounts of these ingredients - the salt content is particularly bad and very frightening to think that people are giving this stuff to themselves and their kids. Your raw frozen prawns have rather less salt content than your cooked frozen prawns: don t ask me for the serial number but just read a bag of each. WHY are Tesco processed foods so full of salt? Bad diet is costing the NHS a bomb. Just google some of the salt information sites and see what I mean.;;;;;2016-05-13T08:30:36+0000;1463128236;2016-05-13 10:30:36;0;8;0;0;8;8;1;7;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Tonight  not only did I miss my delivery slot (I was in the gym  instead of being at home)  I also discovered that my food delivery was sent to my sister‚Äôs flat in Exeter instead of mine in London! The series of events started when the lovely gentleman called up saying that he‚Äôs outside my house. I panicked  realising I had forgotten and I was ten minutes away. He told me not to worry and that he will continue with the other deliveries  then for me to call him once home and he would come back to deliver my food. I was so taken by his kindness that on the way home that I bought some chocolates for him to say sorry. Once home I called him and he said he would be there in 3 minutes. I waited by my front door and then received a phone call. He told me he was outside. Puzzled  I explained I was also by my door. It wasn‚Äôt until he started reading out my sister‚Äôs address in Devon that I realised that not only was I late for my delivery  it was a delivery that for some reason was in Devon  not my address in London. I frantically apologised saying that it was my sister‚Äôs address. He told me not to worry and was happy to wait whilst I called her to check if she was in. Unfortunately  she wasn‚Äôt and I called back to explain. I apologised for messing things up  however  he kept telling me not to worry. I couldn‚Äôt believe just how understanding and kind he was. He then gave me help by telling me how to contact the customer services so that it could be rectified. Now I‚Äôm sitting here  with no food  except a box of chocolates meant for that lovely man. However  I‚Äôm overcome by how nice this Tesco employee was  and it‚Äôs given me a little faith in humanity. If we could all be as kind as him  the world would be a much nicer place. Thank you so very much to that incredibly nice man. Please can you try to reach this exceptional employee and thank him for me.;;;;;2016-05-12T21:51:19+0000;1463089879;2016-05-12 23:51:19;6;2;6;0;8;2;2;0;0;0;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

This left 4   manned   checkouts and 6 self service to deal with the entire store. It wasn t particularly busy but the queues were still 2 or 3 deep at the checkouts. Also Tesco is the only major supermarket not to offer cash back at the self service. Why is this?;;;;;2016-05-12T17:37:13+0000;1463074633;2016-05-12 19:37:13;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I purchased 6 whole rainbow trouts and kindly asked for them to be gutted  filleted and de-Scaled. The fishmonger said that they do not do this anymore- at which point I m surprised to hear as I am at the fresh fish counter and have purchased fish before which has been prepared as I have requested. Anyway I asked him again if he can at the very least descale the fish which he replied and said they already are. I come home with my kids expecting dinner  and open the fish bag to find all the fish have their scales  extra work on top of my finishing the school run  prepping dinner in my attempt to descale  gut and fillet all 6 fishes!

To which  June  then responded  with much attitude   Well  there are PLENTY of other checkouts open . Well  yes  there were - but I wanted to buy tobacco  as well as the box of cakes in my hand  which is only available from Tobacco counter. When my turn came  rather than an apology  I received more attitude about people  always paying for their cakes here .

Tesco Club card security is just hilarious  i m surprised Tesco has not sent me code card for it and a pin and a number of other security procedures.  How many points can you actually have on card to warrant this level of  security by obscurity .  My correspondence to date lists that i have a club card  yet i have never actually been sent one and they hash out a number of the digits on the correspondence (vouchers).  I called club card services on the phone about 3 weeks ago; the first guy found my account .   Rep:   yes sir we will send out a club card to you ..  3 weeks later.  Still no club card.  I rang today and she cant find my account   i said  can i give you a grocery order number of something  she said  sorry sir we can t see that information .

A young man who I guess was supervising the tills as he had an ear piece in can over and approached me and asked if I needed help packing while I settled the baby. I quickly accepted and he organised another young man to help me. This lad packed my whole shop while I fed the Baby a bottle and gave everyone s ears a rest!

This exemption only applies where the bag is less than 206mm (width) x 459mm (height including handles) with a maximum gusset of 125mm.

As I was putting the dummy away she offered to not only wash the dummy but sterilise it with water from a kettle. I thanked her again and told her not to worry as I had spares. I am so touched that one of your staff members went out if there way to help/accommodate me. I truly hope this member of staff gets the recognition she deserves.

I bought a Henry Hoover 2 weeks ago for ¬£109.00. I waited to see if the price went down for bank holiday weekend which it didn t. I have since found that Asda  the exact same Hoover for ¬£95.00! I have been back into store and asked for the different back. In my amazement your stores do not do price match on bigger items?!? Seriously? Isn t it in your best interest to do this and keep the money in your store takings?! I have since been on the online chat and have been advised that I can return the item and then purchase one from Asda !!! Then I asked about getting the cash back because I paid by card....(if I get a refund onto my card it s going to take 3-5 days to go on) and they have said no they can not do this. Now surely you want to retain the customer? I will be taking the Hoover back for a refund and will Definately think twice about purchasing big items from you again in the future!!!;;;;;2016-05-11T12:16:04+0000;1462968964;2016-05-11 14:16:04;0;5;0;0;5;5;4;1;7;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Just letting Tesco and tesco customers know that they introduced the new  Rosedene  fruit+veg in our local tesco s  Ystradgynlais swansea. But to my shock horror I went there yesterday only to find most of the fruit and veg were put up in price compared to a few weeks ago when they introduced this brand at being  affordable  to struggling customers......for instance the blueberries WERE 89p a small punnet  raspberries WERE ¬£1.09  strawberries WERE ¬£1.09 and blackberries WERE 89p. I can t recall what the price of all had been changed to but the blueberries  my sons favourite for his fruit break in school  are now ¬£1.09 per small punnet!!! Hence I didn t buy any and WON T until the price comes back down!!! Why has this happened Tesco??? Surely the whole point of getting this make into your store was to help struggling families so why put the prices up??? If the items are a good seller  which by the way they WERE  that surely doesn t give you the right to just up them in price. Defeating the objective of supplying fruit and veg at a reasonable price!!!!??? This SHOULD NOT be allowed to happen  if its an affordable brand then it should stay affordable NOT put up in price because it sells!

I am utterly disgusted  shocked and angry about comments made by a member of your staff to my friend s mother. The incident occurred in your Hucknall store and it was concerning the sexuality of Brandon  my friend.  My friends mother  who is a regular  long-standing customer of Tesco was approached by a member of your staff who she knows  only to be told  you should feel disappointed in your son turning out gay!   I am absolutely astounded that a member of your staff who work in a big corporation would openly air their views like this. She clearly thinks this is acceptable  much to her amazement  it s clearly not.  My friend felt like he was being judged  for simply being himself  as he is doing his weekly shop with mother.  I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest inconvenience  with a comprehensive list of the action you are going to take in to the investigation around this.

I wandered the aisles aimlessly looking for a remedy  and arguably more importantly I wanted to get some well deserved respite.  As a bloke I had to do the obligatory sweep past the magazines; taking a peek at car magazines. I then pondered  and considered buying an Xbox or a Playstation; finally deciding that I couldn t make my mind up. In reality  i was only kidding myself as I thought of carnage at home  if I had returned with either. I resigned to the fact that no matter how I explained it  or how I sold it. That it was a particularly bad idea  and I might as well have signed my own death warrant. Figuratively speaking.   Looking at the time I decided that I really should start searching for the remedy for an easy life  albeit in this case a cure for the missus s sore gullet. I spent the next 10 minutes trying to decide which flavour of cough sweets would best suit the boss  and I wisely chose the cherry flavour. I figured that if she didn t like them  then I would. Not all would be lost  I felt fairly smug about my perspicacious judgment in this matter. I proceeded to choose a cake with aplomb; lavishly picking up the luxury chocolate cake. I knew that this would cheer her up no end  and as a result of this  I would have a nag-free evening in front of the telly. At this point  I thought I would over indulge with the purchase of some luxury ice cream. I carefully selected the nicest looking clotted  cornish ice cream I could find. I walked almost merrily to the tills  avoiding the self serving robots as I was pleasantly greeted by the human sitting behind the desk. She smiled and I smiled back  as I packed my bag. I thank the lady and proceeded to the car. As I left it was raining moderately  but not enough to dampen my mood.  When I got home  I played my usual childish prank. Which was to pretend that there was no cake left at the shop; bizarrely this seems to amuse me. Telling her that she will have to cherry cough sweets and ice cream for her throat  and nothing else. After a few moments  I showed her the cake. She was shocked to see that i had spent a considerably higher amount more than I usually would do on her. She was very keen for me to dish up the cake.   Now this is the single  most important part of this utterly dull and otherwise pointless story. I opened the polythene packet  and to my disgust the cake was extremely badly packaged. Enough for me to consider my chances of success. The cake was surrounded by cardboard and the bottom of the cake was covered by some sort of paper. Before I was able to plan the best course of the action  the cake was splatted on the floor. The same floor that she had spent mopping only earlier today!   What I did next Tesco  was not my proudest moment. Using the card  you so kindly provided I proceeded to scoop the cake into a bowl. I briefly checked for hairs  but concluded that it should be safe as she had cleaned the aforementioned kitchen tiles this morning. I then piled the ice cream on top  as if to hide any foreign bodies that might lurk on top of the luxury chocolate treat.   When I went into the living room  my partner who was clearly surprised by my lack of food asked  where s yours? . She was even more surprised when I replied that I didn t fancy any  but gladly she was over the moon when I informed her that their was plenty left in the fridge.   So when she went for seconds  and almost slipped in the chocolaty mush that consumed the kitchen floor. Lets just say that I didn t get the blissfully calm and relaxing evening that I had hoped for. In addition to that  the missus still has a sore throat from all the shouting she did.  I write today in relation to the packaging for this product; I feel that it is not satisfactory. In my opinion  opening a box and slicing a sweet treat  should be in theory be no more or less than  a piece of cake .  I look forward to receiving your reply  Matt";;;;;2016-05-10T23:41:17+0000;1462923677;2016-05-11 01:41:17;5;2;7;0;9;2;2;0;0;0;4;0;0;2;0;0;0

I was not happy with that explanation as i have never paid this before  there is no advice on the website at the time of payment  nor can i find anything in your terms and conditions regarding this. I asked to speak to her manager  she initially refused but after several minutes of arguing agreed that he would call me back. I expressed my dissatisfaction regarding this matter when he bluntly told me  thats what we always do . Oddly these ¬£2 transactions do not show on my bank account??? He kept taking over the top of me in an extremely arrogant manner which led me to shout back at him  her terminated the call. If that man worked for my company  speaking to my customers in that fashion  he would in the morning be down the job centre. So  apart from this never having happened on my account before i also wonder why the payment for the delivery has already been processed but the ¬£2 transaction still is pending  it should have been completed and refunded at the same time as payment was taken  or the ¬£2 could have been deducted from the final balance!;;;;;2016-05-10T20:38:21+0000;1462912701;2016-05-10 22:38:21;1;6;1;0;7;6;5;1;3;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I don t believe that is correct as the contract is between Tesco the seller and my daughter the buyer and any faults regardless of what sony has in place Tesco has a responsibility to make it good through repair in reasonable time.

I got a weeks worth of food that went out of date today and tomorrow !! I know have no way to get to a shop as I live in middle of nowhere with no shops at all . I don t drive and there is no public transport and registered disabled in a lot of pain  . I have a 1 year old daughter I cannot feed as I ve had to send the food back . The refund for the food and the good will gesture amount to nothing as I cannot make another order without spending ¬£40 to get it ! I am not you dustbin ! How am I meant to feed my daughter ?!! Let alone myself . I even wrote on the notes of my order   no short dates   I should not have to come into store to make sure I get food that is in date . I should not be subjected to your pickers finding the stock that is going out of date and giving it to me so you don t loose money and I do instead . It s hard enough being a disabled mother and looking after myself and my daughter without you making it harder by going out of your way to send out of date food . The dates that where written on the receipt didn t even match the dates on the food . The receipt said the 11-13th yet half went out today and bare in mind I have recieved my order at 8pm the rest went out tomorrow . The bits I ve had to keep to feed my daughter go out of date by the 13th . This was meant to be a weeks shop . On the food I picked it had 4+ days or so on stating these products would last . Yet I receive the stock that should have been binned today or reduced for those who don t mind to pick up . You should not advertise that it has a set amount of days before it goes out on your page and not stick to it . You should not use deliveries as a way to get rid of out of date   short date stock . There are many people like me who depend on this service to have food in there homes as live in remote areas . The closest thing to me is a garage ! They do not even sell food let alone food I could feed my daughter . This is not the first time either ! It is the third !!! The first time I accepted a refund for the out of date product   then for a while things where fine . The second time I was given a refund for the product and then the ¬£40 voucher to make up for the trouble you caused and so I could feed my daughter . Then again after things where fine until again it has been repeated . It was in the news recently how this was being done and it was not acceptable yet you have continued to do so ! I have bought things that where in date date wise yet still off . This is not acceptable;;;;;2016-05-10T19:50:55+0000;1462909855;2016-05-10 21:50:55;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Panicking that my car wouldn t get any further I managed to get to the Tesco in Cardigan (car was now jittering!) but my card did not work for Pay at Pump. I went into the store to find help and Mags Lawson and Olwen Davies behind the Customer Service Desk were excellent. Mags offered to ring her husband for him to take me the rest of the journey and Olwen called the duty manager  Sarah Morgan to see what help they could give as I was stranded. I was able to get cash back in the store and Olwen walked over to the PFS with me and used her own card to fill up my fuel and I gave her the cash. I am a manager with Tesco and it made me proud when I was offered so much help from these very lovely ladies. I hope that all 3 of them can be given a values award for the excellent and professional service which they gave me and also calmed me down.

I d like to ask if anyone who works at that store or the ones in charge of trolly maintenance has ever had to push a disabled 5 year old who almost constantly rocks back in forth and flails about in a half working trolly? The straps to buckle him in were frayed and broken! I couldn t even secure him in. The wheels were next to useless as any hope of turning the trolly was near impossible. Parts of the padded seat were torn open. It was a mess pretty much. I had no hope of putting him in a regular trolly as he is too large.  I was so happy to see these trollies become available to Tesco shoppers but sadly today that happiness was ruined as well as the shopping trip.  I appreciate that wear and tear is unavoidable but the state this one trolly is left in is deplorable. It s the ONLY disabled children s trolly in this shop and sadly you have failed anyone who is needing to use it. You have done your part to provide it but clearly the customer service doesn t go beyond that.;;;;;2016-05-10T15:50:06+0000;1462895406;2016-05-10 17:50:06;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I bought some swimwear from your store in Banchory a few days ago. I took it home to try on as there are no changing rooms in store. Unfortunately  it didn t fit  so I decided to return it  only to be told that I was unable to return it due to  a change in policy . As I understand it  you no longer accept returns on swimwear. I was careful not to remove the hygiene label from inside the swimwear as  on the label  it clearly states that refunds will not be given if removed. This is clearly a contradiction to your new policy as you now won t accept returns full stop. I pointed this out to customer services who politely agreed with me  and further  when I stated that there were no signs informing me of this new policy anywhere in store  they hesitantly agreed. I had to go to great lengths to get a refund (which was reluctantly agreed to) and i m really quite irritated by this. I really love Tesco clothing  but this has really disappointed me. How many people have accepted this new policy  and are left feeling ripped off? I spent ¬£16 on swimwear which I couldn t try on  only to be told there was  nothing they could do  when I asked for a refund. An exchange was also out of the question. I notice that this isn t clearly stated on your website either  but I don t know whether this is due to distance selling or not. Sort it out  Tesco!

Last week I was called  to arrange a delivery.  The arranged day was today  Monday 9th May. I was told I would receive a call on Friday with a three hour time slot.  I did receive a call from an automated system on Friday however on answering the phone the time slot was not legible and there was no option to repeat the message. I then called customer services on Saturday to find out the delivery slot   I was told they would contact the courier and call me back.  Noone called back. I called again this morning and was told my delivery slot was 1500-1800 today.  At 1830 I phoned again as my drier had still not arrived. I was told that they didn t know why my drier had not arrived and they couldn t get hold of the courier so there was nothing they Could do except e mail the courier and wait for them to contact me.  So as it stands tesco have ¬£450.00 of my money   I have not received my drier and have no idea where it is our when it will arrive and you have now left it up to the courier despite having taken my money!  I took a day off work today   I can t take another day off so what am I meant to do now? After being letdown by hotpoint with my previous dryer I decided to order through tesco instead as I have always been a loyal customer.

For some reason the management of this store like to keep these checkouts closed (probably because they want to force people to use self-service checkouts).  The store is so badly designed  that if you enter one end and want to exit the other  you have to walk half way in the opposite direction of the exit you want  to reach a checkout. The store itself is a disaster when it comes to the layout  it was refurbished and all the aisles made narrower  apart from the freezer aisle which is double the width of the other aisles.  For some reason people always seem to stop for a chat by the fresh bread  so there is normally a blockage of people  pushchairs and trolleys.  The stock on the fresh bread is often quite empty  you can see the bread  cakes and rolls waiting to be put on display and I now go into the bakery and ask for what I want. Perhaps less freebie weekends away for the management and more staff could be the answer.;;;;;2016-05-09T19:24:38+0000;1462821878;2016-05-09 21:24:38;2;3;2;0;5;3;1;2;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have kept the pack of crisps  and the main packaging and can provide this to you if required and drop it off at my local store.  I also would like to raise an issue with these crisps. I go through a number of these packs each week which I purchase from your East Dereham store. Over the last 18 months I have often come across packs that have split open which cannot be eaten. I have seen the way they are put on the shelf and the staff just push them onto the shelf without taking much care  thus causing split packs. Can this please be addressed at this store as over the last 18 months I have thrown away well over 100+ packs of crisps due to them being split open. Many thanks.;;;;;2016-05-09T15:39:29+0000;1462808369;2016-05-09 17:39:29;1;2;1;0;3;2;1;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

In Haydock as I struggled to the checkout with my very unhappy two month old daughter  a member of staff very helpfully insisted upon unloading  scanning and packing my shopping for me and was incredibly friendly.   In Prescot  after another costumer rudely shouting and hammering on the door of the baby changing room while I was trying to feed my baby (making me have to stop as it made me and my daughter very anxious)  a staff member in the opticians where I had my appointment offered me the examination room to feed my baby in private and made sure we were not interrupted. She also made sure my baby was ok while I had my eye test.   These simple yet kind gestures mean so much to a new mum who is still trying to figure out how to manage appointments and shopping with a baby. It makes the experience so much easier and I m very grateful that tesco staff are so kind and helpful.;;;;;2016-05-09T14:50:50+0000;1462805450;2016-05-09 16:50:50;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I followed the lady into the store so I just thought I best tell her  maybe they didn t realise what they d done (easily done I suppose)  so I actually said  not sure if you ve noticed but you ve parked in a parent and child space   her reply was  well when you ve got bad legs you park were you can ... My reply  oh I see  well I have a heavy car seat with a baby  I ll be sure to take a disabled spot next time I m here  her reply  you can get done for that  ... My reply   oh ok I best not then... You know there are spaces outside that are located closer than the space you re in now ?.... I wonder if they re worried about scratching their New VW Golf (2016 reg)... If you re concerned about her legs  don t worry she managed to walk into the store completely unaided  no limp or anything... So that s good news....üòÄ I made the couple aware that I d told customer services about their parking error and they said  Good .... So they were happy about that üòÄ Delightful couple üòÄ  I m not a moaner but it really hacks me off  when I visit the store child free (this is rare lol) I park in a normal space to free up the others for families that need them....

First the tension rod for the enclosure snapped and then the pole caps for the enclosure snapped. When I returned to store I discovered I should have had a spare parts bag in my box containing another pole cap but I don t seem too. It has made me concerned that whilst my children are playing on it something else will snap ! The store I bought from were very helpful and reissuing parts from other boxes but it took us over 2 days to get the thing together because we had to return to the store we bought it from not once but twice ! We now might as well have spent the extra money on a larger trampoline as we have had to use fuel to travel back to your store twice !;;;;;2016-05-09T09:25:20+0000;1462785920;2016-05-09 11:25:20;0;4;0;0;4;4;1;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

After having no correspondence from yourself or the delivery company I phoned up to be told that there is nothing they can do and that it is with yodel. I have phoned up yodel to be told that tesco have given them a delivery date of Wednesday. Really bad customer service from your advisor who couldn t get off the phone quick enough. If I had known the parcel wouldn t have come before my daughters birthday I would have ordered else where.

At the selfservice checkout I asked for a single use bag. I didn t enter the bag at the end of the transaction as the law in Northern Ireland states that charges do not apply when purchasing raw meat  prepacked or otherwise  raw fish  hot food takeaway and medicial supplies. As I was leaving the checkout a member of staff pounced on me for now paying for the bag. I explained the excemption to the law but he stated he was not aware of this. He went to another member of staff who also stated she was not aware of this exception. So I stood there while your staff debated a 5p charge. I was made to feel like I was trying to steal a bag and avoid a 5p charge. you need to make your staff aware of the law to prevent them making mistakes that cause your customers embarrassment. It s a shame your staff have so little to do. Should this happen to me again I will take the matter to your CEO.;;;;;2016-05-09T09:05:38+0000;1462784738;2016-05-09 11:05:38;1;4;1;0;5;4;3;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

When  it arrived two of the parts were missing and two were damaged. Following the instructions in the box I ordered spare parts direct from Keter. The courier couldn t find my house so the parts were out for delivery for over a week with a delivery estimation time of between 8am and 7pm each time. I realise this part doesn t involve tesco.  However when I opened the package of spares...guess what... two of the parts were broken and two of the parts were missing. The broken parts were also filthy and looked second hand.  I m not waiting around again for days on end for  a redelivery. This thing was expensive.  I want a refund from tesco. The parts should ve been in the box to begin with and I m not paying to return the item because none of this was my fault. Had the item been in tact and all parts there i would ve kept it.  Please advise how I can get a refund without paying for delivery. It s not feasible for me to get this to a store either  hence why I had it delivered to begin with.

It s lovely being woken up by one of your delivery drivers at 7.15 on a Sunday morning when you re hoping for a lie in on a day of rest. My neighbours normally get their delivery at this time  I am well aware of this fact  but this morning whomever was driving van KY64UVZ  Chatham  Kent needs to be spoken to about early morning etiquette.   I didn t hear anything until a massive bang which startled me  it was followed shortly after by another crash  it turns out he had gotten one tray of goods out and thrown it on his metal trolley and then another out and thrown that on top. He proceeded to do this for all of the delivery throwing the plastic trays around slamming them on the concrete and on top of each other (which needless to say probably didn t do the food much good). This was then shortly followed by him shutting the back door which seemed like he was trying to do it as loudly as he could and him bringing down the sliding door of his van as if he were trying to break it off its hinges. I know it s possible to close it in a quieter manner  after all I never normally get woken by it. After all this was finished everything was slung back in to his van with another massive clatter and the doors shut in the same manner before he drove away. Thanks for being my alarm clock and getting me ready to face the day  after all Every Little Helps!;;;;;2016-05-08T06:37:36+0000;1462689456;2016-05-08 08:37:36;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Yet again I failed to check out the use by dates on my meat purchases and discover that 2 of the 3 tesco meat products go out of date tomorrow !!! This is the case with 75% of the time and you shouldn t have to check the bbd on your purchases and it s down to alot of things starting with poor stock control and using the dated attitude that they will loose a sale because if it s not in Stock people won t choose something else which isn t true and leads to massive waste when it doesn t sell. When you shop at the other places like lidl iceland farmfoods and aldi ect you don t have the same problem and it s because people aren t viewing them as a cheap and nasty alternative anymore because the quality of products is equally as good and their policies are becoming better than yours are.

He was at Prevail skatehouse this morning  where my son s friend got injured  by his scooter taking a rather large chunk out of the side of his leg. Matt showed enormous maturity for a 17 year old  and dealt with the situation so well. It was quite traumatic for my son s friend  and Matt kept him calm during the whole time and even took his own time to go to the hospital with him. He then made sure that he left the hospital on time to ensure he got to work at Tesco s in Poole after this eventful morning - all the staff have a duty of care for their customers  but Matt went above and beyond this today. He was so caring  kind and thoughtful  it would be great for him to be recognised for his efforts today  as I know that he values his job at Tesco and wishes to progress up the career ladder. I would like to say a big thank you to him  he really deserves to do well.;;;;;2016-05-07T20:34:29+0000;1462653269;2016-05-07 22:34:29;9;2;9;0;11;2;1;1;0;0;9;0;0;0;0;0;0

I would like to publicly request that you either a) increase the number of double seated trolleys that you have available or b) require a pound to be inserted to release them in Tesco Bradley Stoke  Bristol.   I have a three year old partially sighted autistic son and a one year old daughter and near enough every time I go to Tesco I have to wait 10-15 mins at customer service while the kind hearted staff trawl the car park looking for a double seated trolley for me. It s either that or carry both my children around the car park myself along with my bags while I look for one myself.   My son is unable to walk around Tesco while I do a full food shop for our family of six and my daughter is too old for the lie back version seat  so it s impossible for me to shop without a double seated trolley.   Customer services tell me because these trolleys are free (they don t require a pound to release them)  people use them frequently when they don t have a pound then leave them in the car park trolley bays. As there is not many of them there are hardly ever any at all in either of the shop front trolley bays. I would happily put a pound in if it meant the trolleys would be available.   I urge other parents with more than one young child from Bradley Stoke and the surrounding areas to back me on this request please! There are loads of trolleys with one seat  and loads of trolleys with a reclined baby seat and a toddler seat but only a handful with double toddler seats.   I note that Tesco in Crawley has also introduced trolleys with child seats for older children with difficulties such as autism. Perhaps you could consider this too?  Please note that I do greatly appreciate the efforts of the staff in Tesco Bradley Stoke as they are always sympathetic and tremendously helpful.   Thank you so much for your time.;;;;;2016-05-07T19:16:42+0000;1462648602;2016-05-07 21:16:42;67;29;68;9;106;29;15;14;22;0;67;1;0;0;0;0;0

I m ashamed and mortified to say that I lost my son in store there this evening (around 5:45pm ish)  -  I let him go to the men s toilets whilst I took his little sister the the girls  rightly or wrongly going to the mens is something I let him do whenever he needs to use the toilet - he normally waits for me outside - today for some reason  he didn t. He panicked   thought the store was closing and that he would be trapped inside and left - before I had gotten out of the toilet with his sister. Unknown to me at the time he had found his way back to the car   as he though that was the safest thing to do. I just wanted to give all the staff that helped me a MASSIVE THANKS ! Two ladies in purple t-shirts who were by the toilets saw me frantically shouting for my son in the mens toilets called for help and instantly a mass off staff came from all over the store - some stood by the front door to make sure he wasn t going to wonder out with a stranger - and loads we re looking all over the store. The two guys that stood with me by the front door kept me together with their jolly personalities and reassurance that my boy would be found - if they hadn t have been so smiley and jolly and totally calm i would have had a nervous breakdown - EVERYONE was amazing - I can t believe how fast they all arrived and how quickly they got themselves organised to look for him ... I don t really want to be publicly stating that I lost my son today   but I noticed there are lots of complaints posted and not many post of positivity and praise . My son was fine and as I said he managed to safety find his way back to the car - if I d have alerted staff sooner   he wouldn t have made it out the door. They clearly have a brilliant missing / lost child policy - I didn t get anyones name as I was in a mass of panic but please do pass my thanks on to the store for finding my spider man (he had his costume on) .

I moved into The Cube in Birmingham a few weeks ago. My local shop I like to frequent daily is Tesco Express at The Mailbox. Yesterday I went shopping with my boyfriend to get chicken for his dinner. There were several different varieties of chicken.. However  perplexed  we tried to find the Free Range option. We couldn t find the free range chicken but I earnestly asked an employee to direct us to the Free Range chicken. He responded that the store didn t stock free range chicken. I was totally horrified. I want to be able to exercise my right to purchase cruelty-free chicken. Rather than hundreds of people being forced into buying an item that endorses cruelty and gives an incorrect view of people s moral standing.  It is worth mentioning that this particular Tesco is in a highly affluent area and I am confident many of the residents would want to choose cruelty-free for a higher price. We of course didn t buy the chicken. I would like to be able to buy free range chicken from my local Tesco.

The first aider arrived with a manager to check to make sure my son was ok. They ended up phoning an ambulance as it was a head injury and wanted to be on the safe side.

I would like to thank the lady who works the night shift supervising the self checkout tills in your Cardington Road store in Bedford. I ve been having a dreadful time with my property over the last few weeks. I stopped eating evening meals as I cannot eat or drink in my home as the kitchen is not safe to use and the whole house smells of raw sewerage. I didn t eat evening meals for 4 weeks and lost a stone in weight. I started bulling myself into buying sandwich from Tesco very late at night and eating it in my car as I knew if I took it home with me I would throw it away due to the smell of sewerage always lingering.  On the night of April 18th  I arrived at Tesco and wondered around for half an hour trying to convince myself to eat something. It was 23:45 at night and all I had eaten all day was a mouthful of flapjack. Every time I thought about eating I would wretch as I had the smell of sewerage in my mind even though I wasn t at home to physically smell it. After half an hour of pacing the store up and down  I settled unhappily on a chicken Caesar wrap. I did not want to eat it in my car  in the car park  like a sad loner. So I approached the lady who was supervising the self checkouts and I explained the situation at home briefly and asked if I could possibly eat my sandwich in the corner of the closed cafe. She smiled and said   no problem . She made my day! My week and my month!  Since that evening in the Tesco closed cafe eating a sandwich by myself  I have made sure I have continued to eat every evening. I work much later than I should and eat at the office just before I set off home.  I m meant to finish work at 6pm but I ve often remained at work until after 11pm just to avoid going home. I spent over ¬£100K on a building contractor who was supposed to renovate my home. Instead it feels like he has destroyed it and he s left it in a very bad condition.  Tonight I worked unnecessarily late again to avoid going home. I ve just been into the Cardington Road store and the same lady who worked on the 18th April is there again. I ve just approached her as I was buying a sandwich to ask if her manager was on duty as I wanted to pass to let them know how much her kindness a couple of weeks ago meant to me. She said it wasn t necessary as it was nothing.  It wasn t nothing to me. Monday 18th April was the lowest day in my 43yr life. I m such an upbeat  positive thinking  go-getter  that I never would have imagined I could ever feel that low.  I made a promise to myself that night that I would never  ever eat alone at midnight in a closed Tesco cafe again. Life has to be better than that... surely.  I don t know the name of the lady who helped me on the 18th - the lady who thought what she did for me was nothing. To her it was nothing  to me it was everything and I hope you can pass on my thanks and reward her with praise.  Tonight I m eating my Tesco sandwich in my car but I m not in tears this time  I m feeling quite positive as it goes.  My house is still a bomb site and will be for a good while yet. Thank god you have two 24hr Tesco stores in Bedford.

I know this has been brought to your attention before  so could I implore you to please  please review your selection of rabbit food in your stores. You must be aware by now that sweetcorn kills rabbits. The husks can cause an obstruction in the gut. Unlike cats or dogs  you can t just open up a rabbit s gut to remove an obstruction as the risk of peritonitis is too high. On top of the the aforementioned risk  stasis sets in quickly. Stasis in rabbits results in death within 48 hours.  So why on earth do you still have sweetcorn on your shelves  marketed for rabbits  specifically  when you have been made aware of the risks? If you are unsure  please contact the Rabbit Welfare Association for further information.

Upon being asked to provide proof of age  I happily obliged providing three separate  valid  hologrammed Canadian government pieces of identification. The rude cashier said those were unacceptable and that I am required to show a passport. I asked to speak to her superior  and again was told the same. As I live and work in Dublin  I obviously under no circumstance carry my passport around on a day to day basis.   While I understand this may be an overly cautious company policy to prevent the sale of alcohol to minors  I most certainly do not appreciate being humiliated and angered at till point on a busy Friday evening after work. I m a professional 25 year old woman  who was dressed in office attire trying to purchase a bottle of champagne to celebrate a personal family achievement.   Not only did this ruin my evening after a busy work week  it has also severely dampened the celebratory mood for my husband and I.   Please note that in light of the above events I will permanently cease to frequent Tesco Jervis Street  and will strongly encourage my Dublin City Centre based office to follow suit.   I will note that the young blonde lady supervising was apologetic and polite  however the robust brunette cashier should have further etiquette/customer service training.   I am immensely thankful that there is an M&S just upstairs from your store where I was able to purchase champagne without issue.   I expect a response from a company customer service advisor in a timely manner.   Regards  Tena Doherty;;;;;2016-05-06T19:30:37+0000;1462563037;2016-05-06 21:30:37;1;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

On another point entirely  the delivery times for your store 7 am onwards  why are lorries parked up behind our fences from 5am to deliver to your store  again when we have gone into the store to complain we are aggressively told   we don t have delivers before 7am) your morning staff should be sent on customer service course  if we complain to to you   you send an e mail to the store and is shared around the staff who then make it impossible to shop in your store  I prefer to drive a few miles to get my paper than go into Dobbins place Tesco and believe me I m not the only one. When will this generator be taken away?

Last night was the first time Tesco ever had the quiet hours for people with Autism and other sensory needs. So I went up to see if it made a difference.It was so much nicer to shop in.I seen some people that I know who have kids with special needs and we smiled at each other and went on our way. On the escalator going down I heard the woman behind me say to her son was it nicer shopping when it was like this.Im not shy so I asked her how it was going and she said it was great. She wouldn t normally bring her young lad shopping . Now that made my day . It made me feel happy that this young lad could go and pick out his Spider-Man outfit without becoming distressed .For his mam to be able to hold his hand and talk about what you was good or what shoes where nice. Shopping for anyone can be a nightmear for kids with special needs it can be really difficult and for their parents and careers it can be a lonely traumatic Expriance.Last night it wasn t. So saying Thank you To all the Tesco staff   Lisa Mcevoy and Damien the MD doesn t really explain how I feel.The words included and valued and matters and belonging all spin to mind. Lisa had the feedback sheets at the customer service desk in Balbriggan .Please please fill them in. Thanks everyone.

I d like to say thank you to Ashley of your  extra  store in Salford. At least I think that was his name (young chap with a shaved head  working on customer service this evening). I went in looking to buy a pen used to detect fake banknotes as I was selling my car for cash and didn t want to take any chances and get lumbered with any fake notes. Ashley told me that the store didn t stock these items but once I explained my situation he very kindly offered to lend me one of the store s own pens used at tills so that I could check the money whilst selling my car.  A small gesture I know lending me a pen  but he didn t have to do that and by doing it he helped me out with something non-tesco related which was much appreciated. Needless to say I have returned the pen following the sale of the car! Using it put my mind at ease. He even explained to me what would happen should I come across any fake notes.

Was asked to check entire order against original as it was ¬£70 more than expected. Took 45 minutes to pull apart all bags  tick off against my original  and put in car. So so unimpressed.

I bought two ¬£25 visa gift cards at Southampton branch for Mothers Day gifts for my mum and mother-in-law. The cashier scanned the cards and charged me for them but when my mum and mother-in-law tried to redeem them they discovered they had not activated  even though I had paid for them. I no longer had my receipt as I was unaware they were not activated and thought they already been spent my mum. I decided to go back to Tesco to have a look at the gift cards and found out there is a strip on the back of the card that has to be removed and scanned to activate. I picked up two more to replace the previous ones and when I went through the checkout the cashier did the same thing again! They scanned the small barcode at the top of the packet  I told them the packet says to remove the panel and use that barcode to activate it. The cashier and supervisor were unaware that if the panel was not removed and the small barcode was scanned then the customer is charged for a card that is not activated!! Very annoyed that I ve now spent ¬£105.90 to get two ¬£25 gift cards. ( 2 x ¬£25 for two unactivated cards and 2 x ¬£27.95 for two activated cards (yes you get charged ¬£2.95 for activating each card!!)) Tesco needs to train their cashiers how to process gift cards properly.;;;;;2016-05-05T18:32:09+0000;1462473129;2016-05-05 20:32:09;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

After various investigations and mounting costs from a few garages a test was carried out on the fuel itself and finally a diagnosis of the fuel is what caused my car to stop running perfectly. I have had the tank drained and the car is now back on the road. However I contacted Tesco today and they are denying that there was any issues with their fuel in South Wigston on the 3rd of April 2016!!!! Interestingly I went to see the duty Manager last night (Milissa) who confirmed they had indeed had several cases of fuel contamination and apologised etc explaining that they did try to contact as many vehicles as possble through number plate recognition but could only reach so many (me not being one of them). I told her that they should have done more to try and solve the problem by putting large notices on the petrol station forecourt and in store saying they had a problem so that customers could come forward! Anyway I also went to speak to Tony in the petrol station counter point and he said he was sorry  that he recalls serving me that day and me going back to ask him if there was an issue with the fuel and he said I was the first customer that came back that day so at that point he did not know there was an issue but that many cars after me came back to and were all referred to Head Office. The famous Head Office have responded by saying they have had no reports at all from South Wigston petrol station! I am appealing for anyone who has any information to message me please - anything at all ... do you know of any fuel contamination at Tesco recently. do you know anyone this has happened to and do you know if Tesco have admitted it? Please help - thank you. I intend to take this to the Small Claims Court so need all the help I can get as my costs incurred to date are over ¬£2000 so I cannot let it go.

What I actually did after school was pick up my equally hot and bothered children  who outdid themselves by throwing some  stroppy  an irrational  into the mix and drove them to Tesco Express  Silva Island Way  Wickford to use the photo booth so that we may apply for their passports.   At this stage  I need to stress that the booth is INSIDE Tesco. So I queue up  and cheerily asked the cashier if she could change the two ¬£10 notes so that I may use the photo booth (it is still INSIDE Tesco) and was told that they were not allowed to give change for the photo booth (the booth that is INSIDE Tesco). My shoulders drop  dismayed at this I wearily ask what the cheapest thing is that I can buy and proceed to purchase a pack of unwanted gum just for an easy solution. The cashier processes the transaction and hands me my change.....which consist of 8 ¬£2 coins and some small change. Now  I already know that the booth takes either a ¬£5.00 note or a combination of two ¬£2 coins and a ¬£1 coin (using the exact money only)  however the change that the (now smirking) cashier hands me (as she slams the till drawer closed) does not contain any combination of the correct coins or notes. She simply grins and says  Well  you asked for change .  So we repeat the entire exercise with another ¬£10 note and I am now 2 unwanted packets of chewing gum better off with the urge to jump over the counter and shove both packets into the cashiers smug face. Needless to say  I didn t  although she was left in no doubt about my feelings towards her actions.   I am now at home drinking wine  I have avoided the junk food so far  I am fairly certain that Channing Tatum is not coming  but I have my pictures  my health and I was not arrested for assault today....all in all  today was a good day.;;;;;2016-05-05T17:19:26+0000;1462468766;2016-05-05 19:19:26;4;2;4;0;6;2;2;0;2;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

I took a tv/dvd combi in to the store that is faulty and will no longer play dvds. After explaining the situation to a staff member at the customer service desk I was immediately put onto a telephone with barley an explanation   with no acknowledgment of my issue  in fact your member of staff hardly made eye contact with me let alone showed any empathy or sympathy.   The member of staff I then spoke to on the phone proceeded to take 10 minutes asking endless  and mostly irrelevant  questions only to tell me that I would have to contact Toshiba (the manufactor) myself.  After explaining that this was not helpful to me as my contract is with Tesco as the retailer who sold me the item   which was under 12 months old  I requested to speak to a manager in the store from your member of staff I had originally spoken to.   Again  with no explanation she walked to the telephone at the other side of the counter  turned her back to me and spoke in a low voice into the phone  obviously explaining to your manager her version of what had happened.   Your customer service manager came across a few minutes later.  Again I received no sympathy or empathy to my situation  she barely acknowledged it and had clearly pre empted what she was going to say after her discussion on the phone.   I found her rude and unsympathetic to my issue and began a conversation with regards something that had happened to her which was irrelevant  with no apology for my situation or seeming to care. She flatly refused to help remedy the reason that I was in your store and even implied that I should be grateful that I had had 11 months use of the tv.   I left feeling totally humiliated that this was conducted in front of other customers and members of staff who were watching and listening and I do not feel as though I received any kind of customer service at all. Not what I would expect from a large company as yours with such a good reputation.   I told your manager that I would take the matter further which was received with a smirk  and I left feeling totally under valued as a loyal customer of yours.   I will not be shopping at your company any more   and I am totally frustrated at the attitude I received from your staff. Not one of them took ownership  all three of them passed me on with no consideration whatsoever.   I appreciate that you may have policies (although I am certain many other large companies would have refunded me with no question for a tv/dvd worth around ¬£100)  but I was made to feel through your staff s questioning that it was somehow my fault and my problem that it had broken after such a short time.;;;;;2016-05-05T14:02:22+0000;1462456942;2016-05-05 16:02:22;0;24;1;0;25;24;7;17;6;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

I was told by a lady at a different shop that they sell it in tesco. Also 2 for 4 pound. I couldn t find it so asked a member of staff who showed me but the shelf was empty. She then told me to go to customer services for them to call another member of staff to check if there was any out the back. . I can t thank the gentlemen enough Who was on customer services. Who sorted it out for me. Also the man who went out the back and got it for me.I had my 2 year old with me and I bought 2 bags of sand which was pretty heavy to pick up with one hand and hold my little boys hand. So then the gentlemen on customer services carried the sand to my car for me. Which he didn t have to do.

Staff who have worked for the company since before 1999 will have their Sunday premiums cut from double time to time and a half. Some night Workers who are contracted to Saturday and Sunday nights are set to lose thousands of pounds a year. Cutting of night premium 1 will impact on all twilight workers who currently work between 10pm and midnight costing them between ¬£1.50-¬£3 a day. It will also mean a reduction of 79p a night for all night workers. Giving a 3.1% pay rise to some staff  1.6% to night workers and a pay cut to other members of staff is not  fair . Tesco openly admit the cuts to long standing colleagues pay is helping to fund an across the board  pay rise . But for many staff it s a pay cut. The reduction/cutting of location pay is also going to impact many staff  some who work in areas where the cost of living is already extremely high. Offering a one off  transition  payment of 18 months worth of the difference is not good enough. People have made financial commitments based on their take home wages  now they are having them cut they will find themselves in serious financial difficulty. Tesco should not be allowed to take money out of people s every day wages to fund a pay rise for  some  colleagues. If they have to reduce wages then it should be done over a longer period of time  giving colleagues 5 months notice that they will be thousands of pounds a year worse off is quite frankly disgraceful.;;;;;2016-05-04T12:07:49+0000;1462363669;2016-05-04 14:07:49;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was extremely happy to discover there would be a caterpillar cake on sale  however each slice/portion is 50% of your daily sugar which is double that of the ordinary caterpillar cake - this is unreasonably high and unnecessary.   I was also disappointed to find that it is nothing like the normal caterpillar cake. It is not a Swiss roll and instead of a chocolate coating has a very thick layer of icing (just changing this would dramatically reduce the sugar content I feel)  I also feel that as this cake is aimed at children who have to put up with little choice when it comes to cake  sugar content should be far lower.;;;;;2016-05-03T17:44:54+0000;1462297494;2016-05-03 19:44:54;0;4;0;0;4;4;3;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

As I m a 33year old woman who wasn t allowed to buy alcohol in one of your tesco express shops on Friday past  as I had no ID with me  I was told by the till operator it was policy to ask yet the gentleman at the next till wasn t asked. I find it a bit odd that myself and my friend were singled out as we clearly look over the age of 18. My friend who happened to have her driving licence with her also was not allowed to get served because I had none and I was with her. I then had to get my dad out of his car to come in and purchase the alcohol for me for a family celebration that had been organised. I would understand it if I looked under age but I m a grown woman that apparently looked under 18 to this lady. I look forward to your response as I m still a bit miffed by it all.

I arrived at your widnes store today to print out my sisters wedding pictures as their gift from myself. I got to the photo centre at 4.40pm to find that there was a glorious red ribbon blocking my path! I went to the customer service and asked the lady who said it should be open until 6pm but the woman who is trained in operating a till and printer might be on her break. I was stood waiting until 5 past 5 when finally a member of staff said they will go to the canteen and find her. 3 members of staff and 15 minutes later we come to the conclusion that she has closed up early for the day and has gone to enjoy the British summer. I now have a late wedding present that is even later and sore legs from standing around (luckily there was some empty shelving to lean on and a kids piano which I played a beautiful rendition of Titanic on to pass some time) back to the point maybe some clearer signage for your opening hours and more trained staff on that department. Luckily the Asda round the corner has a photo centre that s open until 8pm tonight. Thanks for reading!;;;;;2016-05-02T16:32:16+0000;1462206736;2016-05-02 18:32:16;20;4;20;0;24;4;2;2;1;0;19;0;0;0;0;0;0

Yesterday  I wasn t feeling too great so we decided to go to the cafe in the Kilmarnock branch. I needed a sit down and a drink  I was feeling very lightheaded. I ordered a drink and picked up prepackaged pancakes. My partner and kids all had a drink and a cake too. I opened my pancakes and put butter on the first one  took a bite and it was raw on the inside. My partner took them up to the counter to ask if I could swap or get my money back and the lady at the till said that s how they re meant to be and they come to the store that way. So  I m guessing that means I have to take them home and finish cooking them myself?  Anyway  we were refused our money back and I never got any kind of offer of a replacement.

I am very disappointed with Tesco as I have been a loyal customer for years.;;;;;2016-05-01T12:52:03+0000;1462107123;2016-05-01 14:52:03;1;2;1;0;3;2;1;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

There is major congestion problem in store with staff and their  Tesco Tractors .  You have staff parking these Tesco Tractors three deep and blocking access to produce all over the store.  You may be getting business from customers too lazy to shop for themselves but its extremely aggravating when staff have absolutely no consideration for in store shoppers.;;;;;2016-05-01T09:53:09+0000;1462096389;2016-05-01 11:53:09;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

You stopped stocking Robertsons lemon marmalade  you then stopped stocking Tesco own brand lemon marmalade.  As a result I have to go to Morrisons to get some lemon marmalade and therefore you lost ¬£40 of turnover as I bought my daily shop there. As an accountant it seems to me that is a rather poor loss making decision on your part.  There are nearly 2 metres of orange marmalade on display including 1 metre of shelving devoted to Tesco cheepie orange marmalade which it seems very few buy as the shelf is always full.  Thus for two rows of lemon marmalade you will lose a customers shop once in every four weeks. Thats really good management!;;;;;2016-05-01T09:48:57+0000;1462096137;2016-05-01 11:48:57;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Except when I read the exclusions everything except food is excluded. Now ¬£10 off a ¬£100 spend is very generous but I shop 3-4 times a week for fresh produce and although I spend more than ¬£100 in total its never together. Hence I will never use my vouchers.  So a bit of a shot in the foot methinks!;;;;;2016-05-01T09:44:03+0000;1462095843;2016-05-01 11:44:03;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0
