I love them and was really excited to see they were on special the other night almost 50% off.. so I bought a couple of jars. I had went onto the Tesco online today and discovered you are no longer supplying them. Disappointed by this i went to my local Tesco in Bellshill. I put 7 jars in my trolly and while I was doing the rest of my shop  thought depending when they expire  I will just buy a few more so i have a supply until i can see where else to buy them. When I looked at the date i was horrified to see that the date said March 2016!! I checked a second jar which said Feb 2016!!! I searched all over the jar to make sure that i hadn’t missread  all the jars had similar dates. I went back to the shelf to check the others and they were all the same! I said to a member of staff  who didn’t seem bothered by it at all.   I’ve came home to check the dates of other jars i have had in the house and they are all the same expiry too!!! Now I am wondering how many jars since Feb/March have I ate without realising they were out of date! I did think they were a bit more salty than normal and this explains why! Maybe someone should be checking the dates more often on the shelves as its 5/6months past the date.;;;;;2016-07-31T20:51:17+0000;1469998277;2016-07-31 22:51:17;1;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Today I suffered one of the  worst racism in my life from 4 staff members. I will do everything that actions takes in place. How dare that staff member asking only me if I bought for the plastic bag and other people did not ask? it is because I was the only black and she took the audacity and judgement and stereotyping black people of not paying for plastic bag. The security showed me more racism against black person even though he is black. The team leader and the manager  very horrible costumer service  they even do not know how to treat a pregnant costumer. I am ashamed of you.

I do a fair amount of motorway driving and notice branded trucks that drive courteously (and those that don t!) and have to compliment Tesco on the standards of their drivers.   Recently I was in a pub car park and saw a car pull out  inappropriately  in front of a Tesco 40 footer.  Both vehicles went out of sight behind some trees and I grabbed my phone to call the emergency services as I could see no way the truck could stop  but he did  bless him.  Not even a bump :-)  The local delivery drivers  in my area  are just as good - polite and courteous to other road users.    Anyway  just wanted to let you know that people do notice.

Sure enough he came over when we got to the end and sorted us out! My partner had run off to get some cotton wool which we had forgot  I informed the guy (I m pretty sure his name was Adam) having just had a c-section I would have to wait for my partner to come back to follow him as couldn t push the pushchair and trolley and he kindly went above and beyond taking our trolley over and unpacking and even taking some time to have some banter with my toddler and putting a drinks bottle straight through so he could have it back and not go into toddler meltdown!

I visited the Blackburn Hill Street branch of your store and unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances  arrived at the store shortly before closing time. Luckily I only needed to purchase a few essential items. Upon arrival I was informed the store was closing in 10 minutes which was fine as that would give me ample time to grab a few essentials. Around the whole shop I was harassed by staff members following me around and telling me the store is closing soon. A few staff members also decided to beep the horns or their forklifts at me numerous times  which I found extremely intimidating in an attempt to force me leave the store. Other customers were still shopping in the store but staff members were happy to help them  scanning their items and not rushing them along. I found the whole experience disgustingly rude. I would not expect this from Tesco. I will not be shopping with Tesco again. In the future I will drive the extra 4 minutes to Asda where I will treated like a human  with respect!;;;;;2016-07-30T23:59:46+0000;1469923186;2016-07-31 01:59:46;1;4;1;0;5;4;3;1;6;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Not only did I leave feeling embarrassed and humiliated  I also felt like a naughty school child in the playground!   On entering the store today with my partner  I went to get some alcohol as we was going out tonight  but my partner didn t feel well so I said go and get in the car and ill pay for the stuff. So at the self checkout I presented my ID  to be told that it looks dark? Surly the DVLA wouldn t allow me a driving licence if my picture was too dark? Not only that the security guard then came over and asked my where my partner had gone  and that he d been watching us walk around the store? and because he walked a completely different way to me it look suspicious. He also asked if he ID which I stated he left at home because he wasn t buying the alcohol it was myself. All this was done while people were watching  you can see now why I felt humiliated. Why should I have to justify myself to someone who is suppose to speak to you in a nice manor? I think you need to look at the staff you are hiring and the way they are speaking to customers because I wont be attending that store again after the way I was spoken to and the way I was made to feel just because my partner was ill and wanted to sit in the car.;;;;;2016-07-30T14:59:53+0000;1469890793;2016-07-30 16:59:53;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My 4 year old daughter slipped and banged her head on the hard tiled floor as the store staff had failed to ensure that the water from the pipe that was leaking in the entrance to the store was cleaned up and marked with appropriate signage. We had to leave the store without actually getting any shopping so we could get my daughter home to make sure she was ok.  The pipe in the entrance way has a constant drip  which was being caught in 2 buckets. 2 yellow warning signs were positioned behind the buckets. However  in front of the bucket was a large puddle of water. This is where my daughter slipped and banged her head. The store staff came over however it took a good 10 minutes for the water to be cleaned up  and even longer for the First Aider to arrive check my daughters head. The whole area should have been cordoned off with signs on both sides of the buckets to ensure that it was clear to everyone. My 4 year old doesn’t yet read  and didn’t know that the warning signs on the other side of the bucket would mean there was danger where she was walking.  We were told that a full investigation would take place to find out what had caused the leak  and to make sure that it is fixed. I live locally to Bedworth Tesco  and come into the store as a loyal customer at least once or twice a week  and can assure you that this leak has been a feature of the store for some months. There are often buckets on the floor catching the drips and the pipe that is leaking is all brown from where it has been leaking for some time. So to be told that a ‘full investigation’ would take place in order to find out ‘how it happened’ is a massive insult. This should have been looked into and fixed as soon as it started leaking  as it is a huge safety hazard.   The store staff gave my daughter a new dress as her own dress was soaking wet  and a drink and an apology  however that simply isn’t good enough. I’d like to know how you aim to rectify the issue in store  and make amends for the injury caused to my 4 year old please  as I don’t feel as though this incident has been dealt with seriously enough.;;;;;2016-07-30T13:54:27+0000;1469886867;2016-07-30 15:54:27;2;10;9;1;20;10;7;3;0;0;2;0;0;0;3;4;0

To my eye there are still way too many littering our roads & countrysides. I wrote to a number of large supermarkets recently asking them to consider paper bags (at least they degrade a bit quicker) SAINBURYS were the least open to this idea  saying it wasn t practical!!! Tell that to most American supermarkets. MORRISONS didn t reply! TESCO - said great idea & sent me a £10 voucher. ASDA also thought it a good idea. I even suggested they offset costs and get their marketing to offer paper bags as advertising space to major suppliers - off setting a charge to customers! Nice to see that it s been ignored! Still if they know that we ll buy these fancy hessian bags (I m a bit of a sucker for these) & these supermarkets can make a profit from our efforts to be environmentally friendly  then they ll be happy anyway! Simply BAN plastic bags - I just hope supermarkets read this? Just one of my pet hates...;;;;;2016-07-30T07:50:31+0000;1469865031;2016-07-30 09:50:31;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

May I add both over 70 years old who spend easily 5/6 days a week if not everyday shopping and using tesco as a supermarket. Speaking on behalf of them I think it s disgraceful that they have been penalised due to be elderly and not quite understanding the exact time scale they may be allowed. They must spend a couple of hours a day in tesco cafe enjoying a cup of coffee from Costa  which also the cafe staff can confirm what  regular  customers my grandparents are as they know they order before they even walk in and kindly bring the hot drinks over to their table. Not once have they been confronted to say that they may run over their allowed period in the car park also baring in mind don t think it would be suitable to say they would be able to run over to the car to rush out also - however if my elderly grandparents held a disabled badge they would be allowed extra time. I think this is extremely hurtful to know my poor   Nan and grandad can now not enjoy a relaxing break in tesco cafe due to the pressure of a timescale in a car park which has ample free spaces everyday!

I was appalled with the customer service I received at the cigarette kiosk when I went to purchase a crate of cider. Upon walking up to the desk (I had not yet reached the till) I was asked for identification and I was not offended in the slightest as I know you have a  challenge 25  rule.  However  when I showed my valid drivers license it was inspected thoroughly by the worker. As she inspected for longer than the usual person would I offered my student card (which holds a picture and my date of birth) and debit card to confirm my name. The worker informed me that my drivers license was not able to be used as ID as it was a UK drivers license  and was asked if I had an Irish one or my passport  and then directed to  try the off license across the street . I was not impressed as I left my passport at home (2 hours drive away) and wanted to buy a cider that is only available in the Republic of Ireland.  I found this interaction extremely discriminatory as I was singled out for holding a UK drivers license rather than an Irish one  and the way the situation was handled.  I was informed that it was  store policy  to not accept a UK drivers license and I would like to confirm if this is true  and if so  why would it not be accepted as valid identification?  Perhaps if the worker actually looked at my date of birth rather than trying to see it was fake there wouldn t be such an issue.;;;;;2016-07-29T15:27:43+0000;1469806063;2016-07-29 17:27:43;68;6;70;1;77;6;2;4;7;0;68;1;0;1;0;0;0

But to safe guard anyone further it might be worth considering. Thanks to both Matt and Jamie though from the store who helped clean up all the blood and gave him a toy to take his mind off things.

They stand at the exit wanting you to set up a wee direct debit and shoot you a look of disgust if you say no. We all know this lot are on commission and they re hoping to guilt a few people into a £10 monthly direct debit on pay day.  I would like these  salesmen   because that s what they are  to be replaced with people collecting for local causes. You know  the people with buckets.

Inside the store was a company selling Paintballing experiences as was promoting a  special discounted offer . As he had recently been paint balling with some friend he asked his Grandmother if she could buy the offer £61.99 for his birthday. She agreed. As his birthday is not until December we have done nothing with the vouchers until today. I was aware when he cam home that the voucher was valid until 30.05.17 so there was not a problem. There however is a problem. The company promoting their services within you store is committing  in my opinion fraud  supported by yourselves allowing them to sell within the store. I have today looked at booking his party for the end of the summer holidays. I know very little about paint balling  not does my son or his grandmother. However this morning I have been researching and hence my comment about fraud. A  normal  party for an 11 year old group of 10 children  with 500 paintballs (the minimum really required for a good party) at most paint balling sites would cost between £275.00 £350.00. When looking at the voucher my son has  we were expecting a price to be less than this  after all is is a special offer with the Tesco store. I am sure you will be as surprised as I am to find out that a compatible party with the company you are promoting would cost a staggering £561.00 or over double my cheapest alternative quotation. How can Tesco possibly endorse companies that are being fraudulent and af course hide behind the terms and conditions although they are targeting in this case elderly and juniors who have no understand of what they are signing up to. Sadly my son s birthday money has now been spent and he has nothing other than a worthless piece of card to show for it. I look forward to hearing your comments. The company in question is IPG  International Paintball Group. Regards;;;;;2016-07-28T11:06:40+0000;1469704000;2016-07-28 13:06:40;0;11;0;0;11;11;3;8;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

However  I must say that I think my parents are a more suitable fit for your advertising campaign and really show what Tesco is all about.  Here is how I imagine an advert to be:   The advert begins by showing the insides of a house beginning with the front room. The sun is shining brightly through the window and the faint tweeting of birds can be heard. A cat scampers through the shot. It then changes to the kitchen  you see a can of Tesco baked beans on the side – seemingly to have been missed when the shopping had been put away.  The camera now moves to the front door  a shadow appears on the other side of the door and some letters are pushing through the letterbox. Then  one more envelope is pushed through – a Tesco clubcard letter! It falls gracefully onto the top of the other  unimportant letters.  A scuffle is heard originating from upstairs. While still looking at the pile of letters  banging and crashing can be heard as two people come rushing down the stairs towards the letters – these would be my parents. They force their way towards the letters  fighting for the clubcard letter.   At the same time they both pick it up. Squabbling like a pair of children  they bicker and pull at the letter trying to get it in their control. The letter rips open. The clubcard vouchers have been destroyed!   Each parent now blames the other for the unfortunate damage of these little vouchers of glory. My dad tells my mum they were his – he fills ups with petrol at Tesco every week. My mum tells my dad they were hers – she does the weekly shop at Tesco. Each holding a ripped half of the vouchers they are bickering stronger about what is worth more club card points  the petrol or food shop.  Then my brother walks down the stairs  woken up by the commotion that has just gone on. He asks what the fuss is about – they are only vouchers. In his tired and somewhat confused state  he ambles into the kitchen and opens the can of baked beans and begins eating them.   In the final seconds  the Tesco logo and slogan appears ‘Tesco  every little helps.’ With the additional line of ‘Earn clubcard points on petrol and your grocery shop’.;;;;;2016-07-27T20:56:52+0000;1469653012;2016-07-27 22:56:52;1;1;1;1;3;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Only you could come up with the fantastic idea of moving all your stock around on the first week of the school summer holidays. Shopping with children is soooo much fan when we know where stuff is. Just imagine the extra joy of not knowing where to find anything  while coping with little ones who don t want to be there  As for moving your free from range to the same lane as  normal  bread  cakes  cream cakes  etc. Inspired. It will be such fan now  can no longer simply avoid going past them  but actually have to explain every visit to a small child why they cannot have those other cakes  or that nicer looking bread. Pure genius to put the right next to each other.   And those big blue signs  saying where stuff has moved to. How cleaver to put them at the new location  instead of the old. Makes it more like a treasure hunt  with a note telling you when your right. Would make life so boring voting if they were at the old location so we actually had an idea where to look;;;;;2016-07-27T20:44:46+0000;1469652286;2016-07-27 22:44:46;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I m currently on a diet so the lucky sod got to enjoy them all to himself. Unfortunately after devouring the first donut and telling me how lovely it was he went back to enjoy the second donut only to find to his horror a bite sized portion was missing! He wanted me to write to you as it is quite simply not acceptable to sell such delicious donuts with portions missing. If you could please investigate this matter further it would be much appreciated as I would hate for other husbands to be left as disappointed as mine.

I Returned back to the store and spoke to the same member of staff showing them that one had a blue secured security strip and the other had a silver void strip that was tampered with. They assured me that the phone was brand new never opened another college interjected that the blue strips tare all the time. When realising I was talking about the silver void strip he said it was just an older sticker and the blue ones are the new ones. I asked if I should open it there in front of them they said no everything will be ok. They assured me again the phone was brand new never been opened.  When I came to opening the box once back home am particularly unimpressed to find the plastic screen cover on upside down taking this off the screen is covered in sticky finger prints and has text messages on from 12th July and Scuffs on the back cover.

Please can you pass over a huge thank you to the Falkirk retail park store  the slim  blonde lady in the pharmacy and manager Michelle. My 6 week old baby decided he needed a feed in the shop and started screaming  was waiting on medicine for him which the lovely lady rushed through  could hear James crying and came to me and gave me the prescription. Offered to help with my shopping and gave James a cuddle whilst I sorted his bottle. My day got worse as I went to till and after putting through a few items I realised I had forgot my purse. Michelle helped me out with this and then to my car. Big big thank you. Excellent customer care going above and beyond. Please make sure they are recognised!;;;;;2016-07-27T16:54:52+0000;1469638492;2016-07-27 18:54:52;109;16;113;3;132;16;7;9;22;0;109;4;0;0;0;0;0

We placed a £140 order to be delivered today between 3-4pm. We advised the driver that they wouldn t be able to gain access to the site and we d meet them at the gate. We got there at 2:45. He rang me at 3:10 and as I have limited signal he left an answer phone message to say he was there. I rang him back and he said he d waited but had left. He then said he couldn t bring my order. I rang your delivery hotline and after a lengthy conversation was told that they wouldn t deliver it until 9:30. Unacceptable. We have no food and 4 children to feed. Every little helps does it??

My Wife ordered a set of 3 suitcases (14/07) from your Tesco Direct service which we have used a number of times with no issues. We are going away in 4 weeks To our sons wedding in Greece and decided to replace our tatty luggage with some new ones.. they were ordered and paid for.. to be delivered to our local Tesco shop only 150 yards from our house.. as my wife is disabled and needs 24 hour care that suited me as its a 2 minute trip. Today when the cases were due we were told they had been delivered to the wrong store!!!  Luckily that store is only a 10 minute drive so she said we would go and pick them up there instead.. but no.. we couldnt because the cases had been returned.. i mean how?? what?? when?? now she was imformed it could take 2 weeks for them to go back on stock and that at the moment she couldnt order more as they were showing as out of stock!!  I mean they were delivered and returned the same day?? surely they must of seen that they were for a different store to know to send them back anyway.. so why couldnt they just drive along one road.. YES REALLY.. ONE ROAD and deliver it to the right store??   I dont know how it went to the wrong store other than driver error.. which i get.. but to deliver them and return them in no time at all must surely mean the error was noticed immediately.. so.. again why as we were expecting them at  a store no more than 3 miles away at least get out phone number and ask if we could collect there??  really not impressed with this and will think seriously before using the service again.  UPDATE Rang and complained and was told that a set of luggage would be sent directly to our home address by the manufacturer.. asked when to expect and told it would be monday (25/07) at the latest.... today (27/07) had to call again to find out where the luggage was and was told the manufacturer didnt have our postcode.. ?? details available and supplied to the adviser on the 1st call.. then told a set would be with us tomorrow.. (28/07) now we have just got a call back saying it would be going to the store.. which one they couldnt say .. but would ring back to advise.. since the call my wife has had a seizure which i think was caused by the stress of this.. really not happy and all we get is one saying one thing and someone else saying different..now to top it all theyre showing online as back in stock!!! hope your happy.. cos im not.!!;;;;;2016-07-27T12:12:34+0000;1469621554;2016-07-27 14:12:34;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

It is great to have a local store for the occasional items and using the delivery service for our main shop.  The team are very helpful and friendly  so all good so far.  Unfortunately on the 2nd of July whilst eating one of your Tesco Low Fat Berry Medley Yoghurts we encountered a pubic hair.  As you can imagine you would normally expect fruit  but not a body hair from the genital area.  The yoghurt had been half eaten when the hair was found  which is even worse.  We took the soiled item back to our main store where the very helpful assistant took all the information and processed a report to be sent off for further investigation.  So far so good  it was all taken very seriously  as it should be.  This is where the good customer service has stopped.  It is now 25 days since the incident and we have heard nothing from @Tesco #tesco. #epicfail from a customer service point of view.  I have phoned customer service and they said there is a letter on the way  but you could have hand delivered the letter by now.  They have said that they will send another letter  but again I have no idea how long that will take to arrive  if it ever does.  We want to start using Tesco again  but don’t have the confidence that you take your customer concerns and care seriously enough.  This was not a head hair or face hair  but a genital pubic hair.  How would you feel if you were half way through your yoghurt and you found one.  Awful.  Currently we have switched to using Asda (who I have to say have very nice delivery drivers  and seem to be cheaper for the weekly shop) until we hear anything from you to say sorry  or that you are taking this seriously it is difficult to remain the loyal customers that we have been for so many years.  You should be using correct GMP processes in the manufacture of dairy based items  and to find a pubic hair in the product is of deep concern that the processes that you have in place are not being followed.  As an organisation you should be concerned that this has happened.  Just to be taken seriously would be nice and that you are as concerned as I am that you have had some major failures in the manufacturing process of your own branded products.  Once again some sort of response would be great as we want to go back to using you for our shopping again as you do so many great things  clubcard points for example.  Many thanks in advance.  Kind regards   Paul;;;;;2016-07-27T11:31:42+0000;1469619102;2016-07-27 13:31:42;16;14;16;0;30;13;5;8;2;0;16;0;0;0;0;0;0

When my sons difficulties started it was the comments and stares that resulted in my son and I not leaving the house  which subsequently resulted in my sons further development delays and me having a breakdown. We have worked hard to get where we are today. A member of your team called Mel  who asked if she could push my trolley so we could ensure a happier shopping experience. This may have been so the other customers didn t get put off by my screaming son  however for me it meant more than anything. My son calmly walked around the shop  holding my hand and Mel interacted with him  made him giggle and helped me getting things off the shelf. The extra staff who found bits  replaced broken/damaged goods I picked up  all while doing a stock take.  Also the other two ladies who helped with the packing at the end. I would like to thank each member of staff who assisted me today  but especially Mel. She has bought tears of happiness to my eyes today. If you have any awards for your staff  I would like to put Mel forward  as without her help today  I think I would ve given up again. Kindest regards Michelle (a very tired and stressed mummy of Charlie  the noisy tinker);;;;;2016-07-27T10:39:32+0000;1469615972;2016-07-27 12:39:32;218;27;242;21;290;27;16;11;60;0;217;24;0;0;0;0;0

We live locally. My sons 11 (12 on Friday) he has learning difficulties and we are awaiting an assessment for autism. He finds shopping really difficult. We get alsorts of behaviours as you can imagine. So by the time we finally get to the check out as you can imagine I m fraught from trying to keep him calm and he s wound up and frustrated because it s too much. But it s summer holidays and needs must! So I got to the check out and the gentleman who was serving us got him scanning the items through the till with the hand held scanner. It automatically defused Ryan and he started to relax and laugh! Something that doesn t usually happen in supermarkets. I don t think this man (I ve forgotten his name sorry) even realised how much of a godsend he was! My other son was with us too and he let him have a go too. It made the whole process off packing our bags so much easier! We had no behaviours at the check out and he stayed calm. The whole experience was a positive one. It made for a better evening when we got home right down to it being easier to get him into bed. It also gave him something to focus on rather than him being focused on negatives. He will never forget the experience! So thank you Tesco your man deserves to be praised!;;;;;2016-07-27T09:24:24+0000;1469611464;2016-07-27 11:24:24;6;2;6;0;8;2;2;0;1;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;0

It managed to seep its ink into my fave t shirt  and horror of horrors......would NOT WASH OUT even with a high end stain remover  and had to be binned. So disappointed. I used to be a teacher and all our school felt pens were washable unless VERY CLEARLY MARKED AS PERMANENT. Very disappointed  and I think the product should be investigated so folk are clear what they are purchasing. Hope you will look into this.

I came to the tesco store in Carlton Nottingham around 6.15pm and saw how busy the car park was. I saw a lady getting out of her car with no child in her car but parked in a mother and baby space. The last space might I add. Now I was not happy as I had my 9 week old with me and no bigger spaces for my to park in.  As the lady was walking off I noticed she was wearing a tesco uniform. She looked at me and walked off. The cheek of it!!! I gather she was off to work her evening shift!!!;;;;;2016-07-26T17:53:00+0000;1469555580;2016-07-26 19:53:00;0;24;0;0;24;24;4;20;10;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

When shopping last Sunday I slipped over in a very large puddle in the fruit and veg section after stepping off the  non slip mats. The puddle was so large and slippery that it was only by the help of my trolley that I managed to get back up. I can t understand in such a large main branch there was only one caution sign put out down the other end of the isle and nowhere near the actual wet area  even one at each end of the isle seems the safe and logical answer.  When I found a member of staff who was floating about the till area so that more signs and safety privations could be issued she just told me that the fridges were broken and they knew they were leaking. She was very rude and off hand to me considering I had just fallen over.   It has now been a few days since falling and my knee is still very bruised which has made walking and working extremely painful.

Phoned up and explained  and have been told to reorder the items for tomorrow and get the other items sent back. I ve been given a voucher which just about covers the extra delivery cost and the extra cost for the order not being over the £40 basket value. But what about the inconvenience it is causing me  having to stay in again tomorrow to wait for more shopping when I have other things to do! This isn t the first time this has happened to us.

My husband gave me the adrenalin treatment that I needed  while store members took care of my daughter and called an ambulance for me.  While I was unconcious they brought a cushion and blanket and the first aider sat by me and kept my husband calm.  Once I had been taken away in the ambulance  they helped him fetch the shopping that we had originally needed to collect for a meal for our other children  waiting at home.  My daughter had been well cared for and kept happy  away from seeing me in such a condition.  My husband has been in a couple of times since then and they have asked about me  which is very much appreciated.  I made my first trip back there last night (waited until late so that the store was quite quiet) which was scary  but something that I had to do.  I very much appreciate everything that was done in the store for me that day and wish that I could do more to thank the people involved.  The A+E doctor says that my husband saved my life by realising what was happening and giving me my epipen in time  and the people in the store gave me great peace of mind by knowing they cared for my husband and daughter while I could not.  You have some great employees at this store  Tesco  I hope you appreciate them as much as I do.  Thank you.;;;;;2016-07-26T10:33:49+0000;1469529229;2016-07-26 12:33:49;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

However because I know which store my groceries come from I went there as I had forgotten something  and what did i discover. The products which I was told that were not availible online  where plentiful (stacks) of them instore.  Does tesco do this to make people go intore? Doing shopping online is supposed to make it convienient  however if you make products unavailible online whilst you have stacks of them instore  it makes it very inconvienient. Why do you do this?  Can t your servers hold all the information  if not upgrade them! - Most shops are going the other way carry less instore and put more items online.;;;;;2016-07-26T09:01:51+0000;1469523711;2016-07-26 11:01:51;0;5;0;0;5;5;2;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

If you were to check my clubcard records you d see that I spend hundreds of pounds a week with you (and obviously you get all that juicy clubcard data about my spending habits that go with it)  and have done for countless years. I m a huge Tesco fan by choice  and quite often you d find me singing your praises to other people when I talk about my  Big Shop Monday  trip to your Stockport store  largely down to the lovely staff you have there.  I feel we ve developed a great relationship. I ve stuck with you through the lean years  when you were  creative  with your accounting and everyone left you for the discount stores  or went upmarket and visited to Waitrose. That wasn t me though. Your prices suited me fine  and your staff in Stockport are always making sure that every little helped.  When I found there were a few items on my shopping list that I couldn t fulfill in Stockport tonight  I didn t think of going to the nearby Sainsbury s or Asda I would pass on the way home.  No  I thought   I ll stick by Tesco and go to Stalybridge  because I prefer Tesco.  I am such an awkward customer. You go out of your way to keep these stores open 24 hours a day for my convenience  so that I wouldn t need to visit my local corner shop run by  the little guys . Of course if you re always open then you re going to need to do your store shelf moves before 10pm on a Monday night. I can t believe what a fool I am for not realising this until now!  There was me just wanting to grab a packet of ice cream wafers in Stalybridge that weren t available in Stockport  but clearly this is too much to ask when you need to move your shelves around. And foolishly I thought those signs up everywhere saying words to the effect of  ask a member of staff for help if you can t find what you re looking for  were genuine! Silly me  of course the staff don t want to be interrupted from their casual chatting to try and help a customer! Why on earth would they want to make the company money from a sale  when they must get on with this shelf move (and the casual chat)?!  As you may have guessed by now  my request for assistance to find what I was looking for fell on deaf ears  because said ice cream wafers could have been in any number of the crates  and despite me talking to the lady who filled the crates  she couldn t possibly stop working on filling the shelf she was focusing on and check any of the crates  because she couldn t remember which crate they were in  and there were so many crates around not to mention the crates in the warehouse. And in any case  I could just wait around because once the other lady had finished working on the pile of boxes she was assigned  she might be going to unpack the ones that have the ice cream wafers in next! In hindsight  I should have realised what a wonderful offer this was  but here s me being an awkward customer again  wanting to get home and unpack my other shopping from Stockport.  When I interrupted the customer services lady from doing her shopping at the pharmacy (she was still on shift  as when I was leaving she was back working behind the customer services desk)  and asked her if I was being unreasonable in my request to have someone help me locate a product that I could exchange money for (pretty sure that s the business you re in?) she kindly showed me the error of my ways in asking this!  I ve worked in retail before  so I know how difficult customers like me are. We re the worst sort  because deep down we should know better from our own experiences of those pesky customers who want to purchase goods  keeping the company we work for in business and paying me a wage!  So that s it Tesco: that s why I am so sorry for trying to be a customer tonight. I really will try to be a better human and not have such high expectations the next time I come in store. And I will come in store still - ours is a long story still to be told. But just don t expect me to be so happy about visiting you from now on.  Yours apologetically;;;;;2016-07-25T22:39:49+0000;1469486389;2016-07-26 00:39:49;17;20;20;0;40;20;6;14;11;0;17;0;0;3;0;0;0

We also got some rock solid doughnuts - inedible. Thanks Tesco!;;;;;2016-07-25T18:27:24+0000;1469471244;2016-07-25 20:27:24;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Maybe instead of patronising my husband and ignoring what he is saying can I suggest you update things on time to avoid getting complaints and losing service. However  I am not surprised as the last time I complained after eating a mouthful of mud in a prepacked salad and being told I would be refunded and given £5 compensation all I got was a straight refund.   No compensation for a mouthful of mud then??? Your response to being advised of a pricing error is simply to tell my husband he is wrong??? Happily my ocado order is booked for tomorrow  I had previously considered changing due to delivery timing issues but your awful customer services has helped me to decide so thanks for that.  (Please no patronising responses  it wasn t cache  though I can t believe we are having to explain that again );;;;;2016-07-25T17:50:09+0000;1469469009;2016-07-25 19:50:09;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

As my key bunch had a Tesco clubcard fob- it was handed in to the local express Tesco store. A kind employee tried to track down my details via the clubcard however unsuccessfully and then resumed to contact a local gym as it had the membership fob in the key bunch. They were able to contact me directly via the gym membership contact details.  I cannot express how thankful and appreciative I am towards all those involved in this process to reunite me with my keys including the person who handed them in  to those at the gym who were willing to help. However the lady at your store went above and beyond her call of duty by trying to find my details via any means necessary. I would like to pass on my sincerest thanks and gratitude to Ms Charlie Fletcher at your Sutton Coldfield express store for being an amazing person as well as an invaluable employee and asset to your company. I was unable to meet her directly as she had finished her shift by the time I had time to go collect my keys... I hope that these words will reach her directly.

As I have had to do several times recently  I took the overcharged item to customer services.  She went and got a weedkiller tag from the shelves and agreed I had been overcharged.  She wrote all the info down in a booklet and told me she had to put it through the computer as an over charge so it would take a few minutes.  5 minutes later  she realised she d got the wrong label from the shelves.  Clearly  going back to the shelf was too much hard work so she just agreed with the price I d said.    What I did notice was  while she was writing in her book  was that she d initially written the refund as £7 but then only gave me £3.50.  I ve now looked at your T&C and seen that if we are overcharged  we should get back double the difference (hence the £7).  Because SHE couldn t be bothered to go through the process again  I didn t receive this promise.  In fact  I ve never received this despite returning several wrongly priced items!! It appears to be a promise that is obviously only given to those who know about it!!  Another very recent example I have is buying Stampy s Lovely Book as a present.  I was charged £7.99 when the ticket price was £4.  Again  I had to spot the mistake and take it up with customer service.  Again  no  double the difference  applied to my refund.

Not only is it hard enough to take my 17 month old twins out shopping to then have to hunt the two seater trolley down which is pretty much impossible as you only have 8 for the Tesco extra with hundred of shoppers at one time. I am left with three options option 1) abandon my children in the car to hunt the elusive trolley down which could take forever in the meantime could well be reported for leaving children u attended  option 2) use the one seated trolley and put the other on the trolley which I don t feel comfortable about  or option 3) take my pushchair and get only what I can carry. This is not acceptable as shopping at Asda or Tesco Thornbury is never a problem but it s always the same in the Bradley Stoke store. I spoke with the trolley collector and he said he has been telling them this for ages I also spoke with one of the managers Marika who told me that they are aware of this and will look into getting more double seated trolleys. I must say I would hesitate shopping here again until I know the situation have changed.;;;;;2016-07-25T15:16:29+0000;1469459789;2016-07-25 17:16:29;2;3;2;0;5;3;1;2;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

On the website the item I wanted was showing as £19 but every time I put it in the basket it was coming up as £35. This was using my mobile so tried with my pc. Same thing happened. I ve called customer services who didn t seem to want to listen to my problem / complaint  (which was the difference between advertised price and checkout price) and was just told repeatedly the item wasn t in the sale anymore. OK  but that doesn t address the falsely advertised price issue. So  was also told there was nothing that could be done. I m sorry  I hate that phrase as it s simply not true. I asked to speak to someone else only to be told the manager would only tell me the same thing. Thanks  but I ll speak to them all the same. Turns out they weren t available. What customer service arrangement doesn t have a line of escalation available? Conveniently  while I was on the lphone the price error had been fixed.  I was told the manager would call me back. Needless to say that didn t happen. So thanks Tesco  for the sake of a £16 error I will be taking my literally thousands of pounds my family spends with you elsewhere unless I am at least acknowledged.

I m a student nurse (with very little money) who purchased an acer laptop in store 4 months ago (14-03-16). The laptop purchased was recommended by a Tesco employee as being one of the  best  laptops for students and my needs. Since Iv had the laptop it crashed on the first day of purchase and it has crashed an broken down on many many occasions (more than 60 times at least) resulting in me taking the laptop back to store to be fixed. On Saturday (23-07-16) the hard drive broke stating  No Bootable Device . I phoned the Tesco help line to be told by a very rude man that there was nothing he can do an I need to contact Acer on Monday morning. As I only have one week of my second year at university left I have a lot of work that needs to be completed  printed off and handed in to the university to demonstrate I am still competent when caring an treating vulnerable patients. All this work was on the laptop. Although I had backed up majority of it I have lost the last 4 months of work since Iv owned the laptop as the laptop was failing to save my work on my memory stick an I only just found this out  In absolute desperation I went in to Tesco store to seek help  well  not only am I an exhausted over-worked nursing student I was completely inconsolable when the un-empathetic technical support manager told me that he will not do anything to help  would not offer any solution except phone Acer. I explained  to the manager I only needed a laptop for  just 1 more week an if I worked 18-20 hour days for the next 7 days straight I just might be able to re-do all the work lost  that s providing I can do it from memory. But again NO HELP  NO SOLUTION  not even the offer of a loan laptop for 1 week this I was willing to pay for and go overdrawn on my bank BUT NO!!! So as you can guess I left the store crying my eyes out an panicking about how I m going to pass this year at uni. So yes I phoned Acer this morning (25-07-16)  only to be told before I send the laptop to Acer to be fixed I HAVE TO PAY a technician to recover the work on the laptop  I had a quote a few years ago an it was hundreds of pounds so as I can barely afford to eat on my bursery this is not an option so I will lose all my work  THEN Acer told me they will send me an email which I need to open on the laptop an I can print of the return label 😂 HOW !!! My laptop is broken so instead I now have to wait up to several days for the return label to be sent in post   rap the laptop in exactly 4 inches of bubble rap which I have to pay for  then put it in a cardboard box which I have to pay for  then rap the box in brown paper which I have to pay for  drive to the other end of town to post it (fuel I have to pay for) an if the UPS delivery service damage the laptop then Acer will not cover the damage  FANTASTIC customer service NOT !!!! Oh and the best part is I will be with out my laptop for up to 6 weeks  so now tesco/Acer have my money and they will have my laptop. So I have no money an no laptop an out of pocket for bubble rap cardboard box an brown paper an fuel and 4 months worth of my wasted time AND NO Chance of completing this year at university so THANK YOU Tesco for your discussing appalling non existent customer service. Please don t teach your employees to ask if they can help because they don t  words are cheap an actions speak loader than words.  Yours sincerely  an overworked exhausted underpaid no longer student nurse xx;;;;;2016-07-25T12:04:51+0000;1469448291;2016-07-25 14:04:51;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Have always recommended them and said how good they were due to a few years ago when our dog was ill and they really looked after her. Now a few years later (no more health concerns or issues) we have two dogs insured with them . I have now found out our older dog who was the one who was ill has just had the premium go up from £88.00 and is now £164 .00      My 1 year old dog I have just found out is now on the phone to Tesco was £18.47 and is now  £33.50                       I asked the lady on the phone why . The reply as due to her age (15.01.07) and government policies / tax vet fees have gone up / changed etc . This was rhymed off from a sheet. So the lesson is loyal customers with older dogs beware.

I have a 3 month old baby and a 3 year old so shopping in store is a bit of a challenge. This week I took my 3 month old and decided to use shop and scan. Seemed like a good idea and although it took a little longer as I m not used to it it was easier when I got to the checkout. The problems I found were  the trolley that I used (the car seat trolley) did not have a holder for the scanner. So not only could I not see over my trolley  I had to push it whilst holding my shopping list and the scanner! I was selected for a random bag check  fine  except a member of your staff took several items out of my perfectly packed bags and dumped them back in the trolley. Thanks for that  really helpful!! Then when I came to have a coffee after my shop the trolley doesn t fit in the trolley park so I had to drag the ridiculously heavy trolley round the tiny cafe with me!!!!

Got to the door at Galashiels to be told that the store in only open till 12 on sat and sun night  this is an outrage and will not be shopping in any of your stores again  you should not advertise something as 24/7 if it isn t.

Less than a year ago I bought a double metal bed frame from tesco and tonight I am dismantling it as the frame has bent so badly its not repairable. Now  I am not a big lady at all  I am actually 5 3 and a professional dancers so no unusually excessive weight has been pressed upon the frame.   I am quiet upset as I just don t have another £200 for a bed frame this month but more upset that this bedframe didn t last a year! The quality of the product was not worth the money I paid for it. The frame I had before this one lasted 7 years and was still sold on and used.

Just wondering if you could give me a bit of information on your age/identification requirements. I was trying to buy a pack of cigarettes today and was informed I d need to show ID. I informed the lovely checkout girl that I m 37  but dutifully showed my drivers licence however I was then informed that because my *30* year old friend didnt have ID with her we would not be able to purchase the cigarettes. Tell me  if I enter the store in the future with one of my children will I also be refused service (they are both under 13 and have neither driving licence  student card or passport) or should I play it safe and leave them unattended in the car-park?;;;;;2016-07-24T19:34:57+0000;1469388897;2016-07-24 21:34:57;2;5;2;0;7;5;1;4;7;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

The Cooperatve in Glynneath is the ONLY supermarket that donates food to the apes and monkeys at the Sanctuary. The branch at Ystradgynlais used to until Tesco and Asda between them squeezed them out and they closed. Safeway also used to donate until Morrisons replaced them. So did Sommerfield donate.

I shopped in one of your stores in tidworth  with my husband and 6month old child  I have been a loyal customer aswell as working for tescos when I was 18years old.   On this afternoon my husband and I had done a big weekly shop  I was just about to set up onto a checkout when I remembered I had forgotten tin foil  with that I left my husband with our son and trolley to start placing the Iteams on the checkout. After eventually finding my product I made my way back to find half my shopping already scanned through while my husband was still trying to load. With this I asked your member of staff to stop until we were ready to pack. She informed me how she was proud to be a fast scanner and that tescos take pride in this. I went on to ask her would she had done this if my nan or even an older person had been at her checkout and her reply was no.   Sir  why does it make a difference with the fact that my husband is a young man? A father trying to entertain a baby aswell as load a checkout  aswell as pack?  Why should it matter how fast you can get your customers out the door even though you spend good money advertising to get them in?  Do you fill pleasure in a customer like myself leaving your store feeling more stressed then when I came in?  Having to take time to send an email asking you to slow down.  I hope you don t feel like this was a wasted email  this was from a young wife and mother trying to have an easy shopping trip.

Been a customer for a couple of years even though they charged more than some other companies but how they have just treated me I can t tell people enough to stay well away. I moved into a new house two weeks ago with a supposedly better postcode and car was going to be in the garage at night rather than outside. I called them as soon as we moved in to change my details and they said as it was a new build home there system hadn t been updated but they made a note and would honour my insurance they also said they would let me know when in 2 days when it s been resolved. Ok I thought fair enough  5 more days past nothing so I called and was told don t worry it s our fault not yours we sort it. Another 4 days past so I called and and was told I would be called back in a few days but not to worry as it was there fault not mine. Ok I said then on day 15 since I first called I was called by Tesco s and put on hold while customer services spoke to the underwriters. Then the lady told me we are cancelling my insurance as they can t find my address as its a new build. Now my address is the start of an 8 year 3000 new house development with a high street etc etc so I would have thought it wouldn t be too hard to find as Royal Mail got it straight away and I m sure Tesco will want a finger in that pie somewhere. Now I was given no grace time or anything they said that was it cancelled! Now moving is stressful enough let alone when your wife is due to give birth at anytime so obviously my car is extremely important right now  I told them this and they didn t give a monkeys  after pleading I managed to get my insurance until Monday! I asked about showing some loyalty to their customers and was told that s it! They kept saying from the start it was their fault and not to worry then after being strung along for over two weeks they just cancel it! I think it s absolutely disgusting And I hope people reading this will think twice about using such a tin pot company with no understanding or show no loyalty to there customers;;;;;2016-07-23T21:54:05+0000;1469310845;2016-07-23 23:54:05;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Why oh why do you have parent and child spaces when you really couldn t care less who used them?  Now firstly I should probably apologise  as I m sure you are sick of seeing the same complaint from us lazy mothers time after time! But actually it s you that are missing the point (twice)... Firstly I don t mind if the spaces are the other end of your car park  I don t park there as its 2 minutes walk from your store. I park there to avoid a libel suit when my lovely little girl (who is 1) decides to do anything other than delicately slither out of her seat and carefully walk between the tiny orrifice which is the gap you allow between cars. Don t get me wrong  my daughter has never cried/kicked off/thrown a wobbly anywhere near your store  God forbid. But she still isn t delicate in her decent from her car seat. That s not to say she won t at some point though as that s just what kids do sometimes. But those parent and child spaces are a god send for us parents who don t care about the walk  but do want to care about other people s property. And here s the second point I mentioned earlier that you were missing... There s a lot of us mothers out there and we all feel the same! Give us those spaces and police them so they aren t miss-used and chances are we ll come flocking to your store  as Tesco  you aren t the only culprits. But if you actually marketed to us mothers  who use your stores frequently  and stood loud and proud against the others that only parents and babies can use those spaces  then your market share  your loss ratios  and your combined operating ratios (yes I actually know a little about this stuff) would look a lot more attractive. It s fairly simple  if you offer something  follow through. Hopefully next time I m at one of your stores I won t need a shoe horn to get me and my daughter out of our car as (from my last experience alone) a 25 year old man  40 something lady in gym gear  and someone with a BMW all decide to use them with their invisible children (I m sorry to generalise but just sighting what I saw!)... Shame on you!;;;;;2016-07-23T18:32:58+0000;1469298778;2016-07-23 20:32:58;9;15;9;0;24;15;9;6;11;0;9;0;0;0;0;0;0

While waiting to try her samples I could see that she was busy talking to a member of staff so I wandered to look at the price cut section and left my child waiting  they then took a bowl of popcorn each and walked over to me ( less than 2 meters away). My children are well mannered ( unlike this woman) who marched up  to me  They just took popcorn!  she shouted   I m sorry I thought they were samples  I said   they are but they need an adult  I replied that i dont eat popcorn that it would be for them and was only here anyway    it doesn t matter   I told her  fair enough  I wont be being any now- I noticed what I assumed to be  the  lady s  bank card on the floor  next to the stand and said   by the way your bank card is on the floor  -  its not even mine  she shouted with her bank to me. Her bad manners  tone of voice and general aggressive persona were extremely off putting and we left that section  and although I had intended to buy magazines from near her I felt too intimidated to go back to it.  You ought to vet the ppl who are hired for sampling  she has put me off this store Tesco and certainly off her products Walkers.;;;;;2016-07-23T18:04:55+0000;1469297095;2016-07-23 20:04:55;3;4;3;0;7;4;2;2;1;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have to complain very strongly about my visit to tescos at Pembury Kent today. Every year when we get hot weather the fridges and freezers at this store breakdown! It may only be two days of sunshine but sure as eggs are eggs down go the fridges. Today you have really exceled yourselves only a quarter of freezers were working and no chillers at all. This is totally unacceptable! I have been a loyal customer since this store first opened but you tested my patience to the full today! I have had to go to Asda and get all my chilled and frozen food. I do not appreciate having to go to two stores to get my weeks shopping. I suggest that you stop fiddling with your car park area and put money into reliable refrigeration! An apology to your staff would not go amiss either.l and every other customer today have been moaning and griping to them and I even offered to lay on a coach to take everyone to Asdas!

I watched as the little boy ran back to his mum super happy  and the smile on his face spread from ear to ear.

Today i purchased 2 items from your Bakery section at Tesco Metro  St Albans  Hertfordshire. The first was a pack of 2 pain au raisin.

Well  again - heavy/stodgy & only 1/4 was actually filled with apple!  I m not sure who was in charge of baking the products today  but they were not as tasty as when previously purchased - so much so that 1 from each pack was thrown away.

I didn t realise there was a 2 hour limit to parking in your section of the car park. The ticket states my duration was 3 hours 58 minutes  and consequently  I have been instructed to pay a fine of £70  (or reduced  to a rate of £40 if paid within 14 days).  Being a  valued customer  as stated in your own accompanied Tesco headed letter  I was wondering how many points I would add to my Tesco club card if I chose to pay this fine to Highview Parking  or as I like to refer to them corporate extortionists acting on behalf of Tesco? I suppose with spending £150 a week on groceries  around £200 a week on petrol/diesel  banking with you  having insurance policies with you  and having purchased tv s  laptops  and mobile phones with contracts  what s an extra £40  (£20 per hour parking)  reduced rate  or £70  (£35 per hour parking)  normal rate???  Every little helps  who? Tesco? Must be you  because it certainly isn t me. So this  Valued Customer  will now be cancelling phone contracts  closing accounts with Tesco Bank  buying insurance elsewhere  renewing technology elsewhere and spending £7500 on groceries  £10 000 on petrol/diesel in Asda  where I will pat my backside just like the advert  with the satisfaction of not giving you so much as 5p for a bag.

Ordered tesco groceries delivery to get a call that there s not enough money on my account to pay for the order (even though I specifically left more money than needed for the shopping) -  only to find out that the original price of my shopping went up £20!!! after tesco added their costs or something. And this is not the first time it happened. I understand £2-£3 difference  but £20!!! It s ridiculous! For that difference I can shop somewhere better. Will be cancelling my delivery saver today as I don t think I ll be ordering from you again. Planning my family budget and spending £150 on average each week for groceries I expect prices to not be raised £2o over a night! And yes  you totally ruined our barbecue plans for tomorrow.

The operator telephoned the store in question and the manger said he would get the two packs off rolls to me by 6.00 to 8.00pm...6.45 they were delivered!!!;;;;;2016-07-22T19:22:19+0000;1469215339;2016-07-22 21:22:19;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

As we got out of the car  my son fell and hurt both his knees quite badly. I took him into the store to get some tissue from the toilets  but they weren t in use.  I asked a member of staff if they could grab me some  instead he sent me a first aider who cleaned my son s knees and put plasters on them. My son was quite upset and in shock so the man gave him a toy to cheer him up!  I was then asked if i needed help with my shopping!  I was amazed with the care and consideration they gave to my son. I want to thank them again for their help and great kindness. THANK YOU! 👍😊;;;;;2016-07-22T19:16:11+0000;1469214971;2016-07-22 21:16:11;215;12;215;15;242;12;5;7;5;0;211;0;0;0;0;0;0

My wife noticed that the coconut oil she normally buys had increased in price by 50 PERCENT -FIFTY PERCENT!! What is Tesco playing at and how can they justify extortion such as this. While it might be understandable for items to increase in price it is not understandable that prices can be hiked by such a high level increase. When expressing her concern to the manager my wife came away with a take it or leave it feeling  as prices do go up. Tesco are forever advertising customer care And bending over backwards to keep the customer happy attitude  and really should look at my wife s experience to day as   an example of bad service and NO care.;;;;;2016-07-22T18:57:04+0000;1469213824;2016-07-22 20:57:04;2;5;2;0;7;5;1;4;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I recently placed an order online for the popular board game   Trivial Pursuit - Family Edition  I feel you may have take the  pursuit  part far too literally. I ll explain the reason for purchasing this item. My oldest son (4) starts school soon  and as educational as  jake and the neverland pirates  are along with  doc mcstuffins   I thought a bit of mental stimulation was in order to keep his active mind ticking over. Now comes the fun part. On Wednesday the 20th of July I ordered said game  for next day collection in the local Arbroath store  however it was not sent for collection for the following day  so I spoke to a kind person on your customer service line who apologised and refunded my delivery charge  and chucked in an extra £5 for the delay  thanks for that. Now we get to today (Friday) the extra £5 was already spent in my head for snacks to accompany the game  that my husband and I were a tad excited to play this evening  along with our oldest. It would be harsh of me at this point to compare your delivery skills to that of a Ryan air pilot  who somehow land at the wrong airport from time to time  but you managed to send my game  which at this point can only be compared to the likes of the quest for the holy grail. Back to the matter in hand  you sent my game for collection in Perth  a mere 40 miles away an 80 mile round trip. The customer service in store informed me that they could not get the item delivered for collection until Monday! That s pretty poor  so yes I did take a refund.. you may be asking yourself what are they going to do without trivial pursuit on a Friday night? That question has yet to be answered Tesco  I would say my night is ruined but I live life on the edge and have a pack of playing cards. I found the game online from a company that will remain nameless  that deliver tomorrow. Until next time. Good evening.;;;;;2016-07-22T17:18:20+0000;1469207900;2016-07-22 19:18:20;3;1;3;0;4;1;1;0;0;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

Fair enough  son was very disappointed but I said we d go to buy the game.  Called tesco for stock check at Sunderland extra store  told they had 4 in stock  drove down with soaking wet hair as trying to get ready for sons birthday meal to be told that have none in stock and that the four are probably faulty ones returned over time. So I ve now had to drive further to a sainsburys and paid £40 just for my son to be able to play a game on his xbox one on his birthday.

My son (17 - and his first job interview) was invited to an interview for a new phone shop coming to our local Tesco.  He had the interview on the 1st of June and completed the right to work etc.  He was told that he would receive a confirmation on his success or not within 2 weeks - that was nearly 8 weeks ago!  We have emailed the person three different times with no response.  The online application remains still  in review .  We have contacted the store themselves and they have not been able to resolve this  with their emails not being responded to either.  We know that the email address for the person conducting the interviews is correct as he initially responded with the right to work link.  I m sure that this is not the level of service Tesco expects from their staff and would appreciate a response to his application especially since he was assured he would be told even if he did not get the job.

My husband  myself and our 4yr old son  were shopping in the Bulwell store in Nottingham. Two weeks ago  my husband suffered a severe back injury  which has left him barely able to move  and in a lot of pain  with a lot of medications. Today was the first day my husband has left the house in the past two weeks  except for hospital and doctors appointments. He has been very fed up  and wanted to do something  normal  We had reserved a stores mobility scooter for my husband to use  my husband had barely managed to get from the car park  to the actual store doors  using his crutches  so i d gone upstairs to get the scooter for him. As we went around the store  my husband was feeling more unwell  and in a lot of pain and discomfort  he had taken some of his pain meds  but i was quite concerned how he was looking  the battery was running low on the scooter  so my husband made his way back to the customer service desk  whilst i quickly finished our shopping at the checkout with our son. Rachel Morris had seen my husband in obvious pain  and had been asking him if he was ok  or needed a drink or anything   and when i got there she was very concerned asking me if he was ok  and i said no  not really  My husband was barely able to move  without severe pain  and there was no way he d be able to manage his crutches to leave the store. My 4yr old was also playing up as he was fed up and cranky  but Rachel was very helpful  and got a trolley with a large wheelchair seat attached  and offered to take my husband down to the car park. She was chatty and friendly  and bubbly  my husband has been feeling very demoralised  going from a very active man  to being totally dependent  and had been feeling humiliated  and suffering anxiety  about his limited mobility. Rachel treated my husband with wonderful care respect and good humour  making him laugh  even as she struggled to push him in the chair trolley. Her warmth and caring was truly lovely  after a very stressful day. When i thanked her  she said she was just doing her job  but she did so much more than that  she helped us in a practical way  but more importantly  in a caring and compassionate way! Tesco should be extremely proud to have such a wonderful lady on their staff! Much Thanks  from Lizz  Dave  and little Jacob! xxx;;;;;2016-07-21T22:46:46+0000;1469141206;2016-07-22 00:46:46;63;39;73;2;114;39;28;11;25;0;62;9;1;0;0;0;0

I came to the Coulby Newham store to ask for a refund in order to buy a laptop in working order from your store.   I WAS REFUSED A REFUND or EXCHANGE.   I have a receipt of sale with tesco and was told I cannot have a refund as the member of staff couldn t confirm if the item was faulty. I took copies of all email exchanges with tesco direct.   Completely appalled by your customer service.   I have asked tesco direct how I receive a refund or exchange and have had no reply.   Why are you making this matter so difficult and time consuming to resolve!   In short I ordered a next day delivery item on Monday  it arrived late  it s broken  I ve wasted my time trying to return it to store and am no closer to having a working laptop!

You told me you couldn t get me a replacement which was disappointing in itself. I asked for a refund as it broke and is faulty. You said you would send me a money cars with £15 on which is the value of the bath seat. You told me it could take 10 working days. 10 working days passed. I messaged you. You said you would get back to me. You haven t. I messaged you again. You haven t replied!  So you sold me a faulty bath seat  I took it back the store kept it for me ( they still have it). The store rung me and said they had one in. I went to the store and they gave me a potty ( it was a mix up but I had to travel to the store with two babies in the pouring rain to find they had got mixed up)  you promised a money card  it s not turned up  you haven t replied to my messages. Really really disappointed. I m left with no bath seat  no money  wasted journey and unanswered messages.

Last Tuesday I booked a delivery between 8-9pm which did not turn up. I called Tesco at 9.30pm to find out what happened  they told me the delivery was an hour and 20mins delayed and will be with me at 10.20pm. At quarter to 11 I called them to find out it was not coming at all.   I have a two year old who is poorly. I had only waited till 11pm for his milk and breakfast for the morning. I live in the middle of know where and know transport of my own  hence getting it delivered. I had to take my son out really early in the morning to walk a mile to the nearest shop for food.  I was given two options over the phone to one have it ordered for the morning but they would have to charge me £45.37 again as refunds take 3-5 working days  or cancel the order and again wait 3-5 days for it to be returned in my bank. I did not have £46 spare in my bank to order it again. Silly policy.  I was extremely annoyed but thought I have never had a problem like this with them before. Although my mum has had a fair few times. I ordered my shopping again due today. Tesco had given me £25 in vouchers for the inconvenience so I use them for the re-order of the exact same shop.   I have just checked my bank and the refund for the previous order of £45.37 was put back  but then I noticed £47.37 had been taken out by Tesco instead of the £25.37 it should be.   What is going on? I have been so patient and understanding that mistakes do happen but this now is just incompetence. I have been a Tesco customer for many years as I believe they are better than the other supermarkets in price and quality  but this is beyond a joke.;;;;;2016-07-21T17:19:47+0000;1469121587;2016-07-21 19:19:47;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

They re tasty  the right consistency and the flavour is awesome. (I know you re expecting a but  and there is one) But  the packaging  although i love the retro design and the spoon scraping along it reminds me of a street band i heard in South Africa  it is really difficult to get all of the soya goodness form out of the grooves. I tried using my tongue but a) that looked really bad on the train. and b) i could only get 1/3rd of it licked. I also tried a finger  which was a little bit more successful but as i licked 2ml of blueberry from my finger for the second time the man sat opposite me on the train stood up and went to sit somewhere else. The only solution i have managed is to add some hotwater and make a blueberry soya yoghurt tea  but i did not enjoy it and I was also told I could not plug my kettle in on the train.  Is there a reason for this specific design and would there be any hope of it changing?;;;;;2016-07-21T10:43:31+0000;1469097811;2016-07-21 12:43:31;29;10;39;1;50;9;3;6;44;0;28;1;0;9;0;0;0

I recently noticed customers at one of your stores leaving their dogs in cars in the scorching sunshine. I discussed this with the store manager and suggested that some posters at the entrance  promoting customers to give this some thought  might be appropriate. I even supplied him with several ofiicial RSPCA posters. He replied that he needed to speak to  head office  before he did this  and so far nothing has been done.  I think that you (Tesco) could and should take a responsible stance on this. I know that the good weather is good for your business  but surely a dead dog in a car in your car park  surrounded by police  RSPCA staff  public and the dogs owner isn t!?  I am struggling to think of a good reason why your store manager would have been refused permission from his superiors.;;;;;2016-07-20T16:59:22+0000;1469033962;2016-07-20 18:59:22;2;2;2;0;4;2;2;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I visited the store earlier today with my parents and sister. When we were in the refrigerated section there was a large milk spillage in the aisle with NO WET FLOOR SIGN. My dad turned the corner into the aisle and slipped on the spillage  falling and hitting the full length of the left side of his body.  Whilst customers gathered around to help my dad up and make sure he was alright  I went to get two male members of staff named Jason and Leigh who were decidedly less concerned about my dad. They took their time to even come to the aisle and neither asked my dad if he was ok. They did get a gentleman to come and mop the floor and put a wet floor sign down  which he then removed without even fully mopping up the spill! Neither Leigh nor Jason spoke to us at all after I had alerted them  and even when I told them they just said  “oh  sorry.” I was angry about this and mentioned to another member of staff that nobody had offered to even record what had happened  so he asked if I wanted to speak to a manager and went to get one. The manager who came to us made us wait about 5 minutes with nobody offering my dad a seat or checking if he needed anything. The manager was called Jamie and was the dairy  meat and poultry manager. I was understandably upset at the treatment so far and when I tried to express this he cut me off saying  “I’m just here to help.” He did not immediately ask if my dad was ok  and I had to again ask him if someone would record what had happened. He then tried to ring to record the incident and couldn’t get a response so he wrote a note and said he would phone it in when he could and ring us in the next 24hrs to confirm he had done that. He also kept calling my dad ‘mate’ which I thought was inappropriate considering the circumstances. Nobody asked if we would like to make a complaint and I feel like my feelings about your unconcerned staff and their blasé attitude to a very nasty fall were completely dismissed. Working in retail myself  I am aware of the procedures my own colleagues would take if such an incident occurred in our shop  and I am confident they would never treat someone so nonchalantly under these circumstances. I felt that the staff were not only dismissive and uncaring but also rude. Your staff should not be cutting a customer off when they are trying to explain why they are upset and they should certainly have made some kind of effort to ensure my dad was ok following the shock he had suffered. Quite frankly  I expect a better level of service than this from Tesco and feel that  whilst in your store  your staff ought to have a duty of care for the customers which was severely lacking today.;;;;;2016-07-20T15:43:23+0000;1469029403;2016-07-20 17:43:23;3;7;9;0;16;7;5;2;4;0;3;0;0;0;1;4;0

I spoke to customer services  and received a refund for £6.25  which doesn t cover the cost of the food tainted. And a five pound voucher for the inconvenience.

I have used this store daily over the years and have always been really satisfied with the service and products available. Due to work commitments I now don t get to this shop as often. Today my visit entailed standing in the middle of the shop trying to work.out where things might be  while the manager and other staff just walked by me  in my oast years there was always that friendly customer service where at these times you d hear  Are you OK there? Can I help?  BUT not today. Then.obbiously if you  like me  are on a diet but still would like a cake or desert of a low fat nature. YOU CAN T as tesco do one desert and no cakes! Such a shame when their larger store has the beat selection around. When I mentioned this to a member of staff she replied :the diet coke is in the Isle over there  and another said  we do fruit  obviously she hadn t seen  load of it in my trolly and fruit isn t the same as a cake is it? Also I wanted some small packets of sweets for a class I help out in l. Nope even though there is a school ten minutes walk away they don t stock anything like that the reply is  don t Wilkinson do them.  When I pointed out that as I run a small business myself I think it is appaulling that there is a market for these things as the children take them.in for their birthdays etc the persons face was blank.   I am so disappointed with what was a lovely small shop to have gone down hill over such a short time and not to stock things that are in demand in the area.   As I walked I out was spoken to by five people who said they have raised the same issues but it s a waste of time.  As a business woman it is hard enough to have customers come back to you time.and time again when they have to pay parking without not listening to them or worst still sending them elsewhere for things they want.   Tesco yiu have disappointed me and others by what I m being told.;;;;;2016-07-20T09:59:41+0000;1469008781;2016-07-20 11:59:41;1;6;1;0;7;6;4;2;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Whilst I have no issue with offer ends being changed during trade and understand the necessity of it I was highly embarrassed to listen to two members of staff spend at least 5 minutes loudly discussing their managers shortcomings and lack of organisational skills which prevented them from actually changing them. The conversation was very personal and highly inappropriate for the shop floor. I did not feel able to ask them what I needed as whilst I hovered to try and get their attention the conversation became more personal and made me feel very awkward. Then when I went to the self service tills I had to wait for a long time for assistance as two colleagues were engrossed in conversation the content and language choices again not suitable for the shop floor. The whole experience has led me to question the professionalism of your staff in the store.;;;;;2016-07-19T23:01:58+0000;1468969318;2016-07-20 01:01:58;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

After spending the best part of 2 hours yesterday morning shopping with my 1 year old  which isn t that easy  I arrived at the scan and shop tills  I had my shopping random checked and had all the tags removed from certain items to fine in horror that i had left my wallet at home. I explained the situation to the lady on the scan and shop tills and she was very understanding and took me to customer services. Again I explained that I had left my wallet at home and asked if I could get my wife to pay by card over the phone  only to be told that Tesco s CAN T accept over the phone payments. How in a digital age where people can order from the same store online and pay over the internet  can they not process a payment over the phone! I had to make a 50 minute round trip to go and get my wallet and return to get my shopping. Thank you tesco for wasting my time  I will be shopping elsewhere from now on!;;;;;2016-07-19T15:16:39+0000;1468941399;2016-07-19 17:16:39;1;5;1;0;6;5;4;1;7;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Well it s 11.47 and still not here.

I ve rang direct customer services twice who try to ring company but can t get through. Nobody rang me to say it was going to be late   It is still on system that its coming yesterday and is in progress. Someone rang me at 10 yo ask if id got it  i said i hadnt but no further calls.   I get my shopping delivered at least once a week and presumed it would be as reliable.  I regularly order from direct with delivery instore but unfortunately this wasn t an option.

To cut a long story short  we had ordered a Plum trampoline and when it arrived it was missing the bouncy bit which makes it tricky to bounce!   A replacement was supplied but it was missing the bouncy part again!!   Apparently we weren t the only ones to have had this problem with Plum trampolines. By now Tesco had realised the problem and had removed the product from the warehouse which meant we couldn t get an exact replacement.   Our son is on the autistic spectrum and struggles with disappointment more than your average child. Stephen took this case on and did everything he could to help. He emailed Plum to try and resolve the issue  and when they couldn t he suggested alternatives. He phoned me when he said he would  and kept me informed.   He has been helpful and friendly throughout and I thought it was important to let you know that I thought his customer care was excellent.;;;;;2016-07-18T18:45:53+0000;1468867553;2016-07-18 20:45:53;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Her exact words were  if you get stuck just give me a shout  That was a great welcome into the store!   My next stop was the Electrical Desk where I was served by one of the friendliest Retail workers I ve ever had the pleasure to meet! He was warm   friendly and totally genuine and I ll be honest he made me definitely think about choosing Tesco for other electrical purchases as his service was OUTSTANDING! I bought a few more items and went through self service where the attendant was also lovely!

I think his name is marios? He followed me around the clothing section whilst I was there and he made this very clear  for one if I was going to steal I think I would have taken at least a bag or a coat! I was in my work uniform and had a little purse with me! When I went to purchase my goods I spoke to a member of staff and told them he said he would have a word as he knows I m a regular customer and it s not nice so I thanked him and left. Last night I visited again and your security guard is following a mother who had several young kids running about like kids do he followed her to self service and the kids being kids made scanning her shopping that bit more difficult what probably didn t help the fact is that your guard followed her there and stood on the outside of the self serve one till down I say stood in fact he was bent over the rails! Your cctv would probably prove this! He really makes me feel like uncomfortable and as a regular shopper in your store I don t wish to be made to feel that way I d rather go elsewhere!

I have just sat down to my meal and the steaks are extremely tough. Not what I would have expected from your finest range. They were not overdone because I like them to be red in the middle. They have a lot of fatty bits in them and it s near impossible to cut  let alone chew. If I had known that Tescos  finest  steaks were this bad I would have bought one decent steak for more money... I have previously bought steaks from Aldi  and while I didn t expect much  they were lovely. So I will be going to them for steak in future. I wanted to let you know my disappointment.

However  the nine year implementation renders it meaningless.  So many more people are really thinking about the effects on other species regarding what they consume  nowadays that your nine-year implementation is already behind the times.  Vegetanarianism won t happen overnight but people are already looking for ethical ways of buying what meat they do eat and eggs are an important part of most people s diets.   The public are also becoming very educated about how eggs are produced and how the hens are treated and many of us are aware that even so-called  free range  are anything but.  We know those images of fields and hay bales are fiction  especially those of us that end up mopping up the mess at the end of this egg production by rescuing and nursing back to health the poor creatures from most of the factory farms.  I already don t buy store-bought eggs as I like to know I am not causing harm to the animal producing them but I am afraid I may have to desist from shopping at Tesco until a way may be found to discontinue the cage-produced eggs.  Other stores are leading the way in looking at more ethical - and healthy- produce and I do suggest that Tesco follow their lead sooner rather than later if it wishes to keep it s market-share.

We have a weekly delivery from Tesco and the drivers are always lovely. Especially the young chap i had back in March; With shopping due 9-10am hubby took kids on school run and driver was promptly here at 9.05am. I unlocked the back (our drivers always use the backdoor for ease) but i was struggling as i had only been home for a day or two  from a long stay in hospital. As we were chatting the driver asked if i was okay as he had only seen my hubby for the previous few weeks. I proceeded to explain my recent misfortune and he stopped me right there  ordered me to take a seat and unpacked all my 9/10 crates of food. He told me off -in jest - for not telling him sooner and made sure i was okay before he left.  I did call customer services to bring it to their attention as in all honesty i wouldn t hesitate to complain if i had a problem  making it only fair to give them praise when i have had a great experience receiving my shopping.  That small selfless act made my day and i will never forget his kindness.   Well done Tesco!! 😊😊😊";;;;;2016-07-17T17:45:40+0000;1468777540;2016-07-17 19:45:40;4;3;4;0;7;3;2;1;2;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Will now be steering clear of Tesco and advising everyone I know of the horrific bad service my brother experienced.  After his baby being born not breathing on Friday and his partner and baby now being monitored in hospital he is absolutely exhausted spending every minute either at the hospital with his new born daughter and partner or at home building cots and getting the house ready as his daughter was born premature.  Last night as baby and mum are due to come home today he went to Tesco after a long day at the hospital and spending all night rearranging and building furniture in the house at about 11pm at the Bedworth store! My brother filled his trolley with over £100 worth of shopping including cot sheets  non chemical baby wipes  nappies  food and other necessary items. He was there with my other brother and the two of them were rushing around when the 15 minute announcement went off to make sure they had got everything they needed for the arrival of the new baby coming home. He had pre scanned all his items in the hope it would make it quicker for the staff as he knew he didn t have much time. NO other announcement was made at the store closing so you can imagine his surprise when he got to the till to pay at 12.04. He was shouted over by a rude security lady who was sat watching the cameras (how malicious that she watched my brother running around tesco knowing they were closed and wouldn t let him buy his shopping  wow) the security guard said they couldn t buy the shopping as they had shut (4 minutes ago)  my brother explained his situation and as the security guard was rude and smug my brother asked for the manager. Well Tesco I think you should invest in some new managers.  My brother explained his situation and begged and pleaded he said he could pay in cash or on card of either was easier  the manager refused and laughed with the security guard at my brother (obviously getting some kind of sick enjoyment at a desperate and exhausted father) my brother has been through the most traumatic weekend of his life and was visibly upset and exhausted yet your staff were so rude and obnoxious and couldn t even do a humane gesture of goodwill. There was one announcement that you were closing and no others  my brothers we locked in the Tesco even though the security guard was watching the cameras. I understand you close at a certain time but 4 minutes with a trolley full of shopping visibly with baby things in there. After 20 minutes both my brothers left empty handed even though in that 20 minutes they could have purchased the shopping as it was pre scanned and even if it wasn t wouldn t have taken more than 20 minutes to scan through. Good to know after my brothers baby was born not breathing and him and his partner have had the most difficult and exhausting weekend Tesco couldn t have a little compassion for a desperate and exhausted father who was 4 minutes late to the till.  I would like to point out all the tills were still open.  Is this the reputation you pride yourselves on?!  My brother shops weekly at Tesco in Bedworth but after this won t be going back there to be treated awfully again.

We have been doing our weekly shop here for a few years now  but in recent months we feel the store has gone down hill.   Firstly  the best before dates on fruit and veg are often the same day or the next day and those with better dates seem to be of poorer quality versus this time last year. It also seems ironic that in spite of the shelf edge labelling claiming  best of British  we struggled to find anything that wasn t from Chile  New Zealand or South Africa. Buying British produce is very important to us.   Secondly  the levels of cleanliness are quite shocking. All around the store seems to be littered with discarded packaging and receipts and the floors in general need a good wash!  Finally  although the colleague at the customer services desk was very polite and friendly  the shop floor staff seem to be in need of some training! Many of the aisles were blocked with abandoned stock cages and trolleys from staff completing online shopping tasks. In addition to abandoned trolleys  one member of staff was charging around the refrigerator section almost bumping into me with no acknowledgment or apology for nearly causing a collision!  Unfortunately  we are seriously considering whether or not to continue shopping with Tesco. I hope these comments are taken into consideration  we just want the Tesco from last year back!;;;;;2016-07-17T11:02:59+0000;1468753379;2016-07-17 13:02:59;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

But when I call customer services an utterly unhelpful employee tells me that the driver is already back at base loading up his lorry with more deliveries and by no means will he be told to instantly return to finish my delivery. When I then speak to the manager and enquire where this tesco base is  it becomes crystal clear that someone at tesco is lying as the base is approximately 20 minutes from my house AND the driver made a further delivery after mine. It is logistically impossible for your driver to make it back to base in the time that I called! Clearly someone is lying at tesco!. I look forward to the result of your internal investigation. A helpful suggestion would be for someone to put their hand up in the air and say that they re sorry for lying! ....sadly  I fully believe that nobody will be brave enough to do so.

I ve just been in your store at Kingston park where myself and my family have witnessed your security staff being completely over the top with regards to customers who have just paid for their goods. They are watching people at the checkouts  who they can clearly see are paying and then immediately stopping them and asking to see their receipts before checking their shopping trolleys. According to your checkout staff this has been going on all day  much to their embarrassment. I ve never felt so uncomfortable whilst paying for my groceries. A woman on the aisle next to me paid for her goods and was watched doing this by a security guard and was stopped 6ft away from the checkout. It was completely out of order. Are the security staff somehow saying that your checkout staff are untrustworthy??? I felt compelled to approach the woman who looked clearly embarrassed and ask her to put a complaint in to the manager. It was then a member of your lovely checkout staff went over to ask this guy what the hell he was playing at. I m all for people taking their work seriously but come on  this is beyond a joke.  Now I thought this was the end of it until walking out we saw a young couple who were flanked by 3 security guards who accused them of having something under their coat and the man then had to shake his coat in front of them  and customers. It turns out they had nothing at all on them and they had been right to plead their innocence. It s a left a sour taste in my mouth how people can be treated in such a manner. We re frankly disgusted. We hope you address this matter. I m not expecting you to go in and start sacking people....but every little helps 😉;;;;;2016-07-16T16:48:31+0000;1468687711;2016-07-16 18:48:31;8;2;11;1;14;2;2;0;2;0;8;0;0;3;0;0;0

Undeterred I phoned tesco and after half an hour on the phone  I believed I had re-ordered my original order to be re-delivered today  I even paid again and had my payment authenticated. But no  once again my order has not turned up  so I phone yet again and get told there is nothing that can be done  no offer to sort it out  no offer to reorder for tomorrow  no  just some guy telling me there is nothing he can do. To make matters worse  I have just seen a tesco van go passed my house  which as I live in out in the wilds and get about 4 vehicles a day go passed  seems like rubbing salt in the wound. So no food for us this weekend  but what do tesco care  after all I ve only had 200 oh no sorry 199 orders delivered previously  obviously I m not that important to them.;;;;;2016-07-16T15:47:27+0000;1468684047;2016-07-16 17:47:27;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

As you can imagine I was very shocked and upset to be treated this way as I am a very regular customer and definitely not a thief  ! I made a complaint via telephone after and  Spoke to a manager called scott  who was lovely and apologised for how Id been treated   today I visited again (big mistake) I felt very awkward from the beginning but when my grandaughter and I go to the self checkout .. We paid for her two little pocket money toys ( she paid with the money for her own purse and Popped it into her bag) and lo and behold the same guy comes over and asks us if we had paid for our items ????? Ive made another complaint with management (Dan) at the store but he didnt seem at all concerned at the way Id been treated at the store it seems protecting their stock is of paramount importance as that s the only justification he could offer me !!He explained that there is a big shoplifting problem there but that shouldn t affect my visit it s not my problem as a customer !! Im so upset and angry again !! What the hell is going on with that store !!? Im just so shocked !! Really really shocked ...

Not an insignificant amount  so it was definitely a considered purchase. Unfortunately this morning the small button that operates the Fit Bit fell out. So I called at the store with the receipt and box. The response was  I was put on the phone to speak to someone at Tesco support who simply said sorry  you are out of the 30 day period  here is a telephone number for the manufacturer   they are open  between 9-5 Monday to Friday  thanks for your call goodbye. The member of staff at the store while pleasant enough simply said we ve just changed our policy to stop people taking advantage!  Now I understand the need for a process etc  and yes I am over the 30 days but what really disappointed me was the lack of any customer care. It really smacked of we ve had your money so you are on your own! So out of interest I contacted Argos to see what they would do.It seems that had I bought my item from them I could have  returned the faulty item to the store (despite the fact that I bought the item 35 days ago!) and they would either have exchanged it there and then or dealt with sending it back to arrange a repair. That to me is what you call a good after care service which gives you confidence in the retailer. When I bought this item from Tesco I very nearly called at the Argos store  that is across the way from the Tesco store  Oh how I wished I had. I definitely won t be making that mistake again. Where is your customer care Tesco... ?;;;;;2016-07-16T15:08:05+0000;1468681685;2016-07-16 17:08:05;2;6;2;0;8;6;2;4;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I saw a staff member who was polite enough to look with me but we discovered they were out of stock. Paying for my items at the self service  he came back up to me and said he spoke to a colleague that was looking upstairs for me (even though I had previously said not to worry)  he scurried off and in 2 minutes both men were back with playing cards...reduced to 8p! I couldn t believe it! He then said that I could just have them (I hope he doesn t get into trouble for this!!) After he assured me it was okay  I walked away extremely happy with wonderful service!

Been a loyal customer of Tesco Burgess Hill since it opened many years ago. Today I needed their help. So my husband calls them for me...We have an 11 week old baby and it s a blisteringly hot day. Tomorrow is his special christening day. My mum and I are catering for a party of 50 or more. The very last thing I need is 4 large freshly baked baguettes. My husband asks nicely if these baguettes can be baked ready for us to collect this evening in the hope that they won t be stale by morning. The answer we are given is a straight NO!!!!! A complete refusal to help in any way 😦😔 So we ask to be put through to a supervisor in the hope that we may appeal to their better nature....After all I must have spent thousands with Tesco over the years. After being kept on hold for a ridiculous amount of time no one answered so we had to give up. Clearly your moto of  every little helps  doesn t apply to customers of your main Tesco branch.

This-morning  I popped in to the Ballymena (County Antrim) store  and seeing as I had my toddler and 2 newborns with me  I proceeded to park at the Parent and child section of the carpark. Luckily  I was able to get a space in Parent and Child. My previous 2 visits I was not so lucky  which is stressful when you have young children to get out and in of your car!  My issue is  that although I was able to get an available space in this section of the carpark today  I noticed that a member of staff was parked in the first Parent and Child Space  just outside the front doors of the store.  The woman in question was wearing her Tesco uniform  and was packing her own shopping into her car. She did not have any children with her whatsoever  so shouldn t have been using a Parent and Child parking space. I took photographs of her number plate and of her getting into her car  which I will send privately  so you can identify this member of staff.  It really gets my back up when ordinary members of the public use these spaces when they don t need them  so I m sure you can understand how annoyed I am to see a member of Tescos own staff doing it! It seems that your staff use these spaces themselves  because they are so close to the door and they are obviously too lazy to park elsewhere.  Unfortunately  it s a regular occurrence at this store.  I think Tesco need to remind the staff at this store  that Parent and Child spaces are for the use of parents with children with them! 😠;;;;;2016-07-16T12:07:52+0000;1468670872;2016-07-16 14:07:52;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

This way when you pay you think you ve ordered all your items and paid one delivery charge but in fact you have only paid for the last item you added to your basket so you are forced to go back and order again and of course pay the £3 charge again.

I regularly visit your Ilminster and Yeovil stores both in Somerset. I can never park in one of the parent and baby spaces at either store. I see parents of 8 or 9 year old children using them - they don t need the extra space! No car seats or prams. I see lazy people using them with no children at all whilst I struggle with my 7 month old and sometimes have to leave him to the side in his pram while I move my car forward in a regular space just to have enough room to get him into his car seat. I d be happy to walk from the back of the car park just to have the extra space. Maybe that s where you should put the larger parking bays and it may stop the simply lazy people from using them!

You have notices up in all stores that state  milk helps dairy cows . This is a lie as you are know doubt well aware. In order for a cow to produce milk it has to have a calf. These calfs are separated from their mothers within 24 hours  causing immense suffering to both the calf and the cow. Both of which cry for days afterwards. Can you image what it would be like if we did this to humans!  Now think of how many cows be have in this country that are suffering in this way.  Once separated from the mother cow  the calf ( if male) is either shot or sent to barbaric veal units abroad. If female she will have to endure enforced artificial insemination and go through many many pregnancies. After only are few years they are classed as  spent  and are sent for slaughter. The few Bulls that are kept for breeding are forced to produce sperm via penile electrocution. Please take down all of these notices.;;;;;2016-07-15T08:20:01+0000;1468570801;2016-07-15 10:20:01;3;16;3;0;19;15;4;11;2;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

They state that “Every pint helps care for dairy cows .  On the contrary  every pint of milk contributes to the pain and suffering of dairy cows. To imply that milking cows helps them is just plain wrong: the milk industry is one of the cruellest and most exploitative in farming. At best these labels are misleading; at worst they are morally unacceptable and deeply offensive.  In order to keep producing milk for humans  dairy cows are consistently made pregnant. This is done forcibly  typically through artificial insemination. Calves are generally taken away from their mothers within 24 hours of birth  causing immense distress for both mother and calf. Both usually cry out for each other as they are separated.  Males  who are of little use to the dairy industry  are either killed shortly after birth or sent away to be reared for veal  while females follow the fate of their mothers – milked continually throughout their lives  producing 10 times the amount of milk they would naturally.  They are milked to such an extent they often become ill and contract painful udder infections like mastitis. They only live to a quarter of their life expectancy before their body gives up  they are considered ‘spent’ and then slaughtered.  These awful acts are unfortunately the standard  everyday practices of the UK dairy industry; the facts the industry tries to keep behind closed doors  conveniently out of sight. Through these labels you are masking the truth from your customers in order to sell more milk.  Stop selling a lie. Cows do not need milking and farmers are not doing them a favour. This campaign has understandably outraged thousands of your customers  who have taken to social media to express their disgust. Some are now boycotting the supermarket until the labels are taken down.  I request that you immediately either remove every one of these labels from shop floors or move them next to the plant-based milks  which really do help cows. Otherwise we will have little alternative but to register a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority.  Yours faithfully   David Shaw";;;;;2016-07-15T08:18:59+0000;1468570739;2016-07-15 10:18:59;5;2;5;0;7;2;2;0;0;0;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

I searched how to complain and started reading many complaints about the behaviour of tesco drivers. I was amazed that such a big company allows their staff to behave in such a manner  they can be abusive  aggressive  and rude  is it because they are alone and not being managed? lorry drivers are more curtious on the roads.  The man wearing mid grey sunglasses  driving  along Curzon Road Maidstone at 9:05 am was driving too fast  very aggressive  commanding me to move out his way   and has an extremely bad attitude  he needs sacking   I would not want him advertising for my company.  Tesco stop ignoring these bad reviews and and do something about it.  He told me you have speed tracking on the vehicle why not a camera.  every bad driver  delivering 10 times a day  1 bad incident is 1 less customer. should I complain to Teso?

Picture this - your son is turning 3 on the 15th of July  and has been desperate for a  big trampoline ... You manage to find a perfect 8 foot trampoline instore at tesco for £80  you double check online and see that tesco have an identical trampoline for instore collection for £10 cheaper  you go ahead and order it  feeling very happy that it will be ready for collection for the 14th  and you saved yourself a tenner win run... You plan to collect and set it up that evening ready to surprise said 3 year old on the morning of his birthday... You collect the trampoline and when you go to set it up you find that the box says (1/2) uh oh.... It s 9pm  you rush to tesco to sort this error out and collect the missing package  only to discover it is missing!!!!! You inform them of the identical trampoline instore but you re sent away on the promise that a manager would call you within the next 10 minutes to sort this all out  you leave stressed and worried! You get a call back and told that there isn t much that can be done due to the fact it was an online order  you tell them that considering there is an identical trampoline in store that you re sure (given Tesco s  every little helps  motto) that they can help rectify this error tonight to ensure a child won t have their only wanted birthday present missing when they wake up?   NO - this is where the disappointed (to say the least) comes in  you re then told that this would need to be passed to the night manager as its coming up to 10pm but are promised a call back as soon as its passed to him  time ticks on and by 10:30pm getting increasingly frustrated you call the night manager to be met with him not knowing much about the situation and the only thing he can repeat is that NOTHING can be done!!! He slips in that no one is trained on the click and collect desk after 10pm and this is the reason  realising you were in about this whole mess BEFORE 10pm you are left very angry and upset  met with no empathy or understanding you have no choice but to hang up and face the reality of letting your son wake up on his birthday with his longed for present missing due to TESCO s incompetency!!!  I am clearly very upset and angry at this situation and feel social media is the only avenue I can access at this time.  I d love to hear a response!

I had a bag of sweets that I picked up and headed upstairs to the clothing  where I picked up some pyjamas I wanted to buy.  I went to the cash desk  there was only one person on the till serving and a very very slow moving queue.  The staff - Sharon was her name  I found was proving to look like she didn t want to be at work at all. No customer service  no smile  nothing!  Once it got to my turn  after waiting about 20 minutes  she just took my items and scanned them  then made a comment about the sweets I had put on the desk  you re not meant to pay for these here it s got to be downstairs  but I ll do it today  in the most monotone voice I ve ever heard. And also  there is no sign in the store stating that I couldn t pay for the sweets upstairs. With this being said - there was a man before me in the queue and he had purchased milk and oranges and nothing was said to him!  I am pretty disappointed in the service today and has put me off visiting your store!  Nothing like service with a smile!👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽;;;;;2016-07-14T17:47:15+0000;1468518435;2016-07-14 19:47:15;0;4;0;0;4;4;2;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I purchased a few items at the self service machine and the lady that was working really needs a lesson in customer service. Our machine alerted that we needed help and she casually strolled past a number of times not paying attention at all. In the end my husband had to walk up to her to ask for help. We finally got her attention however there was absolutely no sign of a smile and she didn t speak one word to us at all. I don t know why you employ people who obviously don t want to be there or why you believe this is a good way for your customers to be treated. Very disappointed!

This should have arrived today. I paid £31 more than other companies were charging plus the delivery fee to Tesco as you were the only company offering next day delivery and I need the item by Saturday. I arranged for somebody to be present today to take the delivery. Mid morning I received an email from DPD informing me that although they were due to deliver to me today they could not as they had not received the item from Tesco. I phoned Tesco and was inform that there is an ongoing problem with DPD and that she believed they are currently running 24 hours behind schedule. She could not confirm if DPD do have the item or if Tesco still have it  nor could she tell me when I will receive it. So as it stands I am around £300 out of pocket with no idea when I will receive my item!!!

He then gave the same reaction to my Royal Bank of Scotland note and said I ve never seen one of those before. What a £20 note? Train your staff! This might reduce the lengthy queues building up behind people like myself and reduce the embarrassment of having to ask your staff to call on a manager to verify that my hard earned money is not fake or fraudulent.

They state that “Every pint helps care for dairy cows .  On the contrary  every pint of milk contributes to the pain and suffering of dairy cows. To imply that milking cows helps them is just plain wrong: the milk industry is one of the cruellest and most exploitative in farming. At best these labels are misleading; at worst they are morally unacceptable and deeply offensive.  In order to keep producing milk for humans  dairy cows are consistently made pregnant. This is done forcibly  typically through artificial insemination. Calves are generally taken away from their mothers within 24 hours of birth  causing immense distress for both mother and calf. Both usually cry out for each other as they are separated.  Males  who are of little use to the dairy industry  are either killed shortly after birth or sent away to be reared for veal  while females follow the fate of their mothers – milked continually throughout their lives  producing 10 times the amount of milk they would naturally.  They are milked to such an extent they often become ill and contract painful udder infections like mastitis. They only live to a quarter of their life expectancy before their body gives up  they are considered ‘spent’ and then slaughtered.  These awful acts are unfortunately the standard  everyday practices of the UK dairy industry; the facts the industry tries to keep behind closed doors  conveniently out of sight. Through these labels you are masking the truth from your customers in order to sell more milk.  Stop selling a lie. Cows do not need milking and farmers are not doing them a favour. This campaign has understandably outraged thousands of your customers  who have taken to social media to express their disgust. Some are now boycotting the supermarket until the labels are taken down.  We request that you immediately either remove every one of these labels from shop floors or move them next to the plant-based milks  which really do help cows. Otherwise we will have little alternative but to register a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority.  Yours faithfully  Monique";;;;;2016-07-14T05:34:56+0000;1468474496;2016-07-14 07:34:56;8;6;8;0;14;6;4;2;8;0;7;0;0;0;0;0;0

Vegan cheese  vegan Quorn and vegan falafel wraps can be bought in many Tesco stores.  It does  of course  also cater for the vast majority of people who have few or no qualms about eating animal products.  Almost all vegans started out as meat eaters so we understand from direct personal experience the  see no evil  hear no evil  speak no evil  mindset that insulates the consciences of meat eaters from the underlying horror of animal farming.  We understand  even if we do not approve of  Tesco s inevitable participation for the time being in this evil.  However now Tesco have taken this a step further and invited their customers to consume cows milk on the basis that  Every pint helps care for dairy cows .  This is worthy of Josef Goebbels!  The dairy industry ranges between cruel and diabolical.  It s objective is not to make life good for cows!;;;;;2016-07-13T21:48:15+0000;1468446495;2016-07-13 23:48:15;7;5;7;0;12;4;3;1;8;0;7;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have used this store for many years and whitest it s not my favourite place it is local. Since they have introduced Shop and Scan I have practically been in there every day.   On Sunday I forgot to scan six bottles of Cider and they have now banned me from using it. I did tell the assistant that I think I had forgotten to scan something and to check and when she scanned to approve the alcohol I told that was it. At no point did she tell me it was a problem so I didn t know until today when I tried to used it again.   The staff in the store was not helpful at all and said  we cannot help you in the store . This seems to be the standard line for all complaints.  Eventually I got to she the manageress Wendy who unbelievably said this seems like not the first time it s happened. I asked for them to substantiate this claim because it was completely untrue as I have used it every day had many random checks and all has always been ok. She said she didn t have to justify it and it was their discretion to refuse it use.   So I did my shopping at ASDA where I I ll from now on.   I will be taking this further with a request for information on data shared about me and have already complained about it to your customer services.   I await a full apology and acknowledgements that the statements and actions where inaccurate  inappropriate and unjust.

They state that “Every pint helps care for dairy cows .  On the contrary  every pint of milk contributes to the pain and suffering of dairy cows. To imply that milking cows helps them is just plain wrong: the milk industry is one of the cruellest and most exploitative in farming. At best these labels are misleading; at worst they are morally unacceptable and deeply offensive.  In order to keep producing milk for humans  dairy cows are consistently made pregnant. This is done forcibly  typically through artificial insemination. Calves are generally taken away from their mothers within 24 hours of birth  causing immense distress for both mother and calf. Both usually cry out for each other as they are separated.  Males  who are of little use to the dairy industry  are either killed shortly after birth or sent away to be reared for veal  while females follow the fate of their mothers – milked continually throughout their lives  producing 10 times the amount of milk they would naturally.  They are milked to such an extent they often become ill and contract painful udder infections like mastitis. They only live to a quarter of their life expectancy before their body gives up  they are considered ‘spent’ and then slaughtered.  These awful acts are unfortunately the standard  everyday practices of the UK dairy industry; the facts the industry tries to keep behind closed doors  conveniently out of sight. Through these labels you are masking the truth from your customers in order to sell more milk.  Stop selling a lie. Cows do not need milking and farmers are not doing them a favour. This campaign has understandably outraged thousands of your customers  who have taken to social media to express their disgust. Some are now boycotting the supermarket until the labels are taken down.  I request that you immediately either remove every one of these labels from shop floors or move them next to the plant-based milks  which really do help cows.   Yours faithfully   Lauren Robinson";;;;;2016-07-13T16:54:31+0000;1468428871;2016-07-13 18:54:31;10;11;10;0;21;10;2;8;1;0;10;0;0;0;0;0;0

I spoke with a very helpful young man on the phone but the only information he could give me was that the cardigans must have just gone out of stock and the next delivery is not due for a further 4 weeks. If I ordered these  when available  they will not arrive for the start of our next school year  18th August.   I did look into buying non-embroidered from your website but these do not come in royal blue  knitted and there is no option to purchase a non-embroidered jersey cardigan.   I find this absolutely unacceptable as the same situation occurred last summer and our school were informed that this would not happen again this year  clearly not true!

They state that “Every pint helps care for dairy cows .  On the contrary  every pint of milk contributes to the pain and suffering of dairy cows. To imply that milking cows helps them is just plain wrong: the milk industry is one of the cruellest and most exploitative in farming. At best these labels are misleading; at worst they are morally unacceptable and deeply offensive.  In order to keep producing milk for humans  dairy cows are consistently made pregnant. This is done forcibly  typically through artificial insemination. Calves are generally taken away from their mothers within 24 hours of birth  causing immense distress for both mother and calf. Both usually cry out for each other as they are separated.  Males  who are of little use to the dairy industry  are either killed shortly after birth or sent away to be reared for veal  while females follow the fate of their mothers – milked continually throughout their lives  producing 10 times the amount of milk they would naturally.  They are milked to such an extent they often become ill and contract painful udder infections like mastitis. They only live to a quarter of their life expectancy before their body gives up  they are considered ‘spent’ and then slaughtered.  These awful acts are unfortunately the standard  everyday practices of the UK dairy industry; the facts the industry tries to keep behind closed doors  conveniently out of sight. Through these labels you are masking the truth from your customers in order to sell more milk.  Stop selling a lie. Cows do not need milking and farmers are not doing them a favour. This campaign has understandably outraged thousands of your customers  who have taken to social media to express their disgust. Some are now boycotting the supermarket until the labels are taken down.  We request that you immediately either remove every one of these labels from shop floors or move them next to the plant-based milks  which really do help cows. Otherwise we will have little alternative but to register a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority.

I came in to send off two parcels from the post office concession you have in the store. The one parcel wasn t wrapped as I couldn t find anything for it to go in  so I approached a young man in a suit and asked if they sold any. He searched all round store for me but unfortunately he couldn t see any. He then walked me all the way over to the post office at the back of the store (stopped what he was doing) and told the lady behind the counter what I was looking for.   When I approached the lady behind the desk Tina  I joked with her that I was going to be that  nightmare customer  and she continued to joke with me and was so cheery at 10am on a Monday morning! She then went on to search for a bag / box for me to put my item in. The young man who I originally approached continued to search too.  She eventually found something for me  and at no extra cost she helped me wrap my item and sort out my paperwork. At the same time she just chatted away to me and showed genuine interest in what I had to say.  As a customer service manager myself  I d just like to say what an absolute asset Tina is to your store (and the young gentleman who helped too). Her customer service is outstanding  and never have I felt so valued as a customer. Usually I would pop next door to Saintsbury s as I generally find it cheaper  however from no on I will be a loyal Tesco shopper  as service like that needs to be recognised and rewarded.   I really hope that you pass this on to Tina and reward her as a company yourselves  as she is one hell of a lady and if everyone in customer service was like her then the world would be a better place! I bought her a box of chocolates to say thank you - the first time I have ever done that based on someone s service.  You should be extremely proud to say she is a member of your team.  Thank you again Tina  and thank you Tesco for employing someone so fantastic! Keep it up!!

Whilst I understand that paying a  fair  price to dairy farmers is something many people care strongly about  this is a gross misrepresentation of the fact that Tesco aim only to support farmers  profits  and not to care for cows.   How could an industry which requires cows to be repeatedly impregnated  only for their newborn calves to be removed  killed and grieved for by their mothers  possibly be described as  caring ? Please remove this lie from your shop shelves. If you must  replace it with a slogan about giving a better price to dairy farmers  but please do not try to portray the physical and psychological torment inflicted on millions of dairy cows as  care .   By the way  I d like to thank you for having a great range of dairy free yoghurts  cheeses and milk for those who do not want to support the cruelty of the dairy industry!;;;;;2016-07-12T20:35:10+0000;1468355710;2016-07-12 22:35:10;21;0;21;0;21;0;0;0;0;0;20;0;0;0;0;0;0

What a disgusting and deceitful statement. Every pint of milk seals the tragic fate of female cows  who are artificially inseminated  give birth to babies that are stolen from them to be sold for veal  babies that they literally cry and wail for the loss of. They are genetically manipulated to produce unnatural amounts of milk that cause their udders to swell a hugely uncomfortable amount  resulting in infection and indescribable pain and discomfort. This cycle of abuse goes on and on until the poor creatures are too mentally and physically exhausted to continue  and when they are no longer a profitable commodity with nothing to exploit  they too are sent to slaughter like the precious babies they ve spent their lives mourning.

The text below stated ‘If it’s cheaper at Asda  Morrisons or Sainsbury’s  we’ll take the money off your bill at the till’. It also featured a character holding an icon that carried the text ‘Brand Guarantee’.  The small print  however  stated: “Minimum basket of 10 different products  including one comparable branded product. Total price of branded grocery shop compared with Asda  Morrisons and Sainsbury’s and if cheaper elsewhere the difference will be taken off your bill.”  The ad was investigated after a complaint from Sainsbury’s. It argued that the ad did not make the minimum purchase restriction sufficiently clear and challenged whether the claim “Never pay more for your branded shop” was misleading. my wife today went to Tesco in pontardawe swansea in order to buy a product which was advertised cheaper at another well known supermarket but was unable to do so as Tesco deliberately misled the public in the advert which is explained above  all I can say is goodbye Tesco and cant wait for the big new LIDL supermarket to open as I feel this will spell the death knell of Tesco pontardawe;;;;;2016-07-12T14:26:35+0000;1468333595;2016-07-12 16:26:35;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Upon checking them when I returned home  one of them was faulty and I then noticed they were also locked to Tesco Mobile  which I wasn t aware of. I took them back to a store and discussed how I would be refunded  by speaking with Tesco Direct on the phone. We agreed the best way forward was to issue me with a voucher for the amount of the boost  as the phones were a present for my twins  birthday  which is this Thursday 14 July. This has now been an ongoing issue because instead  Tesco decided to award me in points on my next statement  which of course is no good to me.  Upon telephoning numerous times to be told you have emailed me the voucher / to BT Internet not accepting Tesco emails (which is rubbish) / to be told I will get it the next day and not getting it  I have finally spoken with Peter Richards user NS02  who very kindly managed to sort out the issue for me. HOWEVER  due to the aforementioned incompetence on your behalf  there ARE NO PHONES LEFT IN STOCK 😡. I am extremely angry because you have left me in a position where I will have to physically pay for a phone elsewhere  which was the whole point using the boost  so I would only have to purchase one  when had you have sorted out the issue immediately  I wouldn t have to. It is their birthday on Thursday so thank you Tesco.  I would like to know how you are going to rectify this situation for me please.

I just thought I d mention something I saw in your Borehamwood branch on Saturday night  in the hope you ll organise some hygiene talks for your staff.  As I was making my way to the tills I walked past your sandwich fridge  opposite the newspaper stand  and was stunned to see one of your employees scratching his bottom.  And I don t just mean a little itch on the side  he was really getting into the crack and having a good old rummage around!  He then reached out to touch something on the sandwich stand.  I was absolutely shocked and sickened to be honest  and even more surprised that it didn t occur to him that it was unacceptable.  The fact he didn t even seem to care that people were around suggests this is a regular thing.  I didn t feel able to go up and speak to him about it  so please  can you deal with it and talk to your staff!  I really think they d benefit from a few hygiene lessons! If you want times so you can look back at CCTV just let me know and I ll check my receipt when I get home.  Thanking you.;;;;;2016-07-12T10:03:23+0000;1468317803;2016-07-12 12:03:23;0;5;0;0;5;5;3;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Thanks for all the beautiful messages  prayers  likes  calls  lunch dates  presents and visits.  I appreciate everyone that has taken a moment to celebrate me. I want you all to pray for Matt a cool guy that works at Tesco Highwoods Colchester.  This is how I met Matt who was a true gentleman going about his job at Tesco.  I went to get my prescriptions and I was also looking for some insecticide spray.  I saw Matt and asked him where I could find the spray  he gave me the direction and then decided to hold my basket which had my handbag  two packets of muffins as I was also using my walking stick. He asked if I had anything else to do while I was there and I said I wanted to pick my prescriptions from the pharmacy.  As we walked to the pharmacy   I asked for his name and he said it was Matt. He then said to me that he can go and get the raid insecticide for me while I waited at the pharmacy to save me the journey. I said that was very kind of him. I told him he just made my birthday just easier and special due to his attention and generosity to me.   Guess what? Well Matt came back with not only the insecticide but a birthday cake he had paid for and he gave it to me and wished me happy birthday.

What s the policy on opening food on the way around with a toddler? I always pay for it and if it s something by weight  get the sticker first. Also had to buy a tomato one day (no one in the house likes them) because she picked one up and buy into it :o Just wanted to know because I don t want to get in trouble  buy it is preventing a loud protest which would upset other customers I think.

I haven t seen this in any other store so if it s a local initiative the person responsible should be commended.  My son was worried that at 10 he was too old until a 75 year old man took 2 plums for himself!

I still want to voice my opinion regarding a mobile phone contract I have with yourselves.  I have had a contact for 2 years and no issues so I upgraded.  The upgrade arrived the 19th of may 2016. A few days ago that phone started to fault. Upon researching it is and is and a common fault with a certain batch of the phones. I rang to explain this and nothing would be done until I had factory reset the phone. The only options I was given if this didn t work was to send the phone back to the manufacturer which would take a minimum of 2 weeks and this was justified stating I would be reimbursed the contract monies paid for the time the phone isn t in use. By the consumer rights act it is your job to make sure the phone I have purchased from yourselves to be fit for purpose. I have looked on the citizens advice website and I am indeed eligible to request an exchange. I phone again to express my feelings and hopefully mobe forward and I am not given a direct answer except blame to the manufacturer who are apparently the only people who can sort my problem-  only when I mention the CAB do I get anywhere. I am then offered a refurbished phone which will only be sent when the current phone is received back. Fair enough  however I again will be approx 2 weeks without a phone.  This is my only communication device- no landline or anything so if my 2 small children need the doctors or anything during this 2 weeks i cannot call them to get them an appointment  if worse happens I can t even ring 999.  I explained this in the previous phone call and was asked if I  could borrow one from a family member- again no use as I can t and even if I could my sim isn t compatible.  The bag will take 3-5 working days by post which I have to bare with it being faulty.  If I post it immediately who knows when it will arrive  then there is the processing time plus another 3-5 working days for the refurbished phone to arrive.  So not even 2 months in to my contract  only 1 bill paid for the remaining 22 months I will be paying a certain amount in full (as per your broken down bill) for a refurbished phone- not what I signed up for!  As I have said to the customer service representative on the phone  if this were a microwave - no matter the manufacturer  if it were still in warranty I could take it back to your store it would be replaced with another or a microwave of equal value  no quibbles.  Overall  very unhappy regarding the outcome and inconvenience this was cause and it being justified with you at some later stage reimbursing me monies  for the inconvenience.;;;;;2016-07-11T11:09:39+0000;1468235379;2016-07-11 13:09:39;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The young lady  Jess  serving me was great and was serving me with a professional attitude. She was going through your returns policy with me when another lady  I assume in her late 50s early 60s with short dark greyish hair interrupted her and said word for word  Don t worry Jess  those fire sticks are not coming back because people like that put programs on and sell them . I was in a bit of shock at how rude and unprofessional she was and labeling me as  people like that . What are  people like that  exactly? and why am I being labelled? And why would I sell them when anyone can get them?  Well you have now lost a valued customer as will be doing my shopping in Asda in future.

At the time I also purchased the 2 year insurance cover and was told that this covered my tablet for 2 years.  Since then my son unfortunately dropped his tablet and the screen cracked. We sent it off via square trade and the screen was replaced. At no point was it ever made clear to me this is where my cover ended. When I purchased with hudl no one told me if you get it repaired before your 2 years is up then the cover finishes and I m not covered.  So yesterday I rang square trade again as my hudl screen has again cracked  to be told that my repair last time exceeded my limit and I wasn t insured. If I was made aware of this after my last repair I would have insured my sons hudl as he is only 5 and accidents happen.  So how do you suggest you rectify this lack of customer service?

The 1st tub only had 280ml in it   and the 2nd tub only had 285ml in it ?? when it clearly states on the side of the tub 300ml ?? i had to nip out at 10pm to our local shop to purchase some more as the tubs were short ! Is this normal practice to underfill the tubs   in my case BOTH of them ? my recipe called for 600ml exactly   A bit annoying when i assumed 300ml in both would be exactly what i required . My scales were correct as all my other ingredients were correct . I am so cross   as if this is the case in every tub   then you are deceiving the public ?? 300 should mean 300 NOT 280 or 285 ! a very annoyed customer !!;;;;;2016-07-10T22:16:36+0000;1468188996;2016-07-11 00:16:36;1;3;1;0;4;3;2;1;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

They had one member of staff who had to lock up the Click and Collect unit and walk over to the store for each customer and then bring back the items that were chilled. This caused us and the other customers more problems waiting around and then deciding what we would risk taking or exchanging. We had ordered through Click and Collect to save time  so to wait around for over 10 minutes was not the greatest idea. Why couldn t they send another member of staff over to do this?   The problem was made worse by the derogatory response from the Customer Engagement Centre ! After a few emails sending back and forth  it appears that Tesco really don t value our custom enough for me to bother trying to reason with them. Maybe I should start driving past the entrance to my local Tesco that I have been visiting for over 20 years  to get better service somewhere else.

Just wanted to express my complete dissatisfaction with your letter of response following my return of 2 bags of pest infected pasta  purchased at a Dundee store. While your apology was appreciated  there was no explanation or reason given for the beasties I found in the sealed bag of pasta  and no promise to get back in touch to let me know the outcomes of any investigation.  The ladies I spoke to when I returned the products were visibly disgusted by the state of my pasta  and genuinely horrified - I cannot fault their service and attempts to resolve the complaint  but I asked them to mark the complaint as  not resolved in store  as I thought I would get a more thorough response from you  but sadly your letter gives no more information on the cause of this issue than they could.  The £10.00 gift card with your letter was also an interesting gesture  especially since it wasn t even accompanied by a refund for the dodgy pasta. I ve had more compensation for a screwed up online groceries order and would have thought that were less of an issue for your company than contaminated food products? So  thanks for your letter  but you can be assured that it has in NO WAY reassured me that pasta products bought in your stores are safe to consume.

I called on Thursday to see if you had a certain medication in stock for my (really quite unwell) 9 week old son. I was told it wasn t in stock but could be ordered and would be in store in a couple of days. The staff member took my son s details  along with my contact number  and said somebody would call me when the meds had arrived.  I called today to check if it was there yet  as it had been 3 days  and the staff member that I spoke to advised she could see no record of the medication ever being ordered  and said that she could order it for us tomorrow.  The fact that the staff member I spoke to on Thursday simply didn t bother to put the order in is unacceptable. From the details that she took she could see how young my son is  and surely by the fact that the medication needed to be ordered in specially  she could see that he s very unwell.

Please would you find out if it is worth you paying more and maybe running a line of milk that is  Fair Pay to British Farmers ?

Someone came out and said they couldn t bring it out because it would sound the alarm and left her there. She had to call me in a panic to go and help her. I get there 15 mins later to find the customer on his hands and knees still trying to sort her scooter out. Someone else came along and offered to push her back to her car which she accepted.

You have clearly identified this as the growing market that it is  and you are addressing this demand. However you are also risking loosing customers from this growth market with your latest suggestion that buying dairy milk somehow improves the lives of dairy cows. This is not true; the only thing that would improve the lives of dairy cows is to stop the endless cruel cycle that every one of these creatures has to endue  against their wills  to provide milk for human consumption. Your policy of paying dairy farmers a fair amount is good but this will only go to improving profits for the farmer not improving the lives of the cows.";;;;;2016-07-09T14:03:56+0000;1468073036;2016-07-09 16:03:56;2;0;3;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;2;0;0;1;0;0;0

I want to thank again this wonderful lady who gave such a lovely  simple but amazing act of kindness to me today that I was reduced to tears in the store car park!  I have 2.5 yr old twin boys who absolutely refuse to get into twin trolley seats so they walk with me. Normally they re very good  but this afternoon  as soon as we got into the store (I was on my own with them)  they both descended into the most almighty melt-down. One was running one way  the other was running another way  whilst I was trying to push a trolley.  She approached & asked if there was anything else I needed. She went to get that for me whilst I tried to scoop my screaming children from the floor. She then got another member of staff to open a till straight away so I could pay & leave to see to my boys. She packed my shopping for me  whilst trying to talk to & help calm my boys the whole time. She managed it with one of them. She then pushed my trolley to my car whilst chatting away nicely & holding the hand of my one calm child  leaving me free to try to control my other one. Once at my car she loaded my shopping into my boot whilst I got my boys into their car seats. Once they were safe  I thanked her for being such a star.  She said it was no problem  & that we had all been there. I told her I felt like I wanted to hug her & she said  Oh come on then ....& so she hugged me...& I was in tears in Tesco car park  struck & overcome with the relief of the situation & the kindness of this person.  For anyone who is a mum of multiples  this will undoubtedly strike a chord  but I m sure it would with most people too.  In many ways  it wasn t much that she did  but in so many others  it was so very much more than most would do.   This lovely lady  & those like her need to know that what seems a simple & straight forward act of kindness  can not just make someone s day that day  but it can make their weeks & months better  because we don t forget that there are people like this.  And to anyone who has ever seen someone struggle like I was today  & who have felt embarrassed or unsure of how to help; do it anyway. It will be hugely appreciated & restores faith in humankind.  Thank you so much to Sharon. She deserves good things. Please share this post far & wide so she has a chance of seeing it. Thank you all x ";;;;;2016-07-09T11:36:43+0000;1468064203;2016-07-09 13:36:43;5;2;5;0;7;2;1;1;0;0;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was meeting some old friends for a meal and then having a movie evening in. A standard Friday night for a poor student in a town with little to no night life. On our way to the movie evening we stopped off at our local Tesco (Sidwell street - Exeter). Again  a standard night.  As I and my three friends left the store one of your security guards came to say goodbye. A nice gesture - yes but he didn t actually say goodbye. He came up to me and said  Having a good evening Serena Williams  I saw you on the court today at Wimbledon?   I feel I should pause here and let you know a fact about me. I m black (well  mixed race) and my friends are white (not a big deal - but important context). Racism is never something I ve really come across - it s something I ve always seen as its shown in movies  people being told that they can t go somewhere or do something because of the colour of their skin BUT that s not the only kind. It s casual everyday racism  like the throwaway comment I ve mentioned above which is the most prevalent in society.  Comments and comparisons to famous people  yeah that s nice and all. I m sure many would say it s a compliment but  and here s another fact about me Tesco  I m nothing like Serena Williams.  She s athletic and sporty  my only form of exercise is walking to the fridge to get my latest ice lolly. She s 34  I m 21. Let s be honest the only comparison is that we re both black. If you want to see and make your own further comparisons I m more than happy to send you a photo of me so that you can draw your own conclusions.  In all seriousness though Tesco  and I know it s been a fairly jokey message so far. Whilst the security guard might have meant it as a joke (and I m almost sure that he did) it s these throwaway comments which contribute to the everyday racism which people encounter. I m not someone to complain about this kind of thing Tesco but I thought it was something I should bring it to your attention. Whilst offence was certainly not intended I feel the above is a point which could be mentioned to your staff.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter.  Best wishes  Katie Shodimu;;;;;2016-07-08T22:03:15+0000;1468015395;2016-07-09 00:03:15;5;6;10;0;16;6;4;2;2;0;5;0;5;0;0;0;0

She was one of the rudest people I have ever dealt with. When she found a manager and spoke to him he listened to our side of the story and said that the lady would be dealt with  however I don t think this was the case as she walked away smirking! Now im not saying my friend wasn t in the wrong  he ran up the travellator. (However He does have ADHD) I don t think this calls for him to be called pathetic!

There is clearly a huge need for some further training for your staff in PR.   I hope very much that you are in the process of learning from what has been said and how you have approached the situation.  Veganism as I am sure you are aware  commercially if no other way is a growing ethical choice amongst consumers for many reasons; whatever an individual s circumstances and reasons  their choice saved a great deal of suffering and makes a positve environmental impact.  Can I please urge you to look at how you engage with us as vegans? Can I also ask that you consider how your marketing team works to enhance your sales  there is a disconnect and it needs some work.

In the last couple of months I ve felt very despondence with my local store in Sheringham NR26-   My daughter has been so bullied at secondary school to the point were she started cutting herself having full on panic attacks she became very withdrawn it wasn t an easy time.  As a family we decided to move schools which has changed her back to the child I know and love.  Her grades have gone from bottom sets to top sets within 6 months.   Myself and my daughter are very happy.   We shop at are local Tesco s very day for bits and bobs and a weekly shop on top of that too.    The group of young youths have started hanging around inside the    foray on a bench (group 8/12) at a time.  Every time there all together they Hackel myself and daughter which makes me feel intimidated and I can t explain how it makes my daughter feel.   I ask once for the group to be removed as I didn t feel safe leaving the store.  The security guard and girls behind the cigarette counter was brilliant but they called the cashier manager over so he could ask the youth to move on.  He was very dismissive over my fear but because the other staff could see my distress the security guard moved them on.   I then went in on a Sunday morning early to try a catch the cashier manager to have a chat about how the youths are hackling spitting calling us names and how I felt uncomfortable in distress when there hanging around!!!!!!  He was very dismissive told me I was the only person how felt threatened or upset by there presents.  He was walking away from me as I was trying to talk to him in circles wouldn t give me eye contact I felt he didn t care about a loyal customer.  He said   he wasn t willing to keep asking them to move as it was harassment against them!!!   I asked about them harassing myself and my daughter.  He told me   it was my problem and no one else had complained  I questioned this and he got angry with me and said he would call the local police.  Then walked away.  As you can imagine how upset I was and disgusted by the way the gentlemen had doubt with me.   I was at the self check out he came back over to me saying there not out there and my reply was I didn t say that!!!  I told him he was rude and wasn t a very good manager as I felt he should of taken me to a quiet spot in the store taken a statement from me and my telephone number he didn t like that to much.  I also told he after the was he had treated me I would never shop in Tescos again until the situation with the youths hanging around inside the store was doubt with..... Yes he walked away lol   I have found out tonight that he lied to me regarding any other complaints may people have done so with very similar fears of the antisocial behaviour.     I can t shop in my local Tesco s anymore because of the fear of being harassed by antisocial behaviour.    I believe the cashier manager let myself and my daughter down by not doing his job correctly.  I have written this with a heavy heart as over the years I ve enjoyed shopping at Tesco s but can t shop at my local store anymore...

A few days ago I went to purchase a gazebo priced at £129.99 (not on sale ) I couldn t remember my password so couldn t complete the purchase.  Today I went online to buy it and saw that the gazebo was now £50 off  bargain it will only be £79.99 now. How mistaken was I when I saw the price is now £149.99 reduced from £199.99.  The price is infact £20 more than it was before the sale!!! Tesco informed me that it is a company that sell through Tesco Direct and can set/amend prices as and when they want and Tesco take no responsibility for the blatant misleading price hike this sub company have added at the point of going on sale. I did get a sorry which obviously makes misleading the public acceptable.  Well done Tesco another customer service gold star.;;;;;2016-07-08T15:53:22+0000;1467993202;2016-07-08 17:53:22;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Not only does the form ask for a lot of unnecessary personal details but also the address bit is not working so I couldn t continue. Firstly  unusually for Tesco  the store is one of those places playing stressful and unpleasant piped music. Secondly  I queued up with my 2 items but the checkout assistant sneezed on her hand so I had to go to one of those self-service tills. The assistant seemed somewhat surprised at my (polite) comment. I am currently suffering from yet another virus respiratory virus caused by this type of source with poor hand hygiene knowledge. It is about time you trained staff at all levels in basic hand hygiene. There is a similar problem with a couple of the staff at your Berwick on Tweed branch.

I have never got so stressed in my life. I Realise Fridays is a busy day but having to contest  with your food carts as well down every isle was a joke. I couldn t  even get down some isles as there was two blocking the route. I counted about twenty carts out if not more. Surely this is not the best time to start restocking shelves. It seriously needs to be scaled down. Every time I visit the store all the staff do is chat amongst themselves and not acknowledge the customers there is no eye contact at all. Seriously I am not one to complain but it s bad. Also I stopped at the customer service for something tried to make pleasantries and the woman just smirked and carried on talking to her colleague  about what she was doing the weekend. I work for one of the largest chain stores and I am shocked at the way your store is run.

My boyfriend and I had purchased an item that needed a security lock removing and the female cashier (very polite and great service) asked her colleague for assistance removing it. Instead of assisting her in a professional manner he made several sexist comments about women not being able to think and do things for themselves. When I said that his comments were inappropriate he tried to drag my boyfriend into agreeing with him  which because he isn t a troglodyte he did not agree with. He continued further ranting about how women can t park cars or drive and upon paying for our items he turned to my boyfriend and said that he hoped that I wasn t driving! It is not professional to speak to a fellow colleague in that manner and it is not acceptable to speak to a customer as such either. Sexism is not banter and the cashier did not deserve to be publicly demeaned. I am sure that he does not represent what Tesco stands for.;;;;;2016-07-07T20:24:10+0000;1467923050;2016-07-07 22:24:10;1;2;1;0;3;2;2;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

As I was waiting to pay a man walked in very giddy  happy and with a huge smile on his face  shouting loudly to greet the staff and laughing to himself. The man clearly suffered from some kind of mental health.. Every single staff member smiled at him  greeted him and knew his name... Then a staff member came from behind the desk with a massive smile on her face and said  you ve got me today  picked up a basket and took his shopping list from him and off they went! I asked the cashier was she helping him with his shop and she told me she was  each time he comes in someone will help him ☺️ i know this is probably a Tesco promise (value) or even just expected of the staff team but to be so enthusiastic about helping him was so heart warming.. I know giving 100% great customer service all the time can be hard  everyone has their own problems at home  the weather isn t great today and we all would rather be at home with our feet up but this staff team made him feel like he was the only person around  special and loved. They all were talking amongst themselves about how he cheers them up and makes them smile 😊  I d love this staff team to be recognised 😉 a little treat for their work 🙏🏽 today is a good day!

I had went to the garage this morning  and whilst I was hoovering the car I allowed my 2 year old son to  drive . After putting him back in his car seat and shutting the door  I came to the horrifying realisation he had managed to lock the door with my keys and phone inside! My son quickly became very distressed and hot locked inside the car and I felt completely helpless. A very kind gentleman offered his help and went to retrieve a member of staff  in the meantime I managed to talk my son through opening the door. The female member of staff (I didn t grab her name) offered lots of praise to my son  who by then was lapping up the attention whilst I was in floods of tears! Out of her own money she bought my son some crisps  sweets and a drink and offered me a cup of tea. It may only seem like a small gesture  but she managed to turn a potentially distressing situation into my son thinking he was the bees knees! She is a credit to you!;;;;;2016-07-07T12:05:39+0000;1467893139;2016-07-07 14:05:39;6;1;6;0;7;1;1;0;0;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;0

I always buy my icing from the Express store on Stanley Road 5806.  The store is brilliant  I told them which ingredients I used on a regular basis and they always stock the items for me  this also included margarine  jam and icing sugar.  Whenever a new manager took over I made sure the roll out icing stayed in stock.  So far the icing has been discontinued around 10 times and once again the store got it back in stock.  Last week yet again it was discontinued  so once again the staff said they would get it back in  with it being my busiest time I also asked for additional two boxes. I have gone in today only to find the store is on locked down on range management until week 24  that s 5 weeks away.  They could not even order the two extra boxes which is needed today. I am now having to run around giving up my time to get icing which should have been in the store Tuesday/Wednesday.  I always thought that Tesco was there to help support local businesses and I know this is not the case.  I thought you would have been glad people are loyal customers  I am now having to re think because I cannot be let down by you again.;;;;;2016-07-07T10:03:58+0000;1467885838;2016-07-07 12:03:58;0;5;0;0;5;5;2;3;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I insisted that I can based on your TOS. He agreed although he made me feel guilty for doing so. Please clarify that I am indeed within my rights and if so PLEASE educate your staff so that customers are not forced to accept items that are not the same price when they checkout. In my case the prices was way above than what it was advertised as the promotion may be over. I shudder to think what I had to pay for if it was my mom accepting the order.

Just spoken to tesco direct regarding an order/delivery. apparently it is my mistake that I only provided one phone number and that they have rang to re arrange delivery this is my work number and they have organised it with someone who answered the phone? They assumed it was a home number and that the person answering had the authority to do this? Obviously on the second delivery  as I had no idea  the delivery driver turned up and someone rejected the order? As my property is a flat they have not gone to the right place I was to blame again  for not givno the correct Address either? I now have no order and they won t reinstate it or honor the boost points as this was done in May? both operator and manager were very rude unhelpful and blaming. I did give  the flat number as I have checked this.

I took in a prescription which had two items on  two packs of the same tablet. I was given one at the time and told they would order the second pack as it wasn t in stock. Two weeks later (and numerous visits back and forth to the pharmacy to try and collect the ordered tablets) and I was finally told that there was a manufacturing problem with the tablets. I was told to make another appointment with my GP to get a new prescription for the remaining tablets! So not only will I be wasting a GP appointment for a prescription that has already been prescribed I will also have to pay again for the new prescription leaving me out of pocket!  I was never told that both items were not in stock  just handed one pack and told to come back for the others. Had I known I would have gone elsewhere.

He made the order on Sunday 3rd July order number 4BKDWHPMG for 5 shirts and the order was processed and payment taken with the advices that they would be available in store to collect on Tuesday 5th.  He attended the store at 5.30pm today to be advised that only 1 had been sent as there was no stock left. At no time when placing the order was he advised that stock was in short supply and it seems strange that this was neither flagged at the time of the order or why full payment was taken when you were unable to complete your part of the sale process. This is yet another example of poor customer service from Tesco which I didn t believe could get any worse but you are consistent in your inability to even provide anything approaching an acceptable level of service. Why even once the order had been placed was he not contacted to advise you were unable to fulfil the order and a full refund made? It would have been better to not send any shirts especially as he had made a special visit to the store to collect them at considerable inconvenience to him. This also put your staff member in an unfortunate position which is unfair to them and although she was apologetic could not provide any suitable solution. Your processes are clearly designed for the benefit of Tesco rather than the customer and clearly your operational directors and managers do not have one iota of how to review processes to make them fit for purpose. The level of incompetence in all aspects of Tesco beggars belief and I am surprised that your profits have increased in the most recent quarter albeit by a  only paltry amount. He has now taken his custom elsewhere.;;;;;2016-07-05T17:56:27+0000;1467741387;2016-07-05 19:56:27;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

They have no idea of the fines which can be levied against the member of staff  not the company. And they have no idea it could lead to a dismissal.  And as for the manager who stuck up for his member of staff by saying her decision was final  again well done. You cannot overrule a member of staff in this way without having him or her second guess every single alcohol sale after that  and this is where alcohol is sold to the wrong person  as they no longer have the faith in their own judgement if overruled.  100% well done;;;;;2016-07-05T15:13:17+0000;1467731597;2016-07-05 17:13:17;10;1;10;0;11;1;1;0;1;0;9;0;0;0;0;0;0

My brother in law had finished his shopping and had gone back to the car.  I however was being served by a lady who took objection to the fact that the mop bucket I was trying to purchase did not have a bar code on it and I refused to go upstairs to the home and wear department to get another one for her to scan.  Once she had managed to get another one  she was extremely rude and unhelpful.  She did not tell me the price of my shopping and did not hand me my receipt ( I had to lean over and get it myself)  Once I had finished my transaction I waited around in the store so I could make a complaint about this.  I finally left the store being told that the matter would be dealt with and I am sure it has been.  Due to all this  by the time I got back to the car we were 5 mins over our parking allowance and my brother in law has been sent a parking ticket.  I am really annoyed at this as if your staff were not rude to customers there would have been no need for me to have been in the store so long.  I trust that you will be able to get this sorted out for me  as a £40 fine on top of staff being rude is not good customer service.  Thanks;;;;;2016-07-05T13:48:58+0000;1467726538;2016-07-05 15:48:58;1;3;1;0;4;3;2;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Over the past 2 days we have been to the desk 5 times and every time while serving me or my boyfriend they have been talking amongst themselves.  (fine before serving but during is just rude)  The worse occasion was when my boyfriend was asking for some scratch cards and one lady interrupted him to talk to a lady returning from her break I mean literally turned and started having a conversation while he was mid sentence.  He did say to her it was very rude and she said sorry but her excuse was she was signing her in on the till but that was not the case.  Seeing as my boyfriend works as a deliver driver for Tesco he knows how important good service is and we both expected better from front of store staff.

I looked at the ingredients and saw sugar  dextrose (more sugar)  cornflour  potato starch  rice flour etc which all turn to sugar in the blood stream.

Every Monday I run a twins/ multiple birth group and stop off on route to pick up snack for the children (usually around 30 little mouths to feed) with my own twins in tow it can sometimes be a bit of a mission but Tesco Bletchley seam to be getting it so right at the moment making this little errand an enjoyable experience for us all. Yesterday I was able to park in one on the parent and child bays and easily locate a double trolley (esssential but very rare! I often have to search or move numerous single trolleys to get to one which is a mission and a half especially if I need coins to do this!) Tesco Bletchley have a designated area so I know exactly where to go to get one. Three different memebers of staff said good morning as we entered and then we were approached by another who asked if we knew about the free friut scheme  We did  but he also gave us a tip to take one of the fruit bags to put the rubbish in! I hadnt previuos through of this and have often wondered round with a handfull of orange peel or banana skin. The fruit scheme is a fantastic idea  not only does it promote healthy eating but its great to keeping little ones occupied and happy whilst shopping. My two now ask to go to the  fruit shop  if I say we are going shopping.  Once we had finished I was putting the twins back in the car and was approached by another member of staff who had come to take the trolley (and my little bag of friut peels). Thank you so much  its the little things that just make the day that bit easier and keep everyone smiling.;;;;;2016-07-05T10:08:31+0000;1467713311;2016-07-05 12:08:31;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I rang Tesco and they emailed the partner because the company isn t open at the weekend.  I felt very annoyed because this needn t have happened and I couldn t have an instant refund.  I ve had plenty of delicates arrive intact  and those that haven t have been packaged properly anyway.  I put a very angry but factual review on the item site  only to have this  moderated   i.e. removed  even though it did not breach any guidelines.  It was suggested that I might want to write something else.  Well  I did want to  in response  but what I wanted to write would definitely not have been within the guidelines.   I replied to the email saying that I was not going to give any more reviews if they couldn t cope with a true opinion.  Although it didn t appear to be a  no reply  address  it apparently was  which made me even more annoyed.  So here I am to say that I will never  ever ever ever  waste my time doing another review for Tesco.  Some people will be quite relieved to hear it  I ve no doubt.

I noticed it has 1g of salt per pizza and you claim this is around 17% of the salt intake... but for an adult.  My daughter is almost 2 and I know this is 50% of her salt for the day  but it s an occasional treat and her diet is within guidelines (plus she never eats the whole thing!) but I consider myself a well educated individual who can make this informed choice. Considering on the back of your packaging it states it s designed for children would it not help parents to make a more informed choice by at least using the salt content of a child in the age bracket for which this product is being aimed? Or is it because your colour coding for  healthy choices  couldn t remain orange if you had to account for the younger age? I m not condemning the product (as I clearly buy it myself) but I do feel it is somewhat mislabelled nutritionally; there are some parents who rely on those colour coded labels to help them make good choices and I think they re being misinformed. Thanks for taking the time to read my comment.";;;;;2016-07-04T20:03:16+0000;1467662596;2016-07-04 22:03:16;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Why is it that every time I buy your food online the meat and fish is either a day or so until it needs to be used and the fish is always off? Iv been so put off by this that I have no choice but to shop online else where. I can t be the only one who has experienced this? I shouldn t have to have the produce that nobody else wants? the fish is always in date but every time I go to use it it smells rancid making me think your food is stored in sub standard conditions?

Hi Kay   I’m really sorry to see that you’ve found a sharp foreign body in your Mediterranean Grains; I can understand your concerns  though I would like to assure you that we can resolve this issue for you  though it will require you to return to store at your earliest convenience if you can?  My colleagues were correct in advising you to return to store to fill out a health form  as the store are best placed to send off your packaging  and sharp object for further investigation by our technologist and supplier; we cannot initiate the process without the packaging and sharp object in our hands  therefore this is why you were advised to do so.  Returning to store will give us the best chance at ensuring that the batch isn’t jeopardised on a wide scale  and you will receive a refund at our customer service desk  and will also be given a reference number which we would greatly appreciate if you could provide to us once you’ve popped into store.  The next step would be that you’d receive a written response from us in 14 days.  I hope this helps clear things up  though I do understand the inconvenience this causes  and I am truly sorry.  Please let me know if you have any further questions in the meantime and I’ll be happy to assist.  Kind Regards  Rob – Customer Care Thanks for your response Rob.   I m a little perturbed to be honest. Firstly  I subscribe to a delivery service with Tesco as I currently do not have a vehicle. I rely on a Tesco Express store for  top up  items.  I could have been seriously injured if I had swallowed this piece of metal and yet Tesco is expecting me to go out of MY way to rectify this situation. I would have to get two buses to the store or a cab at £16 return. Other than that  it would be an hours walk.  Considering I work full time and have a family and commitments  I feel that it is a little unfair that you want me to put myself out in such a way  when I have done absolutely nothing wrong!  Regards  Kay  Hi Kay   I completely understand your frustration. Unfortunately without you returning to store we will be unable to investigate. However  I would still like to make sure you aren t left out of pocket. If you could reply to this Private Message with the following details  I d be more than happy to send you a refund via Tesco Moneycard.  -Your full name  address and email -A picture of the barcode and dated area -The price you paid  Would it be okay to pass your details on to our supplier? They may want to contact you directly about this.  Thanks  I look forward to your reply.  Kind regards  Tiffany - Customer Care Hi  I didn t buy the product from the large store (as explained  I purchase your delivery saver). I bought it from the Express store which is in my road!!!

I went into store around lunchtime to do a weekly shop grabbed a hand held scanner as I always do. I changed my mind on using this.(not realizing the uproar it would cause)  I finished my shop went to a checkout where the lady said oh u have a scanner I said it s ok we didn t use it in the end. The lady had called another member of staff a runner called George he asked very rudely why I hadn t used the hand held scanner I said I had changed my mind in using this he said to me when customers take a scanner and do not use them we ban them from using scan and shop from our store?!?  I thought he was joking but he continued to say this and asked again why I hadn t used the scanner again I said I had changed my mind. I explained I wasn t aware of the rules of Tesco and nowhere does it state if u take a scanner and don not use it you will be banned from using this service in your store this maybe a  tesco  rule but I wasn t aware of it.  I was so angry packing my shopping I said to the lady who served us I was fuming with the customer service I was given she did apologize and for the way he spoke to me. I am 17 weeks pregnant and definitely did not deserve to feel angry about something so small.  Going forward I think something needs to be said to your customers as I shop here more than 3 times a week and  I m sure many customers are unaware of this  rule   as I was.;;;;;2016-07-04T14:53:48+0000;1467644028;2016-07-04 16:53:48;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Such a massive help and very greatly appreciated. We raised lots of money to buy new play equipment for our brand new community centre!

We were over 30 minutes late in collecting our  click & collect  order due to traffic.   There was a mobile number on the door of the hut which we called and he said  I ll be straight there. I kept apologising and he was so professional  said  don t worry   asked if we d had a nice day  held the trays so we could unload into our car. It wasn t until I asked him what time he finished that he told me 4pm and by this time it was about 4:40pm. I said you should have left our order  it was our fault. He response was  I couldn t go home knowing you didn t have your food  in the best condition. It s no problem at all. He was positive and smiling all of the time. A huge asset to the store.

Once again reported.....I got my £1.40 back for my measly mouthful of ribs I received but overall I m left feeling like Tesco really don t give a monkeys.  What s the point?

I want to go on my break.  That is an actual quote of what the member of staff said to me. I m absolutely disgusted  that a) there was nobody available to take over said staff member s shift so that people could continue to use the services and b) there could have been nicer and politer about what they said and worded it differently. I felt so under pressure printing my photos that I didn t bother printing  the majority of the other photos I wanted to print because I felt so uncomfortable and rushed. Would I go to a restaurant and get told to hurry up and eat my food because the staff wanted to go home? I think not. What s this all about Tesco? Not on at all.

I rarely have need to complain or take stuff back but today I decided to. I d bought a bunch of peonies which is a luxury item and waited for them to open   unfortunately after a week they hadn t but still looked healthy so topped the water up and waited....After 2 weeks they hadn t open and started to die. I know in the grand scheme of things this is small and insignificant to tesco or the world but to me a bunch of flowers brighten my day up when I need it.  So I took them along to my local tesco and explained what had happened- the manager was very fixed and ridged in the fact that they are only guaranteed for 5 days- I tried to explain that I understood but wanted to give them longer to bloom but he wouldn t move on his decision to replace the purchase. so I left the dead peonies in his bin and walked out to do my shopping else where  very upset at the reaction I got.  Kind regards Leisa Orme;;;;;2016-07-02T13:22:01+0000;1467465721;2016-07-02 15:22:01;0;4;0;0;4;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Unfortunately  my online order that was due for delivery this morning has been canceled due to the total amount of my groceries being £2.60 under my voucher total  at no point   at the point of purchase did your online system ask me to reduce the number of vouchers prior to completion and pay the difference! I paid a further £3.40 as instructed to finish the sale and I was given an order number and my time slot confirmed.   This morning I received a call at 0838 and again at 0901 from the local Tesco store who we re supposed to be delivering my goods stating   that the payment has not gone through do you have another card we could use? I explained that I d used my vouchers to which they said we have no clarification of this and that I would have to call customer services myself to resolve this  do you have another card we can use??? I said no   as I m not prepared to pay twice  she then told me to call customer services to which they basically said  they would refund my vouchers and I would have to place the order again  but not a delivery if you want the goods today  you would have to click and collect! She also said to make sure that your total order is under the total amount when using my vouchers and then pay the difference  again!!!   They then called me back stating they have looked at my club card account to which they have confirmed that my vouchers have been redeemed at store and can t understand why they haven t completed the order  they also said they can t reimburse my vouchers now so they will have to email me an e-voucher for the total amount of £57.00  My question to you Tesco is: Why doesn t your system do this at the point of sale? I m now without delivery at home with two kids  I m still £3.40 out of pocket because of this error... It s not the £3.40 that I m bothered about   it s the lack of customer service at the store  they couldn t be bothered and they were not interested  apart from asking for alternative payment details!   I may have to rethink where I spend my money on groceries in the future! Shocking....;;;;;2016-07-02T09:33:41+0000;1467452021;2016-07-02 11:33:41;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Yes  wonderful...Happy Shopper!  However  it had to be ordered online on a public use screen thing with a card and would cost £2.00 to have it delivered so I could trail 8 miles to collect it.  Needless to say I left disappointed and a little frustrated. Why can t cash be used to order items in store and delivery charges for collection from store????;;;;;2016-07-02T08:46:27+0000;1467449187;2016-07-02 10:46:27;0;5;0;0;5;5;1;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have suffered a recurring skight skin irritation that has been dormant for over a year. Tesco waterproof plasters are ideal for keeping the treatment on. Cannot find these at another competitor store sadly. Decided to visit the IRLAM EXTRA store to stock up. Last year  the staff inability to gather the stray trolleys resulted in one being blown into my car causing almost £200 of damage which your compsny neglected to refund. This morning at 905. There were at least 30 strays that I counted. I highlighted this to two members of staff One was a very young duty manager  the other a trolley supervisor who told me he was not starting til 930. The duty manager told me it was not his role. Well... It us the manager s role to step in to staffing gaps is it not?. Today s visit has done nothing to win me back to doing my £100 weekly shop  £60 a week petrol and pharmacy custom. Very poor service. Do you have anything to add?;;;;;2016-07-02T08:42:43+0000;1467448963;2016-07-02 10:42:43;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

If there is a problem and you need it fixed or refunded  you will get the run around saying that you must go through the company they got it from and its not there problem because they are just a web portal for third party vendors. I just wonder if you brought a carton of milk and it was sour should you have to call the farmer or maybe even have to contact the cow directly. In the future I will not be shopping with Tesco  and anyone that asks me about shopping there I will be glad to tell them to shop elsewhere.;;;;;2016-07-02T08:25:02+0000;1467447902;2016-07-02 10:25:02;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

So I buy alot of tesco s products and I m shocked that your company fails at the most basic thing s.   Let s start with tesco s bank  You don t accept your own bank cards at your petrol pumps! What the hell is that all about! if anything there the only cards you should accept because there the only cards you will know you will get the money from 100% and not only this but due to what ever limitations have been put on the bank cards this also stops them being used in places like a post office which is a massive inconvenience when I have to drive all the way to tesco s to get cash out just to go back to the post office to buy gas.  Tesco s stores  Now where to start with this! more than a few share of your staff don t have the basic understanding of customer service! and the third party company you have hired for security need to wind there necks in!  (Ie  tonight I was doing a small shop which time I had finished getting everything I wanted all the tills were closed  which I had a small trolly full to the brim and I went to the self checkouts and the member of staff there went up to another customer with a small basket and offered to open up the till for him leaving me having to wait after I scanned half my items for him to put a pin in the machine because I couldn t put all the items on the weight section of the machine. Which clearly he should have stopped me the second I walked into the self scan area which the staff normally do if I go in there after 11pm.)  Which this is just a small few things I ve picked out which quite frankly makes me to question why I have any services off you or go to your stores.;;;;;2016-07-01T22:24:23+0000;1467411863;2016-07-02 00:24:23;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Not only did we get a full refund  tesco paid the £18 difference to exchange for another style of bed (as an apology for the inconvenience)  and it was arranged that the broken bed was collected the same day the new bed arrived. This minimised disruption for my four year old son. Thank you tesco for your amazing customer service. 👍;;;;;2016-07-01T17:11:15+0000;1467393075;2016-07-01 19:11:15;9;1;9;0;10;1;1;0;1;0;9;0;0;0;0;0;0

Well today my mum  visited Litherland Tesco. Were her shopping came to £29. When she proceeded to pay. My mums card was declined  no fault of her own. when it did the Check out assistant Humilated my mother telling everyone in the que  Shes got no money in her bank and laughed . Little did the Check out Assitant Know  There is money in the account. There is a problem with the card. What gives your checkout asstiant the right  to discriminate my mother like that?   As my mum had no cash on her and the bank card not working had no option but to return to her car and cry her eyes out  Do you think that is acceptble Tesco? its ok your checkout assistant must of thought so she had a great day  she had a laugh at someone elses expense.  After crying and the humilation wore off  My mum lodged a complaint  With your Customer service team over the phone. got to hand it to you  your Customer service team on the phone was secound to none. Amazing! and restored a little bit of faith back in to my mum.  But since doing our weekly shopping in tescos Litherland since it was opened. for my mum to be offered a mear £10 to say sorry is not going to cut it.   My mum is so embarassed to walk into litherland Tescos again. NO CUSTOMER SHOULD FEEL THAT WAY.  Work this out. £100 a week x 52weeks = £5200 year on average we spend at Litherland Tesco. i wonder if Asda  Iceland Foodss  or Aldi UK  Would like our money instead. Would you treat a customer like that ?;;;;;2016-07-01T15:30:19+0000;1467387019;2016-07-01 17:30:19;0;9;0;0;9;9;4;5;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

They said they would replace it but I must return the faulty item within 30 days. Next day a replacement radio was delivered to my home together with  a free returns label. in Aug last year I purchased a Dashcam through Tesco Direct. Recently it started to give problem so I contacted the Tesco Customer Services and was told incorrectly that I should return it to the manufacturer for repair. Despite reminding them several times that my contract was with them and by Consumer Law they should organise repair/replacement I was firmly told it was not their responsibility. Luckily the manufacturer was helpful and to save further hassle I sent it to them at my cost of £4 50.

I ordered a couple of dresses and a top (for choice) from F&F online on 16th June for an event on 18th.  Website clearly states next day delivery for click and collect but apparently  it can take up to 48 hours for Aberdeen  - of course  because we are sooo remote up here!  I was actually sitting at the event when I got the text and email saying the items had arrived so next day I toddle along to the store thinking that maybe I will keep them anyway  only to be told on arrival that the parcel is not there!  At that point I said just send it back when it turns up and I can get my money back.  I wrote a complaint and was contacted by someone very politely apologising and I felt a little better about the whole thing.  That was until yesterday when a message was left on my phone telling me my parcel is ready for collection!!  I tried to call back without success so I called the customer service line again - and was told that they will wait 14 days before returning items from the store.  So it wont be returned until tomorrow (or possibly Monday depending on when they ACTUALLY got the delivery) and the refund will be processed once the items are back with the warehouse.  So let me get this straight - Tesco have had my money since 16th June (I checked my bank balance) and I have had nothing??  Worse still  despite saying to send it back  they keep the parcel for 14 days and I wont see my refund for some time yet??  The only part of this whole process that was simple was the ordering and paying the money ... nothing has been as it should have been since I clicked confirm order!  Can t see me ever bothering with Tesco online again - or Tesco in general if this is  customer service .;;;;;2016-07-01T13:39:14+0000;1467380354;2016-07-01 15:39:14;4;9;4;1;14;9;7;2;1;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Apparently there is new discounted stock making its way to the shelves  so I went to ask yesterday. The guy at the desk told me  I quote   yes mate  we have it on delivery but I am not allowed to sell it until tomorrow . So I went to the store this morning at 5 to 6 waiting for it to open. Then straight to the desk asking for that same product. The customer service agent checked for me but guess what - none in stock  none in delivery.   So it seems like the only ones to actually get the benefit of discount items are the tesco employees. Unacceptable.   Speaking about the Salford extra store. I m definitely not going to shop there again.;;;;;2016-07-01T06:06:10+0000;1467353170;2016-07-01 08:06:10;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0
