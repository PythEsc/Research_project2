Had a text earlier with  sincere apologies  that my delivery would be late. Two hours late and still another 45 minutes until my new scheduled time. Forcing people to stay up late is crazy. We have a young baby and no doubt will be woken up by her early so waiting up for my shopping is ridiculous. Let s wait and see if my shopping actually arrives or even if I get anymore details from tesco. One text isn t sufficient to keeping the customer informed. Especially when no reason is given!!! No wonder I stopped using tesco before. Wish I d never come back;;;;;2016-03-31T20:58:22+0000;1459457902;2016-03-31 22:58:22;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Your website stated up to 30minutes for both emails  one confirmation and one with the voucher to be delivered. We decided to wait until the morning of going to check on the weather  ordered at 8.15  conformation email came through at 8:18  waited (whilst checking) until 9:20 before calling. Got the car and children packed up ready  and would like to point out that myself and husband had taken the day off work. Then told on the phone that the website is incorrect and it can take up to 2 hours! The lady on the phone checked to see if this could be accelerated only to be told by the support team that there is a delay and that the vouchers can take up to 4 hours now due to system traffic. So I had everything  including the children packed in the car  and 2 options  ruin everybody s day by saying that were not going and waste a day off work or pay out over £100 for us all to go!  Thank you very much Tesco for false advertising  upsetting me on a rare day off  delaying our day and losing me money  as had I not have been using the clubcard points we would not go or mention this to our children as we cannot really afford to pay out over £100 on 1 day but now have no other choice!;;;;;2016-03-31T20:51:01+0000;1459457461;2016-03-31 22:51:01;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

As a Christian country why are we losing our Christian values? The Easter egg symbolises the stone from the tomb rolling away when Jesus rose from the dead.

We had a delivery booked for between 12 & 1 today. We waited until 1.30 & then called to find out what was going on - no contact from you. We were told it would be up to 45 minutes late. This meant we went without lunch as that was coming in the delivery. We waited another hour & still no delivery.  At approx 2.40pm we had had a call saying that our delivery had been delayed & would not arrive until between 5.30 & 6.30pm. This was totally unacceptable as we eat dinner at 6.30 & it had fresh food to be cooked for tonight s meal  a fresh chicken salad requested (a family tradition) by our daughter for her birthday meal this evening. We have been told there is no way to prioritise our delivery & offered a maximum of £15 as compensation. This would not even cover the price of the meal we have to now go out & buy elsewhere  let alone compensate messing up our youngest daughter s birthday lunch & also risking her birthday dinner.  We have been loyal Tesco customers for several years but due to this we intend to go elsewhere in future & will be cancelling our delivery saver option & hope you will not make that difficult too.

However  i was told i could not have a credit note but could exchange the £20 instore there and then for items of that price  but not for groceries. I was  allowed  to include a few items of groceries but no more than that - everything else had to be from the electrical dept. I asked what to do as i didn t want to spend £20 on electricals and was told to return another time when i did want to spend £20 but still could not have a credit note. I ended up buying a few items of groceries and 2 DVD s to use up the money - which i did not even want to buy. I was pressured into buying them there and then as i could not have a credit note - even though that s what customer services do for those without a receipt usually - and I was effectively  told  how to spend my money instore.

What happened to your sensible priced delivery slots. I used to shop with Tesco all the time but the last 3 times i have looked to book an online delivery slot it has been 4 or 5 pounds unless i want it delivered late at night which due to a health condition i cannot. The last 2 shops i have done have been with another supermarket that delivered for £2 each time which maye not sound much of a difference but it adds up. Please don t take this as a complaint I am just bringing it to your attention. My husband is able to drive so can use Tesco frequently but health stops me from driving which means i rely upon a good value delivery service. I hope you all have a good day  and i hope you do not mind me bringing this to your attention.;;;;;2016-03-31T08:58:00+0000;1459414680;2016-03-31 10:58:00;2;9;2;0;11;9;4;5;6;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Well when the audio on the TV I bought from you less than three weeks ago stopped working I certainly told my 9 people  but I will happily tell more than 9 people (well however many will see this actually) how very impressed I am with the customer service of your employees in dealing with the return on the tele. I rang the store to make sure it was correct to return to them they directed me to the electrical helpline  5 minutes later I had a returns code  an apology for the inconvenience and wished a Happy Easter.   When I arrived in store with me & my mum carrying the boxed TV one of the in store people came and took it off us and asked where we were going & then took us to the returns desk at the tech team. About 5 minutes later the refund was issued  no quibble and we were thanked for our custom and wished a good day.   When the sound stopped I dreaded a long & drawn out returns procedure  presumed I d be fobbed off to the manufacturer & messed round having to send it off to be assessed on whether it was fixable or just to replace/refund but my experience was very much the opposite.   Thanks  Tesco. You made the whole experience much more manageable  well done.

I am a  trans male and I was in galashiels tesco when I needed to use the toilet. It is hard to use the toilets as a trans man as I am afraid of being discriminated for using the men s.  I went to the customer service desk and explained my situation. The woman at the desk told me not to worry and I can use the men s.  While I was washing my hands I noticed a man come in and walk back out. When I came out I noticed the man was a security guard who pointed out it was the men s toilet. I explained why I used them and he said I should use the ladies. I told him I was told I was allowed and he told me to wait while he spoke to her. I got impatient and went to the desk where the lady said she thought I was taking my son into the ladies toilets.  She said she misunderstood me and was not listening properly when I said I am trans male and I want to know of the toilets are trans friendly. I did not mention a son  I don t even have a son. They advised I use the disabled toilets  I said I wasn t disabled and they pointed out it s also for people who do not have a visible disability.   I am not disabled and I am appalled that the lady at costumer services lied to the security guard about what she told me. I left the store humiliated as I was confronted in the middle of the doorway to the men s toilets in front of people wanting to use it and was asked by one what the problem was also the woman lying to protect herself. If you are not trans friendly then say so as it s hard enough I have to sneak in mens toilets to avoid confrontation and now I have been put in that situation out of coawrdness from one of your staff.  I am man therefore I should have access to the men s toilets without a problem.;;;;;2016-03-30T15:07:05+0000;1459350425;2016-03-30 17:07:05;0;3;0;0;3;2;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

After many emails  phone calls FB posts where everyone is very apologetic as per their training at the end of every message they say  but there s nothing we can do  you should have read the small print. After a week or so of getting nowhere with Tesco i was referred to Clever boxes who were supposed to have had it collected today but as yet 3-15 pm no message from the courier who i was told would contact me at 10am. So  after staying up late last night transferring my files  packaging the laptop and staying in today the lady from Cleverboxes tells me  well they are probably busy and didn t guarantee picking it up today. THIS IS THE MOST APPALLING BUYING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD my views and inconvenience mean absolutely nothing to either Tesco or Cleverboxes  but i suppose i should have read the small print after all thats what it s therefore to enable companies to avoid any responsibility  again APPALLING.;;;;;2016-03-30T14:24:13+0000;1459347853;2016-03-30 16:24:13;0;3;1;0;4;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

Not sure if this has been discussed as I have not visited your page before  but want to let you know that I think the new  Farms  branding is a dreadful idea! As the farms obviously do not exist  it seems like a very feeble attempt to make us think we are buying better  farm  produce. On the contrary  for me it just insults my intelligence. I have no problem with the produce  just the new labelling. I know you have had problems over the last few years  but to me this looks like you have just created another! I m surprised it got past the discussion stages and would be interested in learning the thinking behind it.

The meat style burgers have no taste at all (do you employ tasters?)

I ordered a fridge freezer and a tumble dryer in the Tesco Extra store in pool over a week ago. They was both hotpoint. The girl there told me i would get an hour delivery slot ( I NEVER DID) also told me as my adress wouldnt show up to ring on the day of delivery and change the address as mine wouldnt show up( ALSO WASNT ALLOWED!!!!) So it was going to get delivered to my friends hour 10 minute walk away from my house waiting in ffof the timeslot that HOTPOINT had sent me for it not to turn up so i ring them and they tell me its 5 mintues away and a driver was going to ring me.. What a suprise NO PHONECALL!! so i rang them again to be told it was an hour away. Made a complaint and was told by hotpoint all tesco had to do was email them accross my correct adress so they could put it in manually!!!! Cancelled the order went to Tesco last night to get hardly any reaction to it and was told ut will be better if i waited until today to speak to a manager. Went there and after 20 minutes of waiting they finally found someone!!! JUST TO LET YOU KNOW TESCO THIS IS NOW 2 DAYS YOU HAVE RUINED AS I AM HAVING TO HUNT AROUND FOR A FRIDGE FREEZER! HAVING MY 4 YEAR PLD NEPHEW AND A 5 MONTH OLD BABY WITH NO FRIDGE!! IVE BEEN LUCKY TO GET ANY SORRY ALONG THE WAY IN THIS AND IVE HAD TO DO ALL THE CHASING! I KNOW IM JUST A NUMBER TO YOU BUT I WILL NEVER EVER SHOP IN YOUR SHOP AGAIN I THINK TESCO NEEDS TO SORT ITSELF OUT ABSOLOUTLY FURIOUS! DISGUSTING COMPANY!!!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠;;;;;2016-03-30T09:20:31+0000;1459329631;2016-03-30 11:20:31;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Firstly  not everyone likes to be physically touched by a total stranger  irrespective of the intent. Secondly  try looking up the concept of transmission -  you know  the idea of spreading infections through amongst other things skin contact!  My wife today witnessed a greeter at your walkden store touch the face of a child who quite obviously had a cold and then walk straight up to an old lady and do the same. Not saying get rid  just maybe teach them that not everyone likes it and it s maybe not the most hygienic of practices.;;;;;2016-03-29T23:09:52+0000;1459292992;2016-03-30 01:09:52;2;4;2;0;6;4;3;1;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Visited today for a small top up of groceries  when I got there were signs everywhere promoting their 25% off if you purchased 6 or more bottles of wine. It seemed churlish not to take advantage. However when I checked out and paid the receipt showed no discount. I found a Tesco supervisor to ask why no discount was given  she explained that it was only on selected items. I pointed out that this wasn t indicated on their large promotion signs and took her to one. She then pointed to a minute asterisk. I asked the relevance and she said that meant only selected items. I asked  how was is supposed to know that and she pointed to another very small notice that explained the offer. I left the store and won t be going back to Tescos ever again.

This is despite me receiving an email from them (I have a copy) in Nov 14 thanking me for sending it in & telling me I don t need to keep original - oh yes that is what they said! I am now without a Hudl whilst they deal with it with no timescale. As you sold the insurance & the Hudl to me some QUICK customer service your end would be great please. Thank you;;;;;2016-03-29T11:35:54+0000;1459251354;2016-03-29 13:35:54;2;14;2;0;16;14;2;12;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

No my chosen Bourbon is a Tesco own brand  so I would like to express my disappointment and my utter shock at when approximately two months ago my local Tesco Extra in Dudley had unfortunately ran out of Bourbons (they had the upmarket ones but as I said I don t like those).

I have returned most days over the past two months however when I make my way to the biscuit isle hoping and praying I will be able to purchase my desired Bourbons I am greeted by an horrific sight  right next to the custard creams (where said Bourbons usually live) there is simply an empty space  much like the empty space in my heart.   I realise to some it s just a Bourbon but to me it s my morning treat  the one thing I get to look forward to in the morning. it s been two months now and the withdrawal symptoms are bringing to show.

Bad advertising Tesco. Therefore she advised ordering online with next day delivery. i then did what she said and ordered online for next day delivery. I ordered Saturday afternoon  received my email with tracking number. With it being Easter i assumed id receive it in time for my holiday on Tuesday or early Wednesday but contacted Hermes this morning and asked if they knew if Tue OR wed and they said neither - Hermes do NOT do next day delivery - if this is the case WHY has Tesco charged me £5 extra delivery for next day delivery that service doesn t exist. I am now going away with NO bag  as no idea when it will arrive since its not what i paid for!! Really not happy about this!! Really disappointing way to start holiday with the let down on the item i need more than others!!;;;;;2016-03-28T08:36:58+0000;1459154218;2016-03-28 10:36:58;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I purchased my husband and myself a tichy chokablok billionaires dynamite egg for Easter  the promise of milk chocolate with honeycomb pieces  chocolate coasted shortcake biscuit and fudge chunks made my eyes light up and I knew me and my husband would be in for a treat on Easter Sunday this being our only egg.  Imagine our delight as we both opened the box and just sat staring at our egg in our hands  drooling over the chocolatey honeycomby fudgy shortcakey goodness before us.  Then we took our first bite and that s when it all went down hill.  Nowhere on the box does it state that the  milk chocolate  would be coffee flavoured  No where does it state that there should be a taste of coffee at all in our Easter egg.  Now my husband is not a coffee drinker  I drink it but I m not a coffee flavoured chocolate fan  My Easter has been ruined and I imagine my 4 nieces I brought the same egg for will not be overly impressed either.  This has spoilt what was shaping up to be a good day Tesco  I hope your happy!  Please in future could you state on your packaging of eggs if the chocolate is coffee flavoured so others do not have to go through the same heartbreak as we have  Yours sincerely  Lindsay shepherd Chocoholic;;;;;2016-03-27T18:52:55+0000;1459104775;2016-03-27 20:52:55;0;36;3;1;40;33;10;23;103;0;0;0;0;3;0;0;0

Absolutely no Dairy free Easter alternatives for my 2year old! So I also took a trip in store because iv always been able to get a good alternative for my son! Nope in store was just as horrendous! I was shown to two dairy free eggs! One was only 65g of white chocolate and cost a whopping £2.50! The other was dark chocolate and £3 but similar size! ( I could however pick up a Easter egg trail bundle inc 16 eggs and clues for £3! For a non dairy child!?!) Still no dairy free chocolate bar  buttons brownies or cakes in free from isle  normal sweet isle or seasonal! Your staff didn t know where else to look and couldn t explain why the sudden lack of Dairy free! There wasn t even spaces on shelves for these items!  Unfortunately dairy free isn t a lifestyle choice for many people  it s an Allergy! So when my sons friends have received brightly coloured  fun looking Easter eggs and chocolate gifts my son has had plain normal looking sweet bags! I m grateful that he s still at an age I can bypass the worst of the Easter hype!

But today I witness pure greed whilst at the Tesco s store located in Pitsea  Essex. Myself and my other half were looking at the reduced sections around the store and we had noticed that people had literally filled their trollies so high with reduced food items. So high that other customers thought that the trollies weren t being used by another customer. This customer had over 9 tubs of 1p grapes. Which fair enough if you like grapes go for it but what about everyone else?. I m sure many other customers would agree that you should only be allowed a certain amount of reduced items in your basket/trolley. What about people that struggle to provide for their families and rely on reduced food to get them by? Even if this customer struggled themselves it is still pure greed to have so many items from the reduced section without thinking of other people. And this didn t happen at just one point of my shop at Tesco s it also happened at the bakery reduced where a woman had filled her trolley full of bread and cakes that people then again thought that it was being used to put reduced items in. I think it will be a great idea to start putting a cap on the amount of reduced food you can have on your shopping trip. Less greed. More consideration.

Milk prices are at an all time low with many farmers going out of business each week.  Beef prices are falling through the floor.   Surely this means you  as a British Company  can buy at a lower price and support our farmers instead of importing cheap carcasses and labelling them as produced in England when in fact they have only been cut up in England?  Come on Tesco.  Support your customers - dont put them out of business;;;;;2016-03-26T20:39:32+0000;1459024772;2016-03-26 21:39:32;6;0;6;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;0

Left my wife s car with the Car Wash people lunch time today  walked across to Next then walked back to go in Tesco. As we walked past the car wash area on the pavement outside (& above) we were shocked to see one of the attendants rooting through a bag my wife had in the boot. (The car was backed in to the car wash bay so we had a very clear view from above). He had a good root around in this bag for at least 30 seconds while we were watching  found nothing valuable so carried on cleaning. (So shocked we didn t think quickly enough to video him). When confronted  none of them understood any English.... Managed to convince him (and his colleagues) that he was a thief and he eventually said sorry. I ve used this car wash before  when it first started they always logged each vehicle in on a tablet device and issued receipts but recently no logging-in or receipts have been happening so that makes you wonder how much of the takings are actually going in the till  and how many items have gone missing from people s cars. Have complained to Tesco but waiting to see how they progress the matter. No one has been in touch yet and this guy is probably still working on site. The Car Wash is operated by a franchise called  Waves  but their publicity leads you to believe it is operated by Tesco.;;;;;2016-03-26T18:45:35+0000;1459017935;2016-03-26 19:45:35;1;8;1;1;10;8;3;5;4;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Not to mention the game industry the UK produces millions of game birds and venison which is a healthy organic and cheap option of meat but not on your shelves    And not to mention the fruit and veg industries as well    What I would like to see happen which I m sure the majority of your customers would also like to see happen  is that Tesco makes a pledge to buy more of British produce  if it can be produced in the UK it should be sourced in the UK at a fair price for the producers creating a fair trade for UK farmers  if it can be UK sourced 80% of the product must come from UK farms  obviously there is stock that can not be UK sourced such as bananas and oranges  but there is plenty of products that could and should be. Support the UK farmers and the UK Will support you    Stand by your nation and set a precedent that all others can follow    So please listen to your customers and stand by the nation that has made you who you are  this would create more jobs in the UK and will benefit the UK and in turn will benefit you with customers becoming loyal to your stores and not moving to other alternatives;;;;;2016-03-26T18:30:21+0000;1459017021;2016-03-26 19:30:21;13;3;13;6;22;3;1;2;1;0;13;0;0;0;0;0;0

Are you planning to replace it with a different brand or just not sell an alternative to dairy ice cream?  This is the second time we ve been with no oatly chocolate milk. You still have oatly milks as well as many varieties of plant milk. Only sell chocolate milk in lunchbox carton size (3 pack). Please bring it back or stock more of it  or koko chocolate.   You seem to have stopped selling the lemon and lime provamel yogurts. Again you sell the plain one and coconut. The lemon and lime was amazing. As were the other flavoured yogurts.   And now to the major gripe which is cereals. It is a constant battle and the ever changing recipies are maddening. You have followed Kellogs and Sainsbury s by ruining nearly every one by thr addition of vitamin D. The raspberry malties were OK until recently then in came vit D. It s OK I ll just have plain malties  and within two weeks vitamin D has sneaked into those as well. Unlike Nestle s originals. Please get a vegan vitamin D or allow people to supplement themselves  it is maddening.

It may be and Ireland only phenomenon but just in case it is more wide spread I m posting here.  For the record I am a happy TESCO / TESCOMobile customer and just want to warn other of a scam that may cost them money.  It claims  TESCO  are considering opening a new center [sic] in Dublin and asks 4 inane questions. After getting 4 responses it asks the name of the UK supermarket with a green logo (ASDA). This takes you to a screen that asks for your mobile number and at the bottom  in tiny type face  it says  €7.50 per month draw entry fee  plus  €2.50 per text .  It is run by Mad Prizes* and on retracing my steps there are disclaimers all the way through saying the  survey  is not affiliated with the retailer or product manufacturer named. This leads me to believe there are other similar scams knocking around.  I have no idea how I got to this particular  scam-petition  site as I take the usual precautions browser-wise. It s been a while since I saw a new scam-petition.  The logos and colours are realistic enough to lull the unwary into a false sense of security.   And hey  let s be careful out there; do it them before they do it us.  (Hill Street Blues 198x)  PMMCG";;;;;2016-03-26T16:10:51+0000;1459008651;2016-03-26 17:10:51;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Whilst shopping we had a very near miss to what could of been a very serious incident for my son. One of your employees was pushing a large heavy cage quickly up the middle of the Isle.  I had stopped to look at products and as the cage passed us the door which wasn t locked swung round smashing in to our trolley centimetres from my son s head and face. If my son hadn t slightly changed his position in the trolley seconds before  this would have been a serious incident.  Both of us were quite shaken and received a  sorry about that  from your employee which to be honest didn t sound very sorry .. i also reported it to the customer service where I received a half hearted sorry and was told the cage doors are supposed to be locked while moving. My complaint/issue was NOT recorded either which shows that Tesco doesn t really care about what happens to its customers whilst in Tesco premises. I would hate to think of the outcome if my son had been seriously hurt! a half hearted sorry is not good enough in either situation.

I ordered some items through Tesco direct for our new house and specifically booked for them to come last Saturday as we work Monday to Friday. The items were due to be delivered by yodel. We were home all day and at around 4.45pm we looked at the yodel tracker and it stated that they tried to deliver and left a card. We were in the flat and no one rang us or buzzed on the apartment intercom and certainly no calling card was left. I then rang your team to complain and was advised that they would book a redelivery for us after 5pm on Tuesday although this could not be guaranteed as yodel don t work like that apparently. My partner then took Tuesday off work to make sure we could get this delivery. The same thing then happened. The tracker said they had tried to deliver and left a calling card. Needless to say we had no phone call  no one rang the buzzer and no calling card was left. My partner had wasted his day off.   I rang your call centre again to try and cancel the order and the lady I spoke to said why don t we just try one more time. So she rescheduled for today Saturday the 26th of March. We have been home all morning and the exact same thing has now happened. There is no possible way yodel have been here as we have been home each time. If there was such an issue with the address they should have called us on the contact number provided. I m so disappointed and have now cancelled the order. I genuinely don t think I ll be shopping with Tesco direct ever again and will just purchase my items elsewhere.;;;;;2016-03-26T12:16:08+0000;1458994568;2016-03-26 13:16:08;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I went in with my daughters last Saturday at the time advertised for the Easter egg hunt. My daughters were very disappointed to be told we had the wrong day and it was today at 11. I promised to take them back  which I did today. When we got there we were told by shop floor staff that they knew nothing about this and nothing was happening today. Again very disappointed daughters. We then went to check with the customer service desk and spoke to Josh. He contacted another lady (didn t get her name but she was dressed as an egg!).  She then asked us to wait 5 minutes and sent Josh to hide some eggs for my girls! They literally went out of their way to do this for us. We are so grateful and now have some happy girls. Thank you so much.;;;;;2016-03-26T12:08:42+0000;1458994122;2016-03-26 13:08:42;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Yesterday  after a quick after school shop with two demons in tow  I realised I couldn t find my car keys. Asked at customer services and security  went back to the till  thinking I had perhaps dropped them when I took my purse out my pocket  no luck. Started to retrace our steps  still no sign. Asked a member of staff in one of the aisles if any keys had been handed to him. At this point the store manager started to help us look  along with other staff. The manager escorted us round the store retracing our steps and helped me look through our shopping etc. in search of the missing key. He came out in the rain to look around my car and had staff look through baskets and shelves trying to locate them. He had a member of staff take my kids to the cafe and gave them drawing books to keep them entertained. He waited with me while I called round to check my insurance and get in contact with my family. We live quite far out in the countryside  and the nearest bus stop is the next village along from our little hamlet. As we couldn t find the key I decided to get a taxi home to find the spare. Instead  the absolute star who was looking after my kids (and who s insurance covered it!) offered to take me and my children home  and another member of staff lent us a child seat for my 3 year old. I had to leave the car over night as my Dad had been working away  and I couldn t find the spare till this morning. I can t believe how helpful all the staff were and how they went out of there way to assist me and my children. Absolutely fantastic! Really made a stressful situation so much easier than it could have been.   I went back to thank the manager today  and have promised to give them feedback on your website  but wanted to share it publicly as well. All fabulous people!!!;;;;;2016-03-25T22:21:41+0000;1458944501;2016-03-25 23:21:41;203;20;216;15;251;19;12;7;24;0;196;13;0;0;0;0;0

He kept saying sorry and people in the queue were getting impatient which upset him all the more. The checkout girl returned with his milk  plonked it in his basket. He was very confused so I helped him with his money and helped him get himself together and he left. I was disgusted. This young persons only concern was for her tea break.

Now when i go online to buy i don t expect to have to read all the small print on a retailers site for fear of being mislead  key facts should be prominently and clearly displayed (on the Tesco website there was a small Cleverboxes logo) i expected better from Tesco. I asked Tesco if they recieved any profit from my sale although i can t get a straight answer on that but they said  Tesco allow partner companies to sell on our website as a way of showcasing smaller companies products  now i don t for one minute believe that Tesco are allowing rival companies to steal their customers off their website out of the goodness of their hearts with no profit going to Tesco. I bought off the Tesco website  they had my money and i believe profited from that sale  that makes them responsible. maybe the CEO could make this point clear about profits.

I ordered 10 bottles of wine yesterday taking advantage of the 25% off 6 or more bottles which was clearly promoted on their website for the wine I ordered. The order was delivered today and guess what  the discount was not applied. I spent 20 mins getting through to customer support only to be told that the promotion had been removed from that particular wine so I was billed the full amount. Customer services  response was that Tesco can remove a promotion at any time and would not honour the price advertised as the delivery was made today. In my limited experience  if a product is promoted and listed as having a discount applicable  then the retailer should honour that; it appears that Tesco has no honour. So my warning  if this post is not removed by Tesco  is to proceed cautiously as you may be charged more than you anticipated!! So Beware!";;;;;2016-03-24T21:26:26+0000;1458854786;2016-03-24 22:26:26;0;8;0;0;8;7;2;5;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

This is a very dubious if not devious practice as these key facts should be made much clearer not hidden in the reams of small print. Tesco apart from returning emails and phone calls will have nothing to do with the problem saying it is not their responsibility  in my world whoever takes your money sold it to you. I contacted Cleverboxes who told me to contact Hewlett Packard  i did not see why it was now MY problem to do all the work to get it repaired so i declined  they have now got back to me saying they will send it for repair but can t give me any idea how long i will be without it  6 weeks 6 months they don t know  if that is the case i have asked for a replacement but they seem reluctant to do this. So  beware of buying from Tesco  partners  as when things go wrong they won t want to know  i did ask if they got a share of the profits from their  partner  sales but can t get anyone at Tesco to answer that question  i would be amazed if they allow people to sell from their website out of the goodness of their hearts.. s.harvey;;;;;2016-03-24T16:42:20+0000;1458837740;2016-03-24 17:42:20;0;4;1;0;5;4;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

The staff in your South Wigston store are a lot friendlier and chattier than they used to be which is really nice.  I went in with my mum yesterday who is usually an Asda shopper and she commented on how much friendlier Tesco is than Asda.  2. The new restaurant is excellent.  The food is really good - so far I ve had sausage and mash and a cheeseburger (not on the same visit) and both were really well cooked and tasty with generous portions.  Being one of the few places without a Costa Coffee (except for a machine in a nearby petrol station) it s really nice to be able to go into Tesco and get a decent cup of coffee.;;;;;2016-03-24T08:24:51+0000;1458807891;2016-03-24 09:24:51;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

On monday evening i visited your elmers end branch to pick up a few bits before returning home  after around five mins of being in your store two of your colleagues decided it would be a nice idea to go from standing in the middle of an isle having pointless conversation to openly making remarks and gasps about they way i was dressed (if your wondering i am a goth) before i had even walked away from them. I was literally staring at them while they fell silent and then went onto gasp and gossip on the shop floor about what i looked like. I genuinely thought i was going crazy and decided to catch up with my friend and tell her what had just happened and she thought at first that i was over reacting  so a few minutes later we walked past again and she witnessed them do the same if not more offensive remarks and gasps. I was so shocked that this event even transpired ii could barely continue shopping i felt like crying it was absolutely awful. I worked as a member of staff for Tesco for two years myself and know for a fact that this sort of behavior is no tolerated. I chose to take my complaint to a manager who assured me he was sorry and that he would issue an apology from the staff and reprimand their behavior. I left him with an email to contact me and let me know what has happened and have heard nothing back. Only a week ago i was busy reading an article about how staff members had publicly shamed and basically humiliated a girl who used to self harm by refusing service and blaming it on an invisible policy  The worst part is i am not the only person this is happening too i know many people who are left so ashamed they cannot even try to take it further. Why do you feel that it is acceptable behavior for your staff to behave in a manner like this? Two months ago i was being treated for severe clinical depression and had the timing been any different i have no idea what could have happened. I have already been put into a position where we are now having to disscuss my return to medication due to this incident and i cannot even get an apology issued. It s appalling and disgusting to say the least and i will never be placing a foot through the doors of one of your stores again.;;;;;2016-03-24T00:11:30+0000;1458778290;2016-03-24 01:11:30;0;7;0;0;7;7;3;4;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

There is something about my local Tesco srtore that I absolutely love. Its the fact that often when I visit there I see and hear this incredibly talented busker called Josh. He really is so so good - and he s so friendly and polite. I have heard to day that you are banning him from playing. God knows why you don t want him there as I swear he brings people to the store. However what you have said is that he may stop people making donations to local charities. We all know this is nonsense don t we  so can we start behaving like adults maybe? You give Joshua his pitch back or we ll make bloody sure that while people carry on supporting local charities  they stop shopping with you. How does that sound?  Joshua Sole has been busking in and around the Telford area since January 2013. During his time busking he spent many hours playing music in Madeley  where he spent his childhood growing up around the markets with his dad Steve  who is a market trader of 25 years.  Joshua has become a part of the Madeley community and many people  old and young  look forward to hearing Josh and chatting to him  as he is a true local  with roots in the area and many fantastic friends who support his music. Tesco on a few occasions have asked Josh to move along and he has stood his ground and refused  now this week on the 17/3/2016 Joshua was busking in Madeley  when he was approached by a security guard and a Fresh Food Manager and asked to move on. They said Tesco donate to charity and Josh s busking may deter people from donating  so Josh offered that he donates 10% of his busking earning to their instore charities. They declined. He then stated after this weekend  he will be out of the area for some time and asked for this weekend  that the management allow him to busk Friday afternoon 17/3 and Sunday daytime 21/3 for a period not exceeding two hours on each day. They declined.  Since Tesco arrived in Madeley many small local business  have ceased trading and the local market has shrunk to an unrecognisable size due to fierce competition and Tesco s purchasing Madeley. Please sign this petition to show Tesco that we support our local busker s and we wont see massive corporations like Tesco punch down to the small guys  and that we the undersigned support our small local business . Lets try and help Josh get his pitch back for when he is next in Madeley  and also allow other buskers to our small  welcoming and friendly Parish.;;;;;2016-03-23T16:23:37+0000;1458750217;2016-03-23 17:23:37;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I know exactly what is needed and plan my shop in advance. But.....yesterday I was thrown off balance  as I neared the end of my mammoth shop  strolling (with a purpose) down the aisle with cling film  bin bags etc  I arrive at the sandwich bags. Now  as I have to provide lunches for 6 children and a husband  I have found the Tesco Value sandwich bags are a perfect size and have the added bonus of somewhere to write their names. I m looking  top shelf to bottom  nope can t see them anywhere. But I check again just to make sure. I even asked a member of staff  to be told the devastating news that they have been discontinued 😱.   I just wanted to let you lovely people at Tesco know that this has meant my children  and husband  now have to make do with foil covered sandwiches as I am unsure of the quality of your other sandwich bags.   Yours sincerely   A stressed mother and wife;;;;;2016-03-23T08:33:44+0000;1458722024;2016-03-23 09:33:44;4;18;4;2;24;16;14;2;13;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

As I need to travel 20 miles to buy daura for my husband. Can you please explain to me why you have done this???

Also  there is so little Free From products aimed at young children. You re maybe missing a gap in the market. I know it s only packaging  but I know children would not like to feel they re different. And it must be a pain for parents of children with intolerances to have to check the labels of everyday foods to see if their children can eat something similar to their friends without paying the inflated  free from  prices.   However  well done on the new Free From Caterpillar cake  I m looking forward to buying it for my son s birthday party who has a gluten intolerant guest.;;;;;2016-03-22T21:10:25+0000;1458681025;2016-03-22 22:10:25;1;1;3;0;4;1;1;0;0;0;1;2;0;0;0;0;0

We drove nearly 20 miles to collect our shopping which we ordered through click and collect. Only to be greeted at the loading bay with a sign  saying  go to customer services in Store   We was then informed by Lisa at customer services that there had been a power cut today and our shopping was not picked  your Head Office was told by the Store to contact all customers for this afternoon / evening collections and inform them that our orders would not be ready today.  Did my husband  or myself get this call from your Customer Services at Head Office?  No we did not  but we did get an email giving us £10 off our next online shop and thanking us for notifying Tesco of a complaint. we did not complain to Tesco as we had nothing to complain about and it wasn t until we got to your Exeter store that we realised what the online voucher was for. The email also said it values its customer feed back. Well here is feed back........ Sort your head office customer services out it sucks.!!!!!!  The Staff at your Exeter store was excellent Lisa on the desk and your Dot.com manager was very appologetic. They did everything they could to help us get a few essentials as we couldnt do a full shop as we had our dogs in the car to get us through the next 24hrs. Maybe you should transfer them to head office  and run customer services as clearly they have the customers intentions at heart. When we rang Tesco.Com from the customer services desk to rearrange to have our groceries repicked for the next day to collect we was told that nothing could be done for the next 2 days. After speaking to a customer services advisor on the phone we did get  told we would receive £20 to cover our fuel as a good will gesture. If we get this voucher I will hold my breath.  Thanks for a completely wasted trip  and we still have empty cupboards. Hope you value this feedback.;;;;;2016-03-22T21:03:46+0000;1458680626;2016-03-22 22:03:46;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Sometimes I like a wrap  sometimes I like a pasta salad and sometimes I like a sandwich.  I m a strong believer in the sandwich. It s a solid lunch and there s a type for everyone. BLT  Egg and Cress  all day breakfast  I love them all.  However  I believe you are missing a key gap in the market. No UK supermarket currently stocks a ready made Marmite sandwich.  I m a keen lover of marmite. I lick the stuff out the jar. All I want in life is the ability to walk into a Tesco store and purchase the perfect sandwich filled with my favourite yeast extract.  I m a simple man. I m happy with plain marmite. Feel free to be creative though. Maybe cheese and marmite? Cheese  ham and marmite? I won t bore you with a list of suggestions as I m sure you have a fully capable research and development team.  So come on Tesco  give me the good stuff in a sandwich! Recognise this truly great product and reward marmite fans everywhere!  Yours  Ross Bibby  P.S. Don t fob me off with Vegemite. That stuff is disgusting and yes  I will be able to taste the difference.;;;;;2016-03-22T20:44:32+0000;1458679472;2016-03-22 21:44:32;25;7;29;0;36;7;6;1;0;0;25;0;0;4;0;0;0

Instead we have been given just garlic dough balls for 42 calories more and 2.8g of protein less per 3 dough ball serving (trust me  this counts when you are post-op gastric bypass and live on 800-1000 calories a day whilst getting 60-80g of protein in too). You have also added thickeners (which  although the new recipe doesn t contain milk  wheat or egg  many people are sensitive to xanthan gum and guar gum) and doubled the amount of sugar! I can t quite believe that last bit  considering that so many people are now cutting it from their diets - or at least reducing their daily intake considerably - due to the health risks associated with consuming large amounts of it. I can appreciate that you wanted to offer something to those who can t tolerate milk but why take away the old version to replace it with this? Could you not stock both?  Here is a comparison:  1 cheesy garlic dough ball: 36 calories  1.1g protein  Ingredients: Tapioca Starch (Sulphites)  Semi Skimmed Milk  Pasteurised Egg  Emmental Medium Fat Hard Cheese (Milk) (9%)  Mozzarella Cheese (Milk) (9%)  Medium Fat Hard Cheese (Milk) (9%)  Extra Virgin Olive Oil  Garlic Powder (Sulphites)  Salt  White Pepper  1 of the new garlic dough balls: 50 calories  0.1g protein  Ingredients: Potato Starch  Garlic Spread (30%)  Rice Starch  Water  Thickeners (Hydroxypropyl Methyl Cellulose  Xanthan Gum  Guar Gum)  Sugar  Yeast  Salt  Psyllium Husk Powder  Rapeseed Oil  Yeast Extract  Lentils  Acidity Regulator (Sodium Acetate)  Enzymes  Garlic Spread contains: Margarine  Garlic Purée  Water  Garlic Powder  Parsley  Rapeseed Oil  Salt  Onion Powder  Margarine contains: Palm Oil  Water  Rapeseed Oil  Coconut Oil  Emulsifier (Mono- and Di-Glycerides of Fatty Acids)  Flavouring  Vitamin A  Vitamin D  Colour (Beta-Carotene)  I am so disappointed. I m afraid I won t be buying the new ones. The ingredients list for the Cheesy Garlic Dough Balls looks like something I could whip up in my own kitchen... the new recipe doesn t appeal to me at all because of the added ingredients.;;;;;2016-03-22T16:56:26+0000;1458665786;2016-03-22 17:56:26;0;4;0;0;4;4;3;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have found the level of customer care sadly lacking. I must say that I have not been to the store for some time following witnessing a supervisor barrating a young lad in front of his colleagues and customers. She was absolutely vile to him and made him cry. Good stuff eh? I challenged the supervisor but I felt it fell on deaf ears. So after a period of absence I returned to the store today and spent over £50 (more fool me!). Whilst in the store I saw on the “reduced” shelves a number of items many of which did not have the yellow reduced label. However  that didn’t matter as of course everything on the sheves would be reduced and this is clearly stated on the sign above. I picked up some chocolate choux buns which I though my children would like but no label. I spoke to a member of staff who stood by me and asked if she could mark them down. They did by the way have a best before date of today 22/03. She told me that it had nothing to do with her and that I should go to the bakery section who would mark it down. So after thanking her I went off to the bakery section and expalained what had occurred and asked if the lady there could mark down the pastries so I could go to the checkout. This was around 9.30 am. I was met with - “ I cant do that. Can’t mark anything down until 10 am”. Pressing her on the basis that it was 9.30 I was met with a firm “no”. I then asked why  if they had not been reduced  were they on the reduced shelf under the sign that  said everything on the shelf was reduced. She replied that it was nothing to do with her then turned to her colleagues to ask if they knew to which all responded  “no  don’t know anything about it”. I was then directed to go to a checkout and could have it reduced there. On arrival at the checkout I explained once again the debacle and asked if she could reduce the item as suggested by the bakery staff. “I cant do that” was the response and suggested the bakery staff would have to do it!! I then pointed out again it was they who sent me to the checkout. A supervisor was called to the checkpout and I had to exp[lain the whole thing again. I was by this time getting very frustrated having been pushed from pillar to post by staff who quite frankly didn’t want to take responsibility. So what could the supervisor do? Obviously she had been trained to the highest standard in customer relations and seeing how I had been treated  would resolve the problem by marking down the item and offering an apology. Well that’s how the story should have gone but this is Tesco so no such luck. I was told nothing could be done as it wasn’t the magic time of 10 am. I repeated that I had been directed around the store and each person I spoke to passed the buck. I queried again the point of placing things on reduced shelves when they were not reduced. Customers could and no doubt do  unwittingly pay full price for things they believe to be reduced.  The supervisor suggested the items must have been placed there by a customer. I expressed the view that this could not be the case unless that customer had deposited several other items which did not have a yellow label. The item’s best before date was today and as it was clear to be marked down at 10 am  it is more likely to have been put there by the bakery staff.  So what would I say my experience was like? Alsolutely dreadful - no customer care (more like don’t care). Every little helps?? I don’t think so!!! When will you learn  Teco  that it is the customers who keeps your shops open??;;;;;2016-03-22T15:23:40+0000;1458660220;2016-03-22 16:23:40;2;13;2;0;15;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Just had my online shop delivered  ordered 3 x 90g packs of mini eggs in bags and you have substituted 2 x 103g tubes.  You don t know if I wanted 3 lots of mini eggs or 270g of mini eggs.  Either way you have failed because I only have 2 lots and 206g.  It really is common sense and frustrates me that your pickers haven t got this skill (or should I say common sense).  You usually do it with a joint of meat on a Sunday meaning I have to go to the store to resolve  this is to do with Easter Cakes I am meant to be cooking this evening.

He struggles with strong flavours (even if that flavour seems mild to us). Tesco was the only place that made strawberry toothpaste. It made teeth brushing time easy. But to my dismay you stopped making it a year ago! I managed to find one store that sold it at the time and bought a few tubes but this stash has run out! I ve tried all sorts of flavours with him since and all make him heave and refuse to brush. Bringing the strawberry toothpaste back would save so many unnecessary meltdowns. Is this something you would be able to consider? After speaking to other mums in the same situation  I know that there would be a lot less battles up and down the country come tooth brush time if this was a possibility!!;;;;;2016-03-22T09:53:19+0000;1458640399;2016-03-22 10:53:19;0;10;0;0;10;7;2;5;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Recieved a phone call 20 minutes before my delivery was due saying my card wasn t accepted and I needed to give my details again over the phone or you wouldn t be able to deliver. Same card I have always used for my shop for many years and which I have used several times since Without problem. Needless to say I didnt give my details over the phone because it could have been anyone calling. In these days of fraud awareness surely this shouldn t happen?! I asked if an email had been sent to confirm what had happened and that I would be receiving a call to request the card details again - no  and no further communication since. Consequence: I have no shopping and a little less faith in Tesco;;;;;2016-03-21T14:18:15+0000;1458569895;2016-03-21 15:18:15;1;4;1;0;5;4;2;2;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

My daughter fell out of the baby seat on a trolley which admittedly was entirely my fault  I thought she was strapped in but she wasn t. She landed on her head and as you can imagine she screamed the place down. Not a single person offered me any help with her whatsoever including the person on the checkout I was standing at whilst trying to comfort her. I then packed my shopping whilst trying to hold her and left the shop. I had to take her to a&e within half an hour of leaving the store as she was drowsy and vomiting. As a mother and customer I am appalled actually that nobody offered me any help with packing up my shopping or that it wouldn t be required for a first aider to see her.;;;;;2016-03-21T10:35:01+0000;1458556501;2016-03-21 11:35:01;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Scheduled an order to be delivered between 8-9pm. No call from the driver. Called Tesco at 9:15 pm to chase up. The advisor Cathy could get no response from the driver and would call us back within 10 minutes regardless of what news she could update us with. We had to ring in at 9:55 pm to check what was going on. Note on file apparently said she called us back but no response  the phone was right beside us and no missed calls. The second advisor said our delivery had been cancelled due to driver sickness (so presumably we could have been informed in advance and made other plans). The advisor has rescheduled the shop to tomorrow and despite this poor customer service has only offered a paltry £10 off and felt like this issue was simply swept under the rug and of very little  importance. In doing so they have removed a £5 saving  so essentially this is £5.   We will be calling in the morning to cancel the order as the contact centre is closed and as we currently have an inclusive delivery package we will be cancelling this also and doing future shops with a competitor.

What kind of shopping delivery service is that.  When I asked when they knew this was a problem I was told 5 pm why has it take over 4 hours for someone to call me and inform me of this. Apparently I was right at the bottom of the list - seriously! nice to know where I stand There wasn t even an offer to deliver a day later.  I have no bread or ham for my sons sandwiches for school tomorrow and now my husband has had to go out and try and find somewhere thats open to get some.  All i can say is that this is a disgrace. Its one thing having an issue  another  not informing your customers quickly or thinking about how they are communicated to   it shows a complete lack of customer service and to add insult to injury Im  told  oh we will give you £10 off your next shop.  The last time Tesco let me down this badly was christmas eve a couple of years ago when your delivery van showed up and told me they didn t have my christmas turkey at 11 pm  despite me putting the order in  a month previously.  You may be a big company but you don t know anything about customer service and if I acted in this way my company would soon be out of business. This is an absolute joke.  After the turkey debacle it took me a long time to trust tesco again and now I will be taking my business elsewhere yet again and for good.

Yesterday I received my car insurance renewal which was over £100 more than last year. this is odd as I haven t moved  changed my job  my car or had an accident. Like most people then looked at a comparison site only to find that Tesco were quoting a price that was £134 cheaper than my renewal for exactly the car & cover. I rang Tesco to give them he opportunity to  rethink  the quote & was told that they couldn t  renew  my insurance for any less. However they could give me a new policy instead. I now have a new policy with with Tesco for £130 less than they quoted to renew & because I went through the comparison site (& not the guy on the phone)  I also have a cuddly toy on the way. I guess that Tesco will also have to pay the comparison site some commission too.;;;;;2016-03-20T19:58:22+0000;1458503902;2016-03-20 20:58:22;2;0;2;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

The first time when initially contacting Tesco I was told that as the vouchers had been spent I must have redeemed them myself. After a long call to Tesco I eventually convinced the representative that it hadn t been myself that had used the vouchers. On further investigation it was established that my account had been hacked and the vouchers had been sent to an email account that wasn t mine.Unfortunately I had to wait until my next statement for my points to be credited to my account. This was very disappointing as I had intended to use the vouchers for something specific in the lead up to Christmas.  Today I logged into my account to find that £73:00 worth of vouchers had been used on 19.03.16. I was astonished to see that my account had  been hacked again. I called the Clubcard helpline and spoke to Ewan who was very helpful and quickly established that the transaction in my account was already being dealt with by the fraud team . He was able to confirm that the vouchers had been redeemed for Pizza Express and sent to an email address that didn t match mine.  This has left me concerned regarding  the security and again very disappointed as I am unable to book the hotel that I intended to book using my vouchers for a special celebration. I have been informed that I will have the points returned to my account in the next few days . I hope this is the case and that I don t have to wait for my next statement as I did last time.  I urge anyone with an account to check it as there is clearly a problem. I know that £73:00 isn t a massive amount but that isn t the point. As a customer who spends £1000 s a year with Tesco I would like to think that my loyalty rewards are safe.;;;;;2016-03-20T15:05:51+0000;1458486351;2016-03-20 16:05:51;0;5;0;1;6;5;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I think its a very poor show for sure a large Extra store.;;;;;2016-03-20T13:10:57+0000;1458479457;2016-03-20 14:10:57;1;3;1;0;4;3;2;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Who came to delivery my delivery as usual 11am  He came to the door with my shopping in crates as usual with my empty crates at the front.  The first words before anything else was are those crates covered in cat urine ?! I always wash my crates off with soapy suds before being collected as they ve been outside waiting for delivery to arrive which is what I said.   I just always wash them    He said I can t take them they re covered in urine.  He wouldn t lift my crates into the house and I had to struggle to do as my home help doesn t arrive until 12 and I m not suppose to lift after my cancer operation   I am disabled but my disability is not apparent by looking. The delivery man insisted I unload my groceries but i Said I couldn t   He then stormed off and said im talking to my manager  where he told his manager (I Presume ) that my trays where covered in urine and that I wouldn t unload my groceries as  she said she s disabled   I m sure the driver will deny the raised tone of disbelief  in his voice. Unfortunately I can t prove that  He came back from his van and said I m not taking them they re covered in cat urine.  I said that s your interpretation  not mine  he said well you told me last time they have. I said last time when. He said last time I did  your deliver. (I don t have memory of this due to my disability but i always wash the trays in Case a cat has been around and if that s true then he took them away anyway)  I said but I ve told you those ones are clean. He said I can t take your word for that. Which I then pointedly asked does that mean you do no believe what I am saying so technically Calling me a liar ? He said I don t believe what your saying but I m not calling you a liar. Asked me to sign for the shopping and told me his manager will ring me !  How can I ever use Tesco again. I would like my  delivery pass few reimbursing please. I can t explain the level of anxiety this has given me.  That was a very rude man who had obviously preconceived ideas.  my crates go back cleaner then they come. ! Trying to make a difference not using bags and have done for a long time way before the bag charge. Never had a problem before;;;;;2016-03-20T12:22:03+0000;1458476523;2016-03-20 13:22:03;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have been a delivery saver member for two years and never had a problem with the service. However the last two deliveries  the use by dates on the items I have ordered have been bad. I try to check everything when the driver is still with me which is hard when they are rushing and park their vans in the middle of the road instead of using a parking space to then have cars waiting for them to move.

I have just watched a video on the effects the objectification of women has on society as a whole. My son  who is just 10  didn t quite understand how the media plays a role in this. I grabbed the first magazine I could find to demonstrate  and this happened to be your February 2016 edition of Food Family Living. I am horrified at just how bad it actually is.  Your magazine shows countless images of women and children baking in the kitchen or shopping for food. It also shows one image of a woman in a bath (you only see her face). All these women and children are in full makeup  with not a hair out of place. There was also a drawing of a woman waving her husband goodbye as he drives away from the home.  The magazine also contained two pictures of men. One is an advertisement  in which the man wears a matador costume. While this is undoubtedly supposed to be funny  it does once again portray the man as a strong protector. The ONLY OTHER picture of a man in your entire magazine is one of a dad out on a bike ride with his sons  placed next to an image of a woman baking with her daughter.  I wonder if you realise that you are upholding serious gender stereotypes  and that these types of attitudes are what allow sexism to continue to exist. I would welcome a magazine in which these gender stereotypes are not present. In which you show people as they really are.  #IStandUp #WomenNotObjects #FeminismMatters;;;;;2016-03-20T09:58:44+0000;1458467924;2016-03-20 10:58:44;8;56;8;0;64;32;7;25;70;0;8;0;0;0;0;0;0

I had shopping delivery due today. It turns up minus my fridge items due to some kind of contamination. The driver didn t seem to have a clue what happened next. I called the helpline and it was confirmed what the driver said. The lady then contacted the store and told me the manager would call me back to let me know what was happening. That was around 10.30am. By 4 I d still not received said phonecall so I called up again  and once again they contacted the store and I was told the manager was getting all the fridge orders on a van (wasn t just my order affected) and that it would be out tonight and also that the manager would be contacting the customers affected which I was told should be around 6/7pm. 11.15pm  Still no call  still missing half my shopping  still no idea what the hell is going on with my order  you still have my money so I m unable to replace it elsewhere as I was told if I opted for a refund it would take 3-5 days. This isn t acceptable. I spend a lot of money on groceries each week not to mention the amount I spend on clothes  footwear and school uniform so the very LEAST I would of expected would being kept up to date with what s  going on not complete silence from tescos end.

Grapes went flying all over the floor and there was no manners or organisation from anyone. I found this to be DISGRACEFUL this situation (which i assume is a weekly occurrence based on the number of people loitering around) could easily result in someone getting injured. People were pushed and shoved and barged past  trollies were blocking the isle preventing me from doing my own shopping! Grapes flying everywhere is clearly a health and safety issue  and whichever memeber of staff is tasked with the mark downs must genuinly fear for there safety when they wheel that trolly out. This is not acceptable as it is your duty as a company to prevent stampedes in the middle of your stores! Clearly these items are frequently marked down at the same time each day.... i feel that this is dangerous based of the behviour i have seen tonight and it is only a matter of time before someone is injuried! It also prevents  anyone elsing getting a look in at the reductions  times are hard for alot of people and it should not be just those who act like animals who get to benefit from the reductions. Staggering the time at which reductions are made into no predictable pattern would surely reduce this animalistic behaviour and ensure the saftey of both your customers and your staff!  I will look forward to hearing off you in regards to this issue.  Many Thanks Amy;;;;;2016-03-19T20:16:59+0000;1458418619;2016-03-19 21:16:59;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The shopping app is awesome.  Several things planned for Saturday so I ordered an early collection slot.  Saturday morning came and I drove down to collect my shopping on route to doing several other things.  When trying to collect my shopping I was told that there was no paperwork for it as their printers were not working or something. At this point my stress levels rose thinking how I could fit the extra work of checking bags into my busy plans or going out to get missing items!!  I would have to check it all at home and ring the help line if there were items missing or substitutes I didn t wish. I could get a refund...not helpful if I needed something for dinner tonight!!  I refused to sign for it not knowing what I had paid for. I was very annoyed at the lack of basic organisation. It took me half an hour to finish checking and unpacking at home  not to mention sorting out the excessive bag usage.  Fortunately it was all there and I didn t have to go out to buy items which I might have needed. However this made me late in doing the other things I had planned. I had to ring around and alter plans. Something which is designed to be quick and easy to take away the stress of shopping  which I hate anyway  was highly stressful!!!

I had a very upset little girl covered in sick and hand full of sick that I had managed to catch. A vey kind customer assisted me and sought help from Adam the Bakery manager. He could not have been more helpful if he tried. He helped me clean my daughter up and even took a pair of pyjamas of the shop floor and gave these to me for free. He then went even further and help me to dress my daughter. He offered to keep my shopping to one side if I wanted to come back later and then bagged up all of my daughters clothes that were covered.  I really wanted to show my appreciation in some way so felt this message may get back to him. I did speak to the store manager but he didn t seem that bothered or interested in what I had to say.

It seemed a bit unusual as previously  if the driver was ever going to be late  they ve always called to let me know.I give Tesco a quick call to see what s occurring. After explaining situation to chap on the phone  he gets hold of driver and is told that driver had delivered it at 7.20pm. REALLY????? Errr......no  he did not!!!! Am I the only occupant? No! Could another member of the household have taken it in  signed for it and forgotten to mention it? Err yeah  that ll be it! I live in  a 3 bed semi  not Downton Abbey! I think I d notice if the shopping arrived  that I was waiting to cook for dinner! Several call backs later and it turns out that driver was quite adamant that he had delivered it to the correct house. Well  said driver is clearly MENTAL  or was lying to cover the fact that he d cocked up and delivered the shopping to the wrong house! Inhabitants of wrong house  were at this point  probably feasting on crisps  yogurt and dog food!!! I wouldn t mind so much but the chap on the phone was definitely not convinced  that I was not lying! Why I would want to lie and receive two identical deliveries  an hour apart  I don t quite understand. I m not sure when the old saying about the customer always being right  went out of the window but clearly it no longer applies.  The moral of the story? If someone arrives on your doorstep bearing bags of shopping that you didn t order  don t bloody sign for it you thieving ignoid!!!;;;;;2016-03-18T20:06:53+0000;1458331613;2016-03-18 21:06:53;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Usually my support worker has to go back and forth to get the security guard to come and drive it in and out of the car park as she doesn t feel comfortable driving it. Today I was transferring into her car whilst she went to fetch the guard when all of a sudden a young lad (he can t have been older than 13) rode over on his bike and tapped my window. He asked if I was ok because he saw my support worker leaving me. I explained where she had gone and he said  would you like me to help and drive it back in  I ll meet your friend and save her walking all the way in?  I was so taken aback by this helpful and thoughtful young mans offer and I said that would be very kind  he asked me to watch his bike and he drove the scooter back inside! Me and my support worker were both so shocked and touched by his caring and understanding nature that we didn t think to get his name. However we did chat with him and he is doing work experience on the canal by the post office depo and near tescos in Guildford and he is driving the boats. We couldn t thank him enough for being so considerate  if anyone knows who this young man is can you please get in touch with me? I would like to thank him personally and explain to him how much it meant to me to have someone helping me not laughing and staring. In the words of my support worker  you see? Not all people are bad! ;;;;;2016-03-18T19:56:21+0000;1458330981;2016-03-18 20:56:21;8;5;8;0;13;5;2;3;1;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;0

My shopping should have been delivered this evening but it s been returned to the store because the delivery driver could not find my address. Ok so that happens occasionally. But the flat numbers are on the front of the building and they didn t think to call me for direction??   So I ve been left with a situation where I have a family to feed - they are hungry. There is a chicken cooked but nothing to go with it. And I ve had to order more food because my delivery is not ariving til much later this evening.   I was offered a £5 e-voucher as compensation but I dont really think that is good enough. Our takeaway delivery dinner will cost £20. If there had been a major problem I could understand. But it doesn t seem to me that the driver made much effort to deliver my shopping...... I have a tired 3 year old to feed who will probably be asleep by the time we are able to have dinner. That is the most annoying thing of all.;;;;;2016-03-18T18:40:25+0000;1458326425;2016-03-18 19:40:25;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

There are clear signs stating that the spaces are for people to park in who have children under the age of five with them. Every time I go to Tesco I see ignorant people who do not have young children with them parking in these spaces and they continue to do so because they do not care and they know that they can. Your signs say that you have marshals patrolling the area  yet in all the years I have been shopping at Tesco  I have never seen anyone in forcing it. Parents and carers with small children really do need these spaces so that we can open our car doors wide enough to get our children out of their car seats. It s not fair that people take advantage of them. If you re not going to have marshals on patrol then you need to come up with a better system so that these spaces cannot be just parked in by anyone. If you are reading this and you are someone that parks in these spaces without children  please stop to consider why it is so necessary that you leave these spaces for people that need them!  Please share this post if you agree!;;;;;2016-03-18T14:29:13+0000;1458311353;2016-03-18 15:29:13;17;16;17;7;40;16;9;7;19;0;17;0;0;0;0;0;0

Smaller stores should be there for everyone offering a smaller selection of what you have in the larger stores. Why are poeple being charged more for the same product? The majority of poeple ( I would imagine) who use the smaller stores would be disabled  elderly or the less fortunate who can t travel to the larger stores without having a car. I think it is wrong that the prices are set higher  just for (and to quote one of your staff members)   for convenience  . It goes against everything Tesco stand for  every little helps .

Will certainly be shopping at Marks and Spencer just across the road.

Your taking the rules a little too far. It takes a bit more life experience to guess peoples ages so maybe staff those positions with someone who has a teeny bit of life experience  and vague interest in being helpful and nice to people (a base line level of customer service) would be nice too  not that I will be ever setting foot in a Tesco ever again.

The delivery I received today posed many questions...do you teach them to pack tins and jars on top of crisps?? Pack hot bread on top of each other so they get squashed???  Sending perishable goods with 2x days date?? Other orders have also been packed in a questionable way...ie..A 5x pack of baby wipes on top of 4x loaves of bread  as you can imagine the bread was not in a usable state. You have also sent me the most disgusting bag of grapes which must have been picked out of the bin  and expected me to have them and pay £3. I think not. I have complained many times about these issues and others to the customer services team but nothing changes. You clearly state that  as fresh as you d pick yourself or your money back  this is obviously not happening. As with many of those who have their groceries delivered  I am unable to do it my self anymore. What s the point of ordering your groceries online and you then end up sending half of it back because of ignorance (I can only assume).  I have now learnt that for me to get at least 1X usable loaf of bread I have to order at least 4x. May I suggest that train your pickers better or employ pickers with a brain.;;;;;2016-03-18T09:54:29+0000;1458294869;2016-03-18 10:54:29;11;4;11;2;17;3;3;0;2;0;11;0;0;0;0;0;0

We ordered a few weeks ago and when we chased delivery  we were told the delivery would be that Thursday (10/3/16). We stayed in all day on 10/3/16 and there was no delivery. When we chased  we were told that they  meant next Thursday  (ie today - 17/3/16).   Again  we dutifully stayed in doors all day. During this time  we removed our old sofa  which was broken in the removal process. At approx 3pm  we had not received delivery so my husband called to chase. This time when we called  we were told that they had attempted delivery  and no one had answered so they had left a card. No one had knocked and we certainly didn t receive a card.  They claim to have taken a photo of our front door which we are yet to see.  However  this still doesn t prove anything as the photo could have been taken retrospectively.  Somehow in the course of my husband complaining to your offices  our order was also accidentally cancelled!!  So now we are left with no sofa and at present you still have our money!  So we can t even order from elsewhere until this money is returned to us  which will be another 3-5 days.  We have 2 small children  a family room that resembles a  crack den   no money with which to resolve the situation  and a guest staying at the weekend who we had promised could sleep on the new sofa!    I would like to know how Tesco propose to resolve this absolutely farcical situation?!?   I hope that you understand what a difficult situation you have put me and my family in.;;;;;2016-03-17T21:30:16+0000;1458250216;2016-03-17 22:30:16;4;1;4;0;5;1;1;0;0;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

As I walked around the store he got more and more upset. I decided to use the self service tills for speed  as by the time I d reached the checkout he was inconsolable. He was so upset that I ended up getting him out of the trolley. At this point  Sophie approached me and told me to carry on holding my baby. She then scanned all my shopping  packed my bags and filled the trolley back up.  All I had to do was pay. She was a lifesaver today and I want to send my gratitude to her.

Tesco Everyday Value vegetable grills need to be brought back. They were a tasty vegan option that s not ridiculously expensive like most of the stock you sell that vegans can actually eat. I notice when trying to sort my weekly shop  that Tesco are frequently doing away with cost effective options online and replacing them with items that are 2/3x the price. That or not providing an alternative at all! Due to my disabilities I m not in a position to be hunting around grocery stores analysing labels looking for something edible. Once I find things I can eat and that don t require me to have to spend hours in the kitchen to prepare and cook I like to stick with them (adding to  not reducing what s available to me). It s very difficult for me when my routine is disrupted without notice. My days are hard enough without grocery stores making it harder to shop online for food. Come out of the dark ages British supermarkets and realise the world is changing and that you need to do more than offer 1000 varieties of pulped cattle and confectionery! A great number of people are going vegan these days either to be trendy  ethical or because it actually provides them some health benefits to cut out animal based products. If you can sell cigarettes and cheap booze on your website (very irresponsible) you can certainly make room for a vegan section!;;;;;2016-03-17T14:09:36+0000;1458223776;2016-03-17 15:09:36;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was informed by a young gentleman that they had one in stock with a set of games  The nathan drake collection   at £319.99. Phoned my partner who agreed he whould like it. So I asked for it to be placed to one side so I could go and collect the money for it from home (please note that I live on Halesowen  so dependant on traffic and when the bus turns up it can be a round trip of an hour) I return back to your Stourbridge banch  ready to pay  the young gent us no where to be seen  but an older gent is on hand to help and brings the ps4 out from the back area to be processed ( I presume the young gent is either on his break or finished for the day). However when I look at the box it doesnt show that it comes with the set of games that I was told it would do. When I asked the older gent he informed me that it doesn t and that if I wanted that one then to go online  also that the ps4 on its owm would cost £319.99 (same price with the game). I explained that the other gent had said it came with the game for the same price only to be told that it wasnt in stock and that was the only 1tb version they had in stock. When I asked if they could put the game in with it (after all I was told that was what I would be paying for)  I was told they couldn t and to go online  talk about misleading   if I d have wanted a 1tb ps4 on its own I could go to asda  game  currys argos and got it for around £300  but being as he was after this set of games with the ps4 then this was the best offer at £10 cheaper. Never the less I feel that sometimes your staff are either misinformed or giving out the wrong information   and this isn t the first time ive had this happen. But rather then disappointing my partner (who had  been saving for a while to buy one) I simply went elsewhere to get one. All I can ask is could you make your staff on the electronic department fully aware of what stock you have in as for me I wasted time to be told something different when I returned to your shop. :(;;;;;2016-03-17T10:26:00+0000;1458210360;2016-03-17 11:26:00;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Every week I have problems. From items being missing  to payment issues. To items that have a short date meaning the next day! My delivery was meant to be here between 3-4 it is now nearly 5 and I have been told it will be here when ever the delivery driver has done his last delivery. No time scale at all. Was promised by Cirencester store it would 100% be here by 4 when I phoned at 3:45. Spoke to someone from your delivery team and was told it s the banks fault and I need to contact them. I ve spoken to my bank previously and have been told there is no reason you can t take the payment. This happens every week. Was told they have tried to ring me ALL DAY- lies!  Was told there was no complaints department and no one I could speak to. After standing my ground I was put through to a manager who again told me it was my issue with the bank not tescos issue.

The nappy on my daughter is not even full when leaking simce buying these i have used the full 30 nappies which would usually last nearly a week since she does have nappy free days (she is 19 month) they have lasted 3 days. I am very angry as i had to go to another competitive brand and spend more money. I have since using your brand used double washing liquid and softener washing double the amount clothes and sofa furniture because of my daughter leaks which has used more electric causing more cost to myself and my husband.

Check his call logs  he is the one being economical with the truth  NOT ME.  Not that I can blame him not wanting to climb my steps.

Under consumer law  for this to have developed a fault within 6 months  the fault can be assumed to have been there when it was purchased. I could ask for a replacement or a refund.  My husband phoned Tesco Direct on 29th February and asked for a refund or replacement.  They said we had to deal with Hotpoint. When he questioned this  he was told that an engineer would have to call and look at it and this was the procedure they had to follow before any action could be done.  So an engineer came (nearly 2 weeks later).  He said he would have to order a new front panel and a new drum  which would take almost a week.  Husband phoned Tesco Direct that same day (March 10th) and told them what the engineer had said and that we would like a refund or replacement. Tesco Direct told him that it was nothing to do with them and that we had to deal with Hotpoint. WRONG! By law  the retailer is responsible. Tesco should be aware of this (I m quite sure they are).  We were told that my concerns would be passed to the customer care team and they would be on to it quickly and call us back within 24 hours.    Husband rang again and spoke to Dale (AAD3). He told him that they used Hotpoint as a ‘dropshipper’ and it was their responsibility now.  Husband told him that we purchased the item from Tesco (not a Tesco partner) and it was Tesco’s responsibility (by law). Asked when the customer care team would contact me but he had no record of my earlier call! He said he would check the recordings of the calls made when we said my call took place and would get back to us.  He rang me back the next day (March 11th) and said he had checked the call and we had indeed been told our complaint would be passed to customer care but this had not happened.  He apologised and said he would himself pass it to customer care and they would get back to us within 24 to 48 hours. He said he would ring the next day to ‘keep us in the loop’. It’s now 15th March and we’ve had no call from anyone at Tesco.  Been unable to use the dryer for nearly 3 weeks now.  Tesco are blatantly breaking the law by saying it is nothing to do with them.  I do not want major repairs doing on an appliance that was 4 months old when I reported the fault.  I have the right to a refund or replacement.  Tesco know this but just try to fob you off.  Will never buy items like this from them again.;;;;;2016-03-15T11:22:54+0000;1458040974;2016-03-15 12:22:54;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

To give you some background to this tale of woe  I purchased in good faith  a Hotpoint washing machine from your good selves in October 2015.  Having purchased many other white goods appliances from yourselves in the past  I looked forward to a smooth  hassle free and long lived ownership of this essential nay necessary; kitchen item.  Alas  as it turned out  we never actually received confirmation of delivery of the washing machine and it wasn`t until we actually contacted you to advise you of this  that we were informed you could not deal with this and we had to deal directly with Hotpoint.  Somewhere along the line  after numerous phone calls and a great deal of time listening to your delightful hold music  a confirmed delivery date was agreed  some 7-10 days after the original date.  Fast forward to the 21st February 2016 when  in time honoured tradition our (almost) brand new washing machine began to experience intermittent faults and a blatant refusal to operate.  No amount of coaxing  verbal abuse or whipping with a willow branch seemed to alleviate the issue.  “No problem” I thought.  “Hotpoint will sort us out.  No worries.”  Here begineth the problems.  Upon calling the number affixed to the front of the machine  we were advised by a rather dreary sounding customer services chap on the end of the phone that we could not and should not  expect anyone to come out and look at our issue for at least 8 days.  Nonetheless  he would be more than happy to sell me additional insurance cover  in case my appliance developed further faults down the line.  Why Hotpoint are training their customer service operators to sell insurance on a fault line is pretty much beyond me; nonetheless I digress.  As we were in no position to argue  we were forced to acquiesce to this proposal and looked forward to the forthcoming 8 days of dirty clothes accumulation.    Here`s where it gets interesting.  Shortly thereafter  I received a phone call from a rather cheery customer services rep to let me know that despite assurances  no one in fact would be coming out to repair the washing machine on the agreed date as the fault code we were experiencing would in fact require replacement parts  which  guess what. were not in stock.  Upon enquiring when stock would be available  the closest I could get was “soon.”  Excellent.  I love “soon”.  It`s what I often tell my children when they ask about a raise in pocket money. “Soon.”  It was at this stage that I had an epiphany and realised that the original purchase of the washing machine was actually through Tesco and not Hotpoint and therefore resolved to pass the issue to your good selves  particularly as Hotpoint were being about as useful as King Canute was turning back the tide.   Sadly  my misguided optimism in your ability to speed up the repair process or at the very least provide a definitive timescale  proved beyond your capabilities.  I`m not sure why it proved so difficult to locate a spare part but in my head I imagine a scenario akin to King Arthur attempting to locate a shrubbery.  A nice one. Nevertheless  both myself and my partner received repeated phone calls to let us know that parts were still not in stock but would be available “soon.”  I love that word.  I really do.  Soon.  We also received more than one phone call from you explaining that the service we had received was not what could and should be expected and that you were prepared to make a “gesture” following the successful repair  of our forlorn washing machine.  Needless to say  we were both on tenterhooks after being advised of this.  The extent of the gesture was to remain a secret though.  Nothing like anticipation.  I`m sure you can appreciate at this stage  being without a washing machine was beginning to incur significant difficulties  particularly when trying to find a clean pair of kecks to wear in the morning.  I`m no prude  but I do enjoy the feeling of freshly washed cotton (and sometimes satin) on my backside of a morning.  I`m not averse to turning the old Y-fronts inside out to get some extra wear but by this point  the situation was getting critical.  My partner however  is slightly less forgiving and refuses point blank to even consider turning anything inside out at any time.  She`s a keeper!  After a considerable delay  we received confirmation that the (by now) mythical spare parts had been located (hurray) and would be available for install on the 11th March 2016 ( a good 19 days after first reporting the fault).  I`m happy to report that  the mission was a success and our washing machine is currently operating at maximum capacity and my buttocks are once again clad in freshly laundered undergarments.   The tale of woe finishes with the “gesture.”  Whilst we are under no illusions that a gesture need be provided  following the conversations we had with your (very apologetic) customer services team combined with the length of time we have been without a washing machine  the gesture received is somewhat lacking.  When I say lacking  I mean non-existent. Nada. Nowt. Nothing.  Less substance than the contents of a partially filled whoopee cushion.  Not even a shrubbery (nice or otherwise). Needless to say  the whole experience has been particularly disappointing and it`s highly unlikely we will approach you for any future white goods purchases.  Or if we do  it`ll be………”soon”";;;;;2016-03-14T17:51:49+0000;1457977909;2016-03-14 18:51:49;69;21;85;9;115;21;14;7;15;0;69;7;0;9;0;0;0

I save my clubcard points  I use Tesco to fill both cars  we buy all our shopping from you on a weekly basis  we buy top up shopping from you  we purchase presents  we even have our car insurance through Tesco. Yet yesterday there was an issue with my card and instead of calling me about this Tesco decided to just not turn up. My delivery was due on my only day off between 12-1pm. I waited in for this and at 1:20 I called and questioned where it was. I was told that it had been delivered  clearly not as to why I was calling asking where it was. He then called the shop and they informed that the van had it and had missed it and payment had been declined. He came back to me and apologised as they should have contacted me. (My contact details being correct as I was contacted 3 times last week about my delivery being over an hour late) the man on the phone then explained that they had retried the payment and it was successful and the delivery was still on the van so I would be contacted shortly as to what time it was to be delivered. I waited and by 6pm realised that maybe the shopping I had now paid over £70 for was not coming.... Kids then went to school today  had to explain why there was no pack lunches and why they were to have school dinners  extra expense  then I had to go to work without breakfast and lunch  had to buy  extra expense. Came home to still no food and I called back up. The best bit still to come..... They would have had no idea that it wasn t delivered had I not called! And ......it wasn t to be delivered! And then the options I m given. Wait for it.... I can pay again 😂😂😂 or I can not have my shopping delivered. Let me explain. I can pay again and have the previous money refunded then they can arrange a delivery  I assumed for tomorrow  or I can just have my money refunded and not have my shopping. I know I was so torn as to which to choose I almost lost my mind with excitement. When I asked if he was being serious he actually said yes 😐 so now I m still without food. I have to go to a shop WITH my children 😩😩 and do a full shop load. I know it s done but for many years I have deliberately paid for a delivery saver and religiously arrange my shopping to be delivered as this feels me with horror with all your strategically placed products it costs me a fortune!!  On a more serious note though I am appalled and have cancelled my delivery saver and will not be shopping with you again. For a loyal customer  in fact any customer  to be treated like that is very very bad and irresponsible of a company like yourselves to do.;;;;;2016-03-14T16:20:28+0000;1457972428;2016-03-14 17:20:28;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Tesco is the supermarket that we use all the time and have done for many years  In fact  we even bought shares in the company.  Earlier today  my wife and I decided to try Tesco Finest Curries for our evening meal and chose Lamb Rogan Josh and Chicken Korma. We also purchased two large Samosas and two large Bhajees from the deli counter.  Sadly  the curries were bland and tasteless ( possibly the worst we have tasted ) but the rest of our purchases were equally sub-standard.  I am a supporter of Tesco but  on this occasion I had to share my thoughts.

She has a real big fear of anything coming towards her. Took an hour to try an calm her down.  Every little helps not in this account. Don t think I will be making the journey to use your stores.

I received my weeks of extra savings vouchers & week 1 runs out today. I ordered my food for the week today & when it came to paying & using my voucher it told me my voucher wasn t valid because I had booked a pick up slot on 14th March (day after it is no longer valid) This seems unfair considering I m paying today  a day it is still valid on. No where on the voucher does it explain that it has to include the delivery day also. I am therefore missing a £7 saving that I m entitled too for my loyalty to Tesco & continual use of my club card. I would appreciate an explanation on this as quickly as possible. Thank you.;;;;;2016-03-13T19:55:22+0000;1457898922;2016-03-13 20:55:22;0;5;0;0;5;5;1;4;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We were shopping approximately 5 minutes. We went to pay  but apparently we were not able to pay until 11am.  This is perfectly reasonable  however I suggested constructively that a sign could be displayed to make people aware (we were not the only people who wanted to pay) I was then told by a member of your team:   it s been the law for years love .   I m not even going to discuss how infuriating it is to be called  love  in such a patronising manner as though this is common knowledge  but more to the point it had nothing to do with the law  I was merely suggesting a sign could be displayed as there were at least 3 other groups of people who walked out behind us for the same reason - WE DIDN T KNOW.  I was further told that they had just done a tannoy announcement (which we had missed as we had just arrived) but the argumentative and passive nature your staff made no sense  I was merely suggesting to make it clearer. I spoke to your staff calmly initially  and suggested a solution for an evident problem and in return I was met my argumentative and defensive staff - I d hate to see anyone that had a genuine complaint or weren t constructive.   So might I suggest to you Tesco - that if you do want to allow people to shop before they can pay  just make it clear. There was NO suggestion while we were in store that we couldn t pay. If you watch your cctv footage of around 10:30 in the morning by the front doors of your store you will see numerous people leaving including ourselves.   I d also suggest training your Stockport managing  and retail staff in some customer service  I ve worked in retail for many years of my life and it seems your staff were looking for trouble or had given up on their role entirely - one gentleman who is supposed to represent your business didn t have a name tag or uniform and yet continued to argue with me and I had to ask him to listen  just to suggest the sign!   If I were in their position is at least be apologetic that a customer had missed this important information rather than patronising them  as it is most definitely the customers inconvenience not your staff s. Hopefully you will see the importance/usefulness of this information to your business unlike your employees that we dealt with today.   Look forward to hearing your thoughts   Lucy;;;;;2016-03-13T11:39:41+0000;1457869181;2016-03-13 12:39:41;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I bought the jeans to wear to a family party  I tired them on in store and I love them  they are comfortable and fit nicely! When I arrived at the family party the next day (which was 5 hours away from home) I noticed a large tear in the seem near the pocket  it was safe to say I was frustrated and upset that I couldn t wear my brand new jeans to the party. I exchanged the jeans the next evening at my local Tesco s (East Dereham  Tesco Extra)  but I left feeling aggravated due to the poor service I received - although I was able to exchange the trousers for the same size  I was treated unfairly and accused of  considerably wearing  the jeans  though the labels were attached and I had the receipt  luckily for me a manager was called and was more than happy to authorise an exchange due to the nature of the damage on the goods. I have now had the new pair of jeans for 12 days and am really disappointed to have just discovered a tear in the seem on the leg  despite only wearing them a handful of times. I absolutely love these jeans  they are the correct size and they fit perfectly  but they are clearly made with fabric not suitable for everyday wear/use. I would expect a pair of jeans that cost me £18  to last considerably longer than 2 weeks of light wear.   I am so disappointed as I often purchase clothes from Tesco  but will be hesitate when thinking of buying jeans from Tesco s again.   As these have been worn and because of way I was treated upon returning the original product  I am reluctant to go back in store to seek a solution  as well as being hesitant to seek a replacement after the issues I have encountered.   Please advise me on how I should address this complaint.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Phoebe;;;;;2016-03-12T15:11:31+0000;1457795491;2016-03-12 16:11:31;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am writing to you in the hope that you will be able to forward my complaint onto the appropriate department as I was just now unable to find the contact number on your website.   I love sweet potato. Words can not describe how much I love sweet potato. If I could eat only one thing for the rest of my life it would be sweet potato. Or cheesecake. It s a pretty close call  but I think sweet potato would win. Anyway  today I bought four  yes four  packets of the sweet potato chips with rosemary and thyme because I am meal prepping and as discussed earlier  I love sweet potato. Normally I would but them fresh  but I thought I would give these a go  because  who doesn t love a bit of rosemary and thyme?   Why do I love sweet potato so much I hear you cry? Sweet potato is extremely healthy   and plus I love the soft texture that comes with it. So imagine my upset when your packet says to cook the sweet potatoes at 200 degrees for 25-30 minutes and 45 minutes later my sweet potato chips are still undercooked and crunchy. I was not impressed. Furthermore  I have an additional 3 packets of sweet potato fries which have also served me an injustice. This is just not acceptable and poor advertising. And trust me  I know how to cook sweet potatoes  if you haven t gathered by now already.   I trust that you will take me complaint seriously and provide me with some compensation as a result of my lack of satisfaction.   Many thanks   Jennifer Eyers.;;;;;2016-03-12T13:31:02+0000;1457789462;2016-03-12 14:31:02;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I m now a new mum to a 4 month old baby girl and we absolutely love the F&F range  but I can t help but feel a little bit disappointed that there s still a lack of clothes for little girls that are designed with  tomboys  in mind.    Obviously my little girl has no say in what I dress her in just yet (poor thing!) but I d love her to take after me with all of the things I loved when I was younger.   Girls can love trains and robots as much as they love Peppa Pig and Minnie Mouse  and I think their clothes should reflect their interests. With that in mind  do you think there is any chance of introducing a clothing line from newborn upwards that might be more suited to this kind of thing?   I ve only found a few online stores that cater for girls that like pink AND dragons  but as I mentioned  we love the F&F range  and I d really love to have a more accessible   affordable alternative.  Please keep me updated if there are any plans to bring something like this into the range  I ll be first in line!

Strange time to open at a few minutes past 9.   Came back at 5 minutes past and it honestly looked like I d asked the lady behind the glass to skin her favourite cat by asking her to serve me.   Turns out she wasn t ready and needed  another 15 or 20 minutes.  Why open at 9  or a few minutes past as it turns out  and then not be prepared to serve your customers.   As it turned out  I managed to drive to Asda  get served by a nice friendly young lady  get home and make a brew  all before misery guts would have served me.;;;;;2016-03-11T09:39:53+0000;1457689193;2016-03-11 10:39:53;37;12;41;1;54;11;8;3;10;0;35;0;2;2;0;0;0

To you it s a drop in the ocean but to me  a student nurse  it s nearly £300.   That £300 could pay my rent this month  it could buy me 6-8 weeks worth of shopping  it could pay for a months worth of petrol to get me to my placement where I look after people just like you and me.    I ended up having to escalate a complaint of not receiving my shares 3 months after leaving with a similar background of false promises by emailing Dave Lewis. It s amusing how as soon a you involve the big boss  things get sorted fairly sharpish!   It s worrying how hard a company such as yourselves make it for previous employees to get what money they they re owed as I imagine that some people would just accept that they re not going to get it.

After the call I received an email saying my collection on the  03/05/16 had been cancelled so i assume somebody got the dates wrong for that days collection  so today I once again waited in from 7am-7pm rang someone to double check and was told i was definitely on the list  then it got to 7pm and nobody had been to collect my FAULTY tv. I have now waited in for 3 days. So Tescos  Im obviously annoyed by this  and now I want to know what your going to do? I don t really want to talk to your customer service department again and i really don t want to waste another day waiting in for a driver who may or may not turn up  I would also like my money back for the faulty TV you sold me;;;;;2016-03-11T00:21:15+0000;1457655675;2016-03-11 01:21:15;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

One of the main reasons to visit the store this evening was to pick up the new James Bond film and use the “100 points when you buy any DVD” coupon. The item was scanned by Rachel almost in the middle of our grocery shop and just passed straight down  this was then put in to one of our own bags that we had brought along for packing. At the end of the scanning of items Rachel gave us the total price and we handed over the coupon to redeem our free points  at this point Rachel advised us that we hadn t bought a DVD or Blu ray and so we could not have the extra points  I pulled the film out of the bag and showed it to her  then  much to my amazement she told me “Well  that hasn t gone through my till  YOU must have just put it straight in to your bag without paying for it.” I protested my case and told her it had been scanned  she proceeded to tell me  in an ever increasing accusatory tone that I had bypassed the till with the item and that even the security tag hadn t been removed. Eventually she checked her monitor in front of her and said: “No it definitely hasn t gone through  you have just put it straight in your bag.” so Rachel took the film  scanned it and removed the security tag  we paid and as I had already seen the item listed twice on the receipt (once at the very end and once in the middle of the itemised bill) I showed Rachel the receipt and the fact the same item HAD been scanned twice and therefore I had not bypassed her scanner. An apology was not even mentioned  instead she called one of her colleagues over  Helen  and said “I ve made a boo-boo and scanned this twice” No apology for basically accusing me of attempting to commit an act of shoplifting. To say I was upset would be an understatement. To Compound this even further  and my secondary complaint  Helen (one of the ladies who patrols the areas by the tills just in case of queries) laughed at me when I expressed my displeasure at being accused of attempted theft. Helen told me (after laughing) “Rachel has been here a lot of years she wouldn t mean it like that” I m not really too fussed if Rachel has been there two days or twenty years  to accuse someone of theft  when the evidence is clearly available on screen and on the receipt  is beyond anything I have experienced before from a customer service focussed organisation such as yourselves.   I myself work as a manager for a large industrial solutions and supply company and have to deal on a daily basis with some of the largest blue chip companies across Europe  if I had shown such a poor attitude to my customers  as your staff have shown towards me and my family this evening  I would be losing contracts all over the place. And more seriously  if I had accused some one of trying to steal from me without valid grounds or checking first  I could be facing legal repercussions also.  The only thing I can say is that the young lady at customer services who did credit one of the films did apologise for any inconvenience  but by this point I had had enough. I made my feelings clear (in a polite manner) to all that were involved  but I feel that two of the individuals  Rachel & Helen  clearly were not very focused on their customer service skills  or  general manners this evening  and  as a consequence I am not at all a happy shopper.  Yours Sincerely Stuart Skelton;;;;;2016-03-10T22:06:38+0000;1457647598;2016-03-10 23:06:38;25;21;29;17;67;21;13;8;15;0;24;0;4;0;0;0;0

I ordered my Tesco.com shop to be delivered between 8pm and 9pm on Tuesday. At 9pm I received a call to say the driver was running late due to  staffing problems  and he would be with us between 9:30pm and 9:45pm. At 9:50pm still no food shopping so I called the helpline and they tracked down our order which eventually arrived just before 10pm!!! The driver had no paperwork with him therefore I did not know if there were any substitutions  omissions or short dates!!! There was no pda available for us to sign for the order. The driver said a manager from the Worksop branch would call us the following morning (Wednesday) to discuss the issues.   By 6pm on Wednesday no one had called us so I called the helpline to be told no call back had been logged. The operator could not get a response from the store so be logged a call and I was PROMISED I would receive a call from the store today. It s now 8:15pm  I have not received a call and no one has answered on your call centre for 20mins!!!!   I have had to use my email of items ordered to check all our shopping was present  this took a substantial amount of time!   We have shopped online with Tesco for nearly 2 years and I do not feel you value your loyal customers!  I think ocado may be receiving a new customer!!!!;;;http://tesco.com/;tesco.com;2016-03-10T20:15:18+0000;1457640918;2016-03-10 21:15:18;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

They would have been very ill.  I defrosted the other pack today. I was dubious about this pack. When I opened them they were the same. Really not good. I had to go out and get something else for dinner.  Again not good  a mile walk to the nearest supermarket  another mile walk home. After a day at work I wasn t happen I had to go back out. I complained before and was given a £5 gift card! If I was a pensioner and eaten those I d have been quite sick. To offer a fiver for something so rancid is a joke.  I was told that was more than tesco would normally offer.  When they were brought they went straight into my freezer so it s not like I had them sat around.

I arrived for my 3.10pm appointment however due to an online booking error as I hadn t realised that I needed to confirm through an email link to verify my booking so  I was not on their system. The staff on duty were very welcoming and tried their best to fit me in between appointments however the customers were arriving for their appointment slots and to save me waiting around a lovely colleague named Leanne very kindly got me a free drink and chocolate bar with a magazine to wait in the cafe until an appointment came free before the 4.50pm slot that I was now booked in. Her personal skills were impecable  she is such a credit to your store and a valuable addition as I believe that she has only just been transferred  from the Blackpool store a week ago. She sought out to ensure that I had a relaxing wait and as a busy mum herself she realised an hour or two away from motherly duties is a luxury. It so happened that somebody didn t turn up for their appointment so I was seen a bit earlier. I had my eye test and purchased my first pair of glasses with the help and encouragement  of Leanne.  I would definitely recommend  Tesco Accrington Opticians for their professionalism and excellent person centred approach to customers. Please can you ensure that this message of appreciation  is relayed back to the store. Thank you and regards  Miss Aimee Smallman;;;;;2016-03-09T17:08:30+0000;1457543310;2016-03-09 18:08:30;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have noticed this in its extremity today.  I am a frequent visitor to Sainsburys cafe. However  today I chose to visit the Thetford Tesco branch for my lunch to see what they had on offer.  As you enter the cafe  it seems to have a nice atmosphere  looks clean and seems laid back enough for the casual luncher. Unfortunately  looks can be deceiving. Behind the counter were four of the most sour faced people I have ever met. They looked like they had just been told the Bank Holiday was not being paid  all future Christmasses were cancelled and their favourite puppy had just been hit by a bus. They didnt dare to make eye contact lest I ask them to do something for me and  despite standing there for a good 5 minutes  I was not even welcomed with a  hello  or even a  be with you in a minute  despite my being the only customer there.  The person on the till at least looked me in the eye like a fellow human being and smiled when I d paid for my Chili Con Carne  offered me a cup for my soda and told me my food would be brought to me. She was the cheeriest of the bunch and to be honest had she not have been so welcoming  I would have turned on my heel and left.  When my food arrived  I was taken aback. It looked worse than hot dinners I had mournfully eaten at school. The Chilli Con Carne should ve been called Chilli Sin Carne (Chilli WITHOUT meat.) I mean  to be fair there was a relatively large amount of sauce  but there was nothing that I would call meat in there. Some beans which broke up the monotony of eating a meal someone without teeth could ve swallowed but no actual meat content. There was a lot of spice in there too.....and I eat hot curries but I think the aim of the Chilli Con Carne is that you are still meant to be able to eat the sauce without the insides of your mouth peeling off.  As for the rice? It added as much to the dish as a piece of parsley balanced precariously atop a pan fried venison - but at least the parsley looks good. I have chewed rice cakes that had more moisture than that which was in the rice I was served today.  All in all it was such an underwhelming and disappointing visit that I wont be darkening your door step in the future  choosing instead your more orange cousin for my lunching needs.;;;;;2016-03-09T14:18:29+0000;1457533109;2016-03-09 15:18:29;1;4;1;0;5;4;2;2;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

After paying i realised the money had not been taken off and I queried it with a member of staff who said it is based on the whole shop and not individual items! What is the point of that? Anyone can shop round several supermarkets and work out that buying different things in different shops is saving money. The whole point of the brand guarantee is so that you can shop with peace of mind knowing that you will never pay more for ANY item and without the hassle of shopping round! Especially when starting a new business profit margin is very important. I am very disappointed in tesco and will not be shopping there anymore.

I was upset to find zero changing facilities in the toilets. I had to change my newborn on a disposable mat (which I was so glad i had with me) in between the sink area in the ladies.

Wanted to exchange my Dulce Gusto machine as it was faulty.    When I was at the service desk I pressed the buzzer for help. I waited for a few minutes and one of the assistants came  completely ignored me used the computer and walked away.  I pressed the buzzer again  again waited for another 5 mins when the same assistant came back.   I explained that the coffee machine was faulty and produced the receipt.  The assistant looked at the receipt  took the the machine out of the box and told me I would have to call the customer service number  because I was out of the change your mind guarantee.  I explained that I hadn t changed my mind  the unit had been faulty for weeks and I was just looking for an exchange. I was told to take it away and call the number.  When I explained I work unsocial hours as I work for the emergency services and it is not easy for me to wait in for things to be collected.  I specifically brought it into store as this was easiest option and I had someone take me as I don t drive and couldn t manage on the bus.  I am very disappointed I would have expected better.  When I eventually agreed to go home and call the number as the assistant could see I wasn t happy with this option I was told you can speak to a manager if you like.  I was soo disappointed with the service and attitude   I packed the coffee machine up myself as the assistant couldn t work out how it all went back in. If she had no intention of exchanging it why on earth did she take everything out of the box.  I did not want to speak to a manager in store as  shouldn t have to  to get a faulty item exchanged.    The machine was purchased just after Christmas 2015 and broke in February 2016.  I have spent a lot of money purchasing pods and accessories for it.  Not impressed Tesco won t be purchasing anything else like this from you!;;;;;2016-03-08T21:21:18+0000;1457472078;2016-03-08 22:21:18;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Google is actually penalizing them in the SERPs because of that. Also  first time in my life to see a supermarket charging for their click and collect service. Why should someone pay for collecting items from your store? Moreover  they have free delivery for a shopping basket that s more than £10  but you have to sign up with Tesco first  and you can only enjoy that free delivery if you sign up for their monthly paid service which costs a xxx/month. Finally  if you want to buy items from different sections from the store  there are separate delivery charges for their delivery  which means the delivery for the items that we needed would cost as much as the items themselves  and these items are not available in our local stores.

A few months ago (maybe october/november time) we bought a 9 month - 11 year cozy  n  safe car seat from tesco direct  paid for with boost points.  My 22 month old son has now grown out of the harness at the highest setting  but is way too young/small to just be wearing the seatbelt. I have messaged cozy  n  safe through their facebook page and emailed them on their website to see if they can help me (asking can I put the straps over the top of the back of the seat instead of through the top holes? or would that be dangerous? Is there some setting I m missing on how to use it? etc) I had a couple of replies through facebook a week ago promising to phone me and haven t heard anything. I never got a reply from their website.  Can I take the car seat back to Tesco? I don t have the reciept  but I think it should be in my order history on tesco direct. It s not fit for purpose if I now cannot use it until my son is 4 and can use the seat belt!

I ve been going there every week since Easter eggs first appeared on the shelves in search of dairy free eggs for my two children who both have a milk allergy  but there haven t been any at all.  I asked at customer services today and was told that they probably weren t getting any this year. Last year there were a few different ones to choose from in that store  which is just a couple of minutes walk from my home. The lady at customer services did offer to check stock elsewhere but that isn t much use when getting to other stores is a problem.  I know the Trent Vale store isn t the biggest one around  but surely it could stock at least one free from Easter egg option?!;;;;;2016-03-08T18:32:52+0000;1457461972;2016-03-08 19:32:52;0;5;0;0;5;5;1;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

At approximately 22:10 this evening a Tesco home delivery van turned up to deliver what I can only presume based on the volume of food was a entire weekly shop however this is completely irrelevant. What is relevant however is where the delivery driver choose to park his heavy van. He parked on a grass verge outside the house he was delivering to. Due too the recent heavy rain when he tried to pull off from the grass verge he became stuck. After a short wait backup arrived (another delivery van) and towed him to safety leaving a VERY large trench dug into the grass verge. I trust the council will be notified and sent to fix the problem created by your very experienced drivers.

Another checkout was opened but too late for me as I d already loaded my shopping. I have complained about this for before  it improves then goes downhill again. There were many staff on the shopfloor replenishing shelves- it really needs more multiskilled staff who have the ability (and authority/initiative) to hop on a checkout as needed. Also more management actually on the shopfloor. I hope that the reduction in opening hours means that staff can be deployed better to assist customer service.

I regularly shop in one of the tesco express shops (Woodside street  Coatbridge  Lanarkshire) and the staff there are excellent. As a wheelchair user  each member of the staff go out of their way to help and assist me with all my needs. They are polite  courteous  cheery and extremely hard working. They all take the time to chat and if I ve not been in the shop for a few days  they always ask  on my return  if I m ok  if I ve been ill etc. We regularly hear of bad customer service  but this is certainly not the case in the Woodside Street shop. Each member of staff are ambassadors for your Company and you should be extremely proud of them. A special mention for the young boy who regularly serves me (unfortunately  I can t remember his name). He is a lovely  cheery young man who goes out of his way to help and nothing is ever too much trouble for him. Congratulations to whoever interviewed and hired the staff here  they did an excellent job and I hope each and everyone of them continue to be there and serve me for a very long time. 👏👏👏👏👏;;;;;2016-03-07T18:19:50+0000;1457374790;2016-03-07 19:19:50;27;15;27;6;48;15;7;8;16;0;25;0;0;0;0;0;0

Parents dont use these spaces because we are lazy but to allow space for us to take children and babies in car seats out of the car easily and without damaging other vehicles. If the spaces were at the other end of the car park we might actually get to use them instead of all the lazy ********* taking them first! Oh and if you have a car seat in your car but no child with you  that shouldn t give you the right to use them either.

One example I can give you is the Genius seeded soft rolls. £1.50 in morrisons (regular price  not special offer)   but the same item will set me back £2.40 in your store! Nearly £1 more per item!

About a fortnight (possibly longer) ago I bought one that was on your reduced section for  £1 as you were stopping selling them in this store. I went to the checkout and it said item not on file so the very helpful lady asked for a supervisor. The supervisor took the item and passed it to a colleague who was just passing to find a price and she went back to just standing there.  About 10 minutes later (no exaggeration) the colleague handed the item back to the supervisor and the supervisor approached me and asked me where the item was so I told her. I then told her I had bought one before from the store and it was reduced. I said to her it was £1. She looked at me and said it wouldn t possibly be £1 more like  £4 or more. I got awfully embarrassed at this point as people were looking.  She then went on to say she can t sell the item as she wasn t sure on the price.  Which is fine I understand that. What I couldn t understand is why your supervisor for the store needed to embarrass me so much on a busy Sunday morning. I felt like she was accusing me of lying in front of all these people just for the sake of a few quid.   I m not upset I couldn t have the item. Not at all. I m just upset that a member of your staff embarrassed me so much.   The checkout lady who was very helpful and apologetic stated even full price the items were not £4.;;;;;2016-03-06T14:53:02+0000;1457275982;2016-03-06 15:53:02;0;4;0;0;4;4;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

It was finally delivered on the Monday.  I actually was so despondent with the level of service from Tesco that I vowed never to use you again.  However  after conversations with the Manager at the Hanley Branch and reassurances from  yourselves  plus I was extremely pleased with the products when they eventually came and the amount of shelf life on  them (I feared I would get items nearing there sell by date  which most definitely was not the case) I agreed to give the online shopping another chance.  Today I have my order  arriving between 8pm and 9pm...  Ready for me to  begin cooking for Mothers Day first thing.   Guess what?  I have just received a telephone call from the Tesco Hanley Branch to inform me that they are very sorry but they have missed off and forgot to load items from my order...  mainly the chilled  which included the chicken and many other items for my planned mothers day meal!!!  They cannot sort it tonight now but will TRY to get  it to me tomorrow  hopefully 2pm!!!! What is going on please?  Another Sunday and plans ruined courtesy of Tesco.   It really is not fair  or ok.   I feel so frustrated with your service and absolutely silly for giving Tesco another chance only to have the same mistakes made at cost to me and my family.  I really feel that there needs to be a review of the online shopping within the Hanley Branch and I would like to know how this mistake has happened yet again.  I am also aware that  I was not the only person last week to not receive their shopping.  I was informed there were 12.  Incredibly shoddy practice.;;;;;2016-03-05T20:52:42+0000;1457211162;2016-03-05 21:52:42;4;12;4;0;16;12;4;8;5;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

As it was lunchtime I decided to buy a steak and kidney pie from the fresh section  when I got home and started to eat it the middle of it was frozen solid!?

I explained to you that I have only been buying these in bulk every few days for the  2 banana flavour yoghurts in the 6 pack as it is the only food that my autistic 6 year old will eat and sadly as I discovered yesterday you have discontinued this flavour. I had 27x6 packs delivered and when I phoned yesterday I was told that a delivery driver would pick them all up today as obviously my son will not eat them now. So I was told I would get a phone call to let me know roughly what time this would be. I have kept them all in the fridge ready to be collected and returned and my money refunded. So I have been waiting on this all day and no phone call or Tesco delivery van have come to pick them up as I was assured would happen. Fortunately for me after buying several brands and flavours of yoghurt in the hope my child will eat one he has picked up on Sainsbury s cherry yoghurt which he used to eat but dropped. I have to go out tomorrow and buy Sainsbury s entire stock from my local store which fortunately for me is in the town I live. I therefore will be needing the room in my fridge and now am going to have to bin  the £27 worth of yoghurt that you were supposed to have picked up today and am therefore £27 out of pocket so thanks for that. Every little helps? I don t think so:;;;;;2016-03-05T18:37:10+0000;1457203030;2016-03-05 19:37:10;1;6;1;0;7;6;1;5;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

There are lots of teenagers at the end of each till asking do you need help with packing with a begging bucket taking up valuable space in the end of the till where shopping goes to be bagged.  You say no and they just stand there at the end of the till making it impossible to easily get things in your bags and then into your trolley and leave you in a situation where you have to angle your trolley at some insane angle totally blocking everyone’s easy route to pass you as they have concluded their business with you  I ended up asking the one in my way to move.  The  little helpers  then spend the next 5 minutes gazing at you awkwardly as you try and pack.  Finally after managing to pack my items and pay I am then onto the next frustrating part of the shopping experience.  The checkout operator proceeds’ to waste mine and every other customers time (I literally heard someone call a code RED which I think meant the tills were getting slammed at the time) explaining your Tesco brand guarantee and scribbling a circle around the fact that I had saved £2.33 over your competitors  she seemed surprised I had not seen the ads (I do not watch TV) but thought it an appropriate use of everyone’s time to get onto that topic for a moment.  Then she asked if I wished to take a customer survey online to gain a chance to win something (I had pretty much lost the will to live at this point and stopped listening to her).  Then after all this she then proceeded to wave this bucket of red tokens at me as a final try to waste even more of mine and everyone else s time and I really have no idea what she was going on about at that point as I had lost my final bit of ability to stay polite and just turned around and walked away.  I am not quite sure what your motto of Every Little Helps means exactly but every little bit of your customers time is important.

Coupons printed by your own tills too?  I was so frustrated this morning when I presented the cashier with a voucherfor Nappies  and asked if she could scan it to see if it goes through. First she said it will  but when I asked her to double check because they were pull up pants  she changed her mind and out right refused to scan the coupon to check for me.  She insisted the coupon would not work because I had pants and the coupon said  Nappies .  I kept asking her if she could just try to scan the coupon to see if it works  then finally she turned around to discuss it with the cashier behind her  in her own language.  It seems because that cashier told her to give it a try  she finally decided she actually would.  At this point I was ready to move all my shopping and find the manager if she wasn t going to scan this coupon.  In the end the coupon went through and she didn t even apologise for making a big deal out it for 5 mins   what would have been the harm in just trying?  This isn t the first time I ve had problems with your staff being stingy with money off vouchers so i just wonder if this is something you make them do  like avoid using them if there are variations with words to trick your customers or something?? Really takes the mick especially as I go there often to find products discontinued or out of stock.

A few months ago I bought a packet of pens (Staedtler Triplus Fineliners  10 Pack) that were secured by a safety alarm of which I was not aware of. Arriving home I placed my pens into the drawer  forgetting about them in the meantime. Coming across these pens again just recently  I realized I could not open them and returned to the store last night at around 8 pm  in which I had purchased them. Upon arrival I immediately approached the security guard (named something like Apher) explaining my situation. He then tricked me into giving him the packet  claiming I had stolen them. He would not give them back to me. I was angered and asked him to call the manager (Charmaine). She told me that unless I had a receipt  I could not get my pens back  also implying that I had stolen them. Now I am left with no pens  no receipt and no proof at all. The manager was not willing to understand my situation  nor engaged me regardless of the situation having occurred due to an initial mistake by an employee  who did not remove the safety strip in the first place. Afterwards she merely dismissed me  claiming she had another customer to attend to.  I am angered due to the fact that my pens were taken from me and that I was accused of being a thief. The company has no right to confiscate my pens without any proof of me having stolen them (which I would like to stress that I did not)  or even without any proof that I purchased them from Tesco. I demand that the pens I have paid for are returned to me. And that the employees at the Hackney store are briefed about the presumption of innocence and their legal rights to confiscate items from customers.;;;;;2016-03-05T14:05:18+0000;1457186718;2016-03-05 15:05:18;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have had the same issue with a product being out of date since October 2015. The product in question is walkers spicy mix ups. Practically every week since last October I would go in to the leatherhead store and find at least one bag out of date. Today I went in to store and found 11 bags out of day with the oldest being 12/12/2015!!!!!!!!!!  Each week I would take the out of date crisps off the shelf and hand them to a member of staff to make them aware. So two weeks ago I thought that this was not getting resolved in store so called up the help line hoping this would get this resolved. Finally speaking with the store manager of the leatherhead store today  she had not been informed of any complaint nor had she been informed of a problem from any of her management team. I have seriously lost all confidence with this company and if anyone wanted to complain to the customer services helpline  most likely you will be made to feel that it s a product issue and not a staff issue as this would be because if it was a staff issue  it would give the true complaints figures for the company. I then mentioned today to the telephone customer services manager (Gareth) that I could post something on social media to make other people aware of the issue and he said there is nothing to stop you doing that so here is my post. Please check your product dates when buying stuff in store as Tesco will not refund you if you take the product back to store. The only positive is that a telephone customer service manager Gareth seemed to understand and true to his word did investigate and called me back as promised. Time will tell if this get resolved. Confidence has certainly been lost with this company!;;;;;2016-03-05T13:17:24+0000;1457183844;2016-03-05 14:17:24;3;4;3;1;8;4;3;1;3;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

Having had the Fridge-Freezer delivered  it was immediately apparent that the item was not as expected. It was smaller than imagined and not fit for a family  despite being advertised as a family fridge-freezer. With only two shelves  it would not be suitable for our needs.   Thinking this would be fine  as I had purchased online and knew I had 14 days in which to return an item  I called Tesco.   I was told that I had purchased via a third party being Appliances Direct and given their number. So  I called them.   They informed me that I did have 14 days to return the item  but would have to do so at my own cost and they were based in Derby or Huddersfield! Having obtained courier quotes (most commercial couriers won t take kitchen appliances  as I found out!)  we were shocked to find that it was going to cost £140 to return the Fridge-Freezer!!!!   Obviously  we have to purchase a new Fridge-Freezer  and do not have an additional £140. At no time in the purchase of the Fridge-Freezer through your website was it made clear that any return would be at our expense.   We are a hard-working family and feel we have been treated wholly unfair and are now out of pocket by a considerable amount. This is not a great reflection upon my opinion of Tesco!;;;;;2016-03-05T08:12:40+0000;1457165560;2016-03-05 09:12:40;3;26;3;0;29;26;10;16;8;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am very unhappy with your home delivery service yet again.  They constantly turn up very early and unload their vehicle before knocking on our door half hour early some weeks. As we have a baby this is not convenient. Neither is the fact that they could not find a convenient subtitution for some vegetables today. We usually buy pre chopped bags  carrots  broccoli  cabbage and a mixed bag. Today I received 1 whole broccoli to last a family for a week. How is there no loose carrots as a substitute for example. I now have to drag my baby to the shops which defeats the object of home delivery!  Not happy with this service yet again and I would like to see this sorted.

I make a minimum of 4 visits a week to this store. I work in retail and I am aware of the pressure put on members of staff. Working in retail I am aware it is clear that customer experience is what increases customer loyalty. Unfortunately  it seems as though customer experience is not a high priority within this store. I often use the tobacco kiosk within the store  I spend a minimum of 15 minutes waiting to be served. There is a clear lack of communication within the store as there is only ever 1 member of staff on the kiosk  I have been in the store with 20 people waiting to be served at the kiosk and there has never been a member of staff to support the kiosk  it is evident the store is run in departments and not everyone is trained or employed to work on this area however  if it is that there is only one person capable to process the tills on this area within the whole store at one time then this is a serious issue within a large store that senior management should be extremely disappointed in. It is an area where customer service is vital which has been let down on many points.   On the 04/03/2016  I came to the store with my sister and her two year old child and 8 week old child. With a distressed and hungry 8 week old child we wanted an easy shopping experience which is something I would expect from Tesco. I needed to purchase a few items (bottled drink x2  cocktail sausages  chicken bites  cigarettes). My sister needed two packs of Huggies pull ups and Cow and Gate baby formula. As I needed to purchases cigarettes and we both had less than 10 items (which is stated in an unprofessional  poorly made  hidden sign above the kiosk) for convenience we thought it would be easier and quicker if we both completed our transactions at the tobacco kiosk. We waited patiently in the line as it continued to grow to a minimum of ten people. As the lady in front completed her transaction the member of staff (Ginny) proceeded to continue her conversation with the customer  stating her unhappiness with the company and her dislike to her job. I was eventually served  the member of staff did not engage in conversation with me nor was I offered a carrier bag  my items were rushed through the till. As my sister stepped forward to purchase her 3 times  the member of staff made a negative comment in a negative tone  you two are sneaky  this was completely unnecessary  after my sister asked what the member of staff implied by her comment she repeated her previous comment  that was just sneaky . I was completely disgusted that she felt  it was acceptable to make this comment in front of a two year old who was very aware of the dynamic and atmosphere.   On a previous occasion  involving the same member of staff. I entered the store at 06:50 am  Ginny told me she could not serve me until 07:00 am  I had no problem with this. I stood and waited  Ginny then engaged in a conversation with another member of staff. At 07:00 I waited as she continued her conversation  I did not want to be rude so I continued to wait. At 07:08 I asked if she would serve me I was told it was not 07:00  when I told her the time she pulled a face and rushed through my transaction.   I am thoroughly disappointed with repeatedly receiving poor customer service within the store. I have previously not mentioned the poor quality of customer service that I have received as I am aware of what happens within stores  however  as this is something that repeatedly occurs it needs to be addressed.;;;;;2016-03-04T18:02:00+0000;1457114520;2016-03-04 19:02:00;3;1;3;0;4;1;1;0;0;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

Just had one of your drivers at my door shouting at me in front of my toddler. This is not great customer service at all. I must have been 5 mins late home from the school run and he had been and gone. I phoned up at 11 to ask where my delivery was and was told they had already been but noone was in but would be back out to me in 20 minutes. When he arrived he straight away started on me that he had knocked and I wasn t in and was shouting at me.

I have to say your customer service is amazing when you’re selling your products its first class couldn t be more helpful. My complaint is the aftercare I’ve received....  I purchased a Samsung S6 champagne gold online on the 16/01/16 came within the week I couldn’t wait to use it although because I spent all that money on it I thought I’d invest in an otter box defender case  as I had to wait for my case to be delivered my new phone sat in the box as I wouldn’t trust myself with a phone that cost me £399.97.   Once I got my cover the phone came out of the box and I couldn’t have been happier with it up until a week ago when my phone started to freeze and not respond then decided to switch itself off and not come back on.  Tonight I rang you’re company asking for advice and was told it shouldn’t have gone like that and to take it to a local store and would be given a replacement  so I got in my car and took the phone over to one of your branches at Knoocknagoney  Co Down Northern Ireland… this is when my opinion of Tesco changed. I explained the situation to one of your colleagues and he rang you’re support team on advice of what to do  once on the phone it was explained and I got an absolutely ridiculous solution to the situation. I was told that there is nothing you could do for me  I wouldn’t be getting a new phone in replacement of the broken one  I wouldn’t be getting my money back  instead I would have to send it to your repair shop to get it repair which would take 2-3 working days for a package to be delivered to me that I put my phone into and return it to yourselves to be fixed which would take 10 days  then I would have to wait for the phone to be returned. This isn’t good enough the phone is less than 2 months hasn’t been used from the date I collected it.  I spent my hard earned money on a phone that doesn’t work correctly  I can’t get an exchange  I’m not entitled to my money back to go and buy a new phone  I now have to wait days on this box getting to me.  Then go for 2-3 weeks without a phone…  I need my phone for work. When I asked about a replacement phone the lady from your company said “use an old one  there is nothing we can do” if my old phone was functioning I wouldn’t have spent all that money in the first place and I wouldn’t be in this predicament.  To say I’m fuming is an understatement  absolute disgrace spending all that money on a phone and knowing that if I get the phone back from repairs it will be a refurbished phone that wasn’t working for someone else so in fact I’m getting a second hand phone in replacement for a phone used for 4 weeks!  Future reference I won’t be buying another phone from yourselves neither will my family and friends and I hope that this is read by other customers and is taken as a warning that if your phone stops working after 14 days of purchase you might as well have thrown your money away… next time you need a new phone go see Apple. The most unhelpful  disappointing  disgusting  time wasting customer service I have ever received.

I was called forward with my items so I passed the items to the server Stephen and he started a conversation the customer to my right...he didn t ask if I wanted a bag but speaking to the other man he filled the bag with my items.  The other customer had then been served by someone else and was leaving shop still talking to staff member serving me. I bleeped my own clubcard as I was not spoken to I entered my card details and forgot I needed another item. Whilst I was still standing there waiting to ask him could I have batteries he still carried on speaking to this other customer that was leaving. I said excuse me but are you serving me? What s with the attitude he said to me... you had attitude as soon as you got here.. I said excuse me? I said you called next person and I walked up with my items  you never asked if I wanted a bag you spoke to that fella and did not once ask me anything or give me eye contact so how could I of given you attitude. I am reporting you to head office I said.. go head was his reply.

Everything seems to be as usual until I reached the cashier with loads of my supplies when I heard that there are no medium  most common plastic #bags at store at all. Sounds like a not big problem  but this is not the first time! I had the same experience twice in City Centre and once at #Douglas  which are two biggest stores in Cork region. So today I bought 4 small bags instead of 2 medium  and in my previous experience I had to buy bags for frozen food and those extra large. Every time I had to buy something that I don t need and had to pay double for it.  As I spotted big enough paper bags sitting at the another counter and ask for those I been told that they are only for customers who buy clothes (?) Since it happen often I can not believe at word  sorry  we are out of bags  as I mentioned  it is about hipermarkets. If you look into the figures and math is seems that district managers pumping up extra sales with that old fashion sales method in 2016  which is dishonest to the customers and makes me ask my self.. What are the Tesco s (Cork) company values? Is that way of making extra profit environment friendly?

My daughter scooted into store and he marched after us and demanded that I give him the scooter. He said that my 4 year old was not allowed to ride her scooter  I said we ve never heard this before after several years of scooting in there...and he replied  I work here now  - I refused to give him the scooter  I had to say I would carry it 3 times before he stopped and walked off.   It s not unreasonable to ask her not to scoot but his manner was extremely rude and verging on aggressive. He walked away and my daughter burst into tears. I saw him by the checkout and told him he d made my daughter cry and he pushed past me and marched towards her. I ran back and blocked him with the scooter and he tried to push past me. I said 5 times  do not go near her  while he pushed to get past me to my daughter...and eventually a cashier left her post to intervene and tell him to leave us alone.   She is 4  not a shop lifter.   sent to Tesco store customer service.;;;;;2016-03-03T14:26:41+0000;1457015201;2016-03-03 15:26:41;1;6;1;0;7;5;1;4;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Last Tuesday I discovered a sharp piece of Perspex - triangular and fairly large in size - in an in-store blueberry muffin which was ordered as part of an online home delivery. This item was in a muffin my five year old son ate; luckily he realised that there was something in his mouth that shouldn t have been. However  I dread to think what would have happened had he swallowed it. I contacted the appropriate departments and can confirm that a gift was sent through with my next home delivery. What I m unhappy about is the promise of calls to update me on this situation - none of which have materialised - and that despite chasing an update myself I have been  in my opinion  fobbed off. This is an extremely serious incident  which could have had unforetold consequences and I naively expected more from Tesco to be honest.

One of your tesco employees stood with the lady while another employee went to get her a trolly with a wheel chair.  Unfortunately there were none available but she returned with a normal wheelchair.  The two lady employees then helped the lady into the wheelchair.  What happened next made me smile  one of the ladys then pushed the woman around tescos in her wheelchair while the other pushed the womans trolly and helped to get all of the ladys shopping.  They also packed her shopping and took her outside and waited for a taxi for her.  They helped her into the taxi and helped put her shopping in the boot.   I just wanted to let yous know that these two ladys deserve a huge pat on the back they took that extra bit of time and consideration to help a customer in need and show genuine compassion to make sure she was ok.

The customer car park has room for about 40 customer cars and backs onto one of the main roads into the centre of Exeter  probably about 15 - 20 mins walk from Exeter Centre. The car park was full  I nearly didn t stop  as I assumed the store would be busy and queues at the till  I was going to go to Co-op 2 mins drive away but I specifically wanted the Soup offer.  A car pulled out of a an awkward car parking space at the side of the store and I drove into it.  I had found the only car parking space available.  I was stunned or should I say flabbergasted to find out that there were only 3 customers in the store.  The Manager  think he was called Arek  explained that there is no sign up saying customers shopping only or 30 mins maximum  to stop non customers parking there.  One driver parks in the car park everyday and then walks to work  saving £25 a week perhaps on car parking.  All the streets around there  are now residents permit  as drivers were using them for free park and walk to work.  People park in the Tesco car park and walk to work  go to the Doctors surgery  go to Wetherspoons across the road which has no customer parking or shop elsewhere down the road.  This Tesco car park needs signage  limiting parking to customers only 30 mins maximum while you shop in store and some kind of parking attendant.  Bottom line  I thought the store was full due to lack of parking and wouldn t have stopped unless I specifically wanted the soup.  Arek the manager said that he had spoken to a  driver who used the car park all day  parking in the same space daily  explaining that the car park is for customers  not a park and ride  the driver just said  what you gonna doing about it  - word has got round you can park all day  for free - full car park and empty store.  No way can you compare this stores performance and sales targets with other Tesco Express until you sort out the parking fiasco.;;;;;2016-03-02T13:29:04+0000;1456925344;2016-03-02 14:29:04;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My children are grown up now but i would like to make a request....in your stores maybe you could allow children to eat free fruit /veg whilst their parents are shopping along with perhaps a small bottle of water.  Believe me sometimes you cant shop easily with children and an already stressful outing becomes even more so.  I think this would be a fab idea as long as children were monitored by their parents to avoid any choking issues  and would encourage healthy earing from an early age ..... this free healthy food should be offered at fast food outlets too to provide a balance between naughty and nice.

The girl said the barbecue was lovely so I told her to put that on. It was disgusting & actually tasted more like HP brown sauce instead. The whole family were disappointed as it had to go in the bin. I can t understand how a store like Tesco can run out of tomato sauce for a pizza when they sell Lorry loads of the stuff. I was out of pocket by the price of the pizza plus I had to get another tea for the family.

Today I did a weekly shop in your North Harbour store.   I was extremely disappointed with the half empty shelves that appeared to be there today. Now I m guessing Wednesday is your delivery day due to the gaps in products   As a full time parent  husband and shift worker  today was my only opportunity to complete the weekly shop and I m now finding myself having to visit alternative supermarkets to complete this task (which I struggle to tolerate at the best of times).   Can I also bring to your attention the rudeness and lack of respect for other shoppers some of your staff have. The personal shoppers you employ clearly need some training in manners and customer services. I lost count how many times I nearly got run over by those trolleys they use and pushed out of the way whilst trying to complete my shop.   Maybe I could have dealt with this a bit better if I was to have been able to buy the watermelon that I had spent 10 minutes searching for which you had run out of or couldn t be bothered to restock and also the 10 mins I had spent searching for the tea cakes that again appeared to be missing from your shelves.   In the current climate of trying to save money and retaining customers I would have thought an organisation like yourselves really should be doing more.   A very disgruntled customer who is now considering other options.   Phil;;;;;2016-03-01T18:01:45+0000;1456855305;2016-03-01 19:01:45;2;2;2;0;4;2;1;1;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

My car insurance renewal was due today and  and I find myself asking why oh why did I renew with Tesco! I really should have known better..... I received an e-mail this morning with a link to download my documents.... Several attempts later  I gave up! The system kept telling me that I may have entered the wrong date of birth or postcode. Now I may get lots of things wrong in life but these really are two pieces of information which I can confidently say I am sure about..... when I was born  and where I live! So two phone calls later to Customer Support and I am told that apparently the leap year is to blame  their systems have been struggling since yesterday. Customers who have requested their policy documents by e-mail will have them sent in the post instead. I was then told that if I want them electronically once they sort their problem out I will need to ring to request them!  So a couple of questions Tesco      I Understand that sometimes unforeseen problems occur with online  systems.But seriously if this is due to the leap year  it can hardly be seen as unforeseen can it? It comes around every four years.....Did you not see this coming?  Was there any customer testing of your system in preparation for this? And secondly why oh why do I have to call back to get my documents electronically  once you sort your system out? Would it not be good customer service to re issue them electronically as a matter of course with an apology for any inconvenience caused?;;;;;2016-03-01T17:18:53+0000;1456852733;2016-03-01 18:18:53;0;4;0;0;4;4;3;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

You really do need to go back to the drawing board with this bread as the amount of salt in it is disgusting !!!! and its so bad for you  so our verdict is 0 out of 10 and its been put in the bin where it belongs   I could not even use it for the birds for fear of killing them .;;;;;2016-03-01T11:22:20+0000;1456831340;2016-03-01 12:22:20;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I would very much like to send my thanks to the man who went above and beyond to help me during this crisis. A small act of kindness made all the difference to such an otherwise awful day.;;;;;2016-03-01T11:02:14+0000;1456830134;2016-03-01 12:02:14;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I d got a flat tyre and couldn t get the wheel undone  I was beginning to panic about how I was going to get the kids home and as we were stuck on a country road  in the dark  in the middle of nowhere obviously my children were getting very distraught thinking we d be stuck there forever. Your delivery driver drove past us and seeing us broken down stopped too see if we were ok  after explaining that I couldn t get the wheel undone and whilst I was trying to reassure 2 children that they would get home your lovely driver offered to help. Not only did he manage to get the wheel off  he also changed it for us and chatted the whole time to me and my children calming us all down and even had the children laughing by the time he d finished. I managed to find out his name was Tony and he was from the Banbury store  please could you pass on our families gratitude to him and make sure this lovely man gets the recognition he deserves. He really went above and beyond for us tonight when I m sure he was probably busy with deliveries but still made time to come to our aid. Thank you so much Tony  you re a star!!!
