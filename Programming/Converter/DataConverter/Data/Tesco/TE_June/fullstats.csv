Your Colchester store said they couldn t look it up as wasn t bought there. I even had the receipts as proof! The only thing  Tesco  would offer me was a  goodwill  Tesco voucher!!!! All I wanted was a refund or a new Asos voucher! Why is this such a challenge!? Any help would be appreciated.

We decided to visit the Café for some lunch and grabbed a table and I went and ordered our food.  My son has major sensory issues and because of this can get upset and scared at noises and sounds that you or I wouldn t even notice. It could be a hand dryer  a hoover  a coffee machine or something we aren t even aware of.  I could tell on our visit that his anxiety levels were rising and I put it down to the coffee machine being so loud and the fact that it was going off quite regularly. The Café was getting busy which could have also contributed to his stress levels.  My son started to get upset and stressed which meant he was becoming louder and people were starting to look over at us. A very nice member of staff named Rachael came over and informed me that I couldn t have my meal as the chef hadn t prepared any that morning. She told me that I would be refunded for this error and so I received my meal for free which I thought was great customer service.  She told me to pick anything else that I wanted from the menu. After taking my order she came back with everyone else s food and I had to wait longer for mine. This made my little boy even more anxious so I gave him my iPhone to watch in the hope that it would be a distraction for him. Normally if we are out and about and he gets upset  he will watch cartoons on my phone and be much calmer.  Today it wasn t working and his anxiety levels peaked and he went into meltdown mode. He was extremely upset and stressed out and was shouting and screaming very loudly. I noticed people looking over at us and I guess its part and parcel of having a son on the spectrum but it doesn t make it any easier.  My daughter was also becoming bored and anxious which made her cranky and upset. This makes my son even more stressed and it also made me feel pressured to calm him down. We tried everything with him: talking to him  singing to him  tickling him  distracting him  giving him the iPhone but nothing was working today. Most days  one of those distractions works but not today. I genuinely felt lost and was ready to get up and walk out without having my lunch. Then the very nice lady called Rachael walked over and approached my son. She addressed him by his name (as she had heard me talking to him) and got down to his level and placed a little booklet in front of him.   It was a free Tesco Healthy Eating booklet which were on display at the till and it had stickers inside it so you can create your own farm. She handed the booklet to my son and asked him if he would like to do some stickers. She opened the booklet and showed him the stickers and almost immediately he stopped and looked at her and said  stickers . My son doesn t use many words so this was massive for him. She spent a few minutes calmly talking to him.  I thanked her for what she had done and proceeded to help my son with the stickers where he created his own farm. He sat there for the rest of our meal  happy until we had finished.  I called Rachael over and thanked her for the way she dealt with my son. When everyone else was staring and his anxiety levels were rising  she came over and gave him 5 minutes of her time. What people don t realise is that what she did would impact the rest of our day. If he would have remained in meltdown mode then we would have had a horrendous day with him but just a little thinking outside the box and offering him her time made a huge difference and gave us a happy boy.  She told me that a friend of hers teaches children with additional needs and that she recognised what was happening with my son. I think this is absolutely fantastic and this lady changed the course of our day just by being understanding and giving him 5 minutes of her time. In a situation where I was getting stressed out and wasn t sure of what to do next  she used simplicity and diffused a challenging situation.  I would like to publicly thank Rachael for doing what she did. Not many people have an awareness or an understanding of Autism and it can be very challenging and scary for people on the spectrum and also for their families.  I would like this message to be passed on to her please so that she is aware how grateful we are and I think you should be proud of having a member of staff like Rachael in your Failsworth store. All staff should have some basic training in dealing with people with additional needs. At the end of the day its a customer facing role and your customers are all different and every store should be an inclusive store.  Thank you Rachael.;;;;;2016-06-30T21:07:13+0000;1467320833;2016-06-30 23:07:13;3522;333;3865;813;5011;330;286;44;602;0;3488;315;21;2;2;0;0

This is not how to treat your customers Mr Tesco ☹️;;;;;2016-06-30T13:57:39+0000;1467295059;2016-06-30 15:57:39;0;6;0;0;6;6;3;3;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have a 6 month old and a three door car  I need the room to open my car door fully to get him out  that and somewhere to put my pushchair.   The amount of lazy people parking in the parent and child spaces when they don t have any children prevents me getting my son out the car safely and  without damaging mine or someone else s car.   I have raised this in store and they said it isn t enforced  nor is is disabled parking.   Sainsburys enforce their parking to ensure everyone who needs a space gets it.   Is there not something you can do to prevent this?;;;;;2016-06-30T08:51:39+0000;1467276699;2016-06-30 10:51:39;0;7;0;0;7;7;3;4;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

This afternoon  having just picked up my car from its MOT  I popped in to Tesco in Bursledon to pick up a few bits. Unfortunately when I went to leave my battery was completely flat. I have to admit that I panicked a little! It has never happened to me before and I didn t know what to do. I had let my membership to the RAC lapse and when I called them they said they would charge me £130.00 to come and jump start my car! As a last resort I went and spoke to TINA at customer services. I explained the situation  fully expecting that they wouldn t be able to help me. Little did I know that you employ such wonderful people!! After trying and failing to call someone  TINA went on a mission to see if there was anyone who could help. She returned with SIMON from dot.com (I think). He had jump leads in his car so was going to jump start me. I seriously wanted to kiss him!!! I was parked in a bit of a tricky spot so he decided to try to push me to a hill and try and bump start it. With the help of a kind man in the car park he succeeded!! So thank you  thank you  thank you to TINA and SIMON. There are some good people out there and today I met two of them. Hopefully this will make its way to them so they can see how much I appreciate what they did for me.;;;;;2016-06-29T20:56:12+0000;1467233772;2016-06-29 22:56:12;20;6;21;0;27;5;1;4;0;0;18;1;0;0;0;0;0

The 3 sheds some to just over £1000  They could have said there s a surcharge towards it Staggered that a company the size of Tesco accepts this from their suppliers Glad to know they re obviously busy enough to turn away orders and satisfy a customer!

Right since the store was first opened I have written to you many times  and commented here and in my surveys that a foot access on the north side would make much more sense; the way you constructed it  every single foot customer had to walk across your car park  sometimes negotiating with your delivery lorries too.  Thank goodness that as from now all customers coming from the north will not have to walk in your car park at all; and customers coming from the south now have the choice whether to take a chance crossing your car park and delivery bays or whether to walk a few paces further north and walk in complete safety around the newly constructed  pavement .     Out of interest  I wonder if you would consider letting us know how many accidents to people on foot have been reported in your car park (though I appreciate that some would be drivers and passengers getting to/from their cars).  I also appreciate that not all incidents would have been reported  not to mention  near misses ...... big big thanks for making your premises that much safer!";;;;;2016-06-29T12:04:11+0000;1467201851;2016-06-29 14:04:11;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was little more excited at the prospect of my delivery due to this fact  as I am sure you can imagine.  I have 2 things to report to you. 1. The delivery driver was marvellous  happy  friendly and extremely helpful. Something which has brightened my day. Been stuck in the house since Sunday so was nice to see a smiling face. My order number is 220388216  if this helps you to get a message back to him!  2. Unfortunately not great news for number 2. After the joy of my delivery it appeared to be snack time for my little (nearly) one year old girl  Arienne. Imagine my dismay when her favourite kingsmill pancakes were not there? Thankfully her being only 1 years old she seemed happy enough with a hot buttered crumpet so all was not lost (currently on offer 2 for £1.20 may I add for the readers benefit). Anyway  I m not after a refund as its only a couple of pence but thought I d bring it to your attention. Had it been my nappies it could have been a different story. No nappies for arienne would have been a disaster of first world proportions  can you imagine?  Anyway  please try and pass my thanks on to Mr delivery man and tell if he comes across the pancakes  he s welcome!

I fancied something different today  I knew what I wanted but couldn t seem to locate it so thought I would ask one of your (usually) helpful and friendly staff...  Firstly  with this day and age of self scanning handsets I would NEVER assume that because someone was holding a hand scanner that they worked in the store.   Secondly I wouldn t assume that someone wearing a navy blue jumper worked in store either. (Unless Tesco have a trademark on that exact pigment that I was unaware of) especially as they don t say  Tesco  on the back.  So back to the story... I see this older lady wearing a navy jumper while scanning products and I wasn t entirely sure if she worked in the store. After a few failed attempts to check if she had a name badge or anything on her that may indicated she was in fact an employee  I thought I d just ask.   excuse me  do you work here  I said  with the friendliest consumer smile on my face I could manage at 9am.  She responded by holding the scanner up to my face and saying  WELL DUH?   Never been made to feel uncomfortable by a member of your staff before  but I think this encounter will stick with me for a while.  Manners... every little helps.;;;;;2016-06-29T09:06:53+0000;1467191213;2016-06-29 11:06:53;23;17;32;4;53;16;7;9;16;0;21;0;2;3;1;3;0

Whilst at the same time part of the link road was shut. Already causing tail backs at the main roundabout. Tesco staff continued to stop traffic by the garage to tell each individual car the store was closed. Causing more tail backs onto the main road. Very frustrating as not all cars are visiting Tesco. Alot were actually going to Argos or Wickes. When we advised of the issues with the traffic the Tesco staff were very rude and ignorant. They seemed under the impression they were doing some sort of traffic job when in fact a simple sign saying Tesco Closed would have been sufficient. Or even stopping cars as they enter the Tesco carpark. It would have also saved us the 15 min waiting time.

We were at the self scan checkouts so I was very aware of holding up the queue and I couldn t abandon my shopping and go to the toilets to tend to him.  A First Aider was called and David  a gentleman we usually see on the security desk came to our rescue.  To say he is a credit to you Tesco is an understatement  this man was beyond kind to my son.  Josh can become a little worried when he suffers a nose bleed and David kindly took him to one side and sat him down whilst I quickly scanned the last bits of my shopping. He sat with him for over 15 minutes until his nose had stopped bleeding  and then proceeded to clean him up from head to toe despite me offering to do it he told me that was no problem at all. David joked with Josh throughout the exchange  making light of what was a worrying situation for Josh. When Josh failed to understand some of his banter and I felt I needed to explain that Josh is autistic  David explained to Josh in a way he could understand. If you could pass on my thanks once again  and to say that Josh spoke about his kindness all the way home and will remember that act for a long time coming.;;;;;2016-06-28T17:35:51+0000;1467135351;2016-06-28 19:35:51;2687;163;2864;192;3219;161;130;31;313;0;2661;170;6;0;0;0;0

What particularly appealed to me was that it was magenta (I already have an older kindle).

The fruit and veg manager and a young lady called Emily from the chilled section. I requested to speak to a manager about some dried up spilled yogurt that was on the shelf in the fridge. My reason for wanting a manager was that I had previously mentioned this yogurt twice  once on Sunday and once LAST Tuesday. As luck would have it the lady I spoke to last Tuesday was the Fruit and veg manager from today. She quite rightly was disgusted that a week later I had to complain again. She offered me some free yogurts and was very apologetic (even though it wasn t her section). And Emily although not her mess was happy to clean the shelf there and then  both members of staff were friendly  helpful and willing to go out of their way to put it right.

Just want to say a massive thank you to 2 of the friendly men and the lovely lady who was working today. You did more than i could ever ask for. After getting stuck in a lot of traffic up at Luton Airport and running very low on fuel I couldn t find any other petrol station. I actually ran out of petrol just before the pump on the forecourt (partially blocking the entrance). I firstly asked a stranger if he could help me and hes response was if you cant find anyone else then i will have to but i am running late. The next man i asked just point blankly refused. Now feeling very emotional and angry and upset i went in and just stood in front of the tills where the lady serving (sorry didn t catch her name) asked if i was OK. i explained what happened and i was trying so hard not to cry :( she immediately buzzed for a colleague who got another gentleman and they came to my rescue without hesitation. I am so glad they were there because my car is to heavy for someone like me to push.  I am so grateful for these 3 members of staff that i wish i could do something to show my appreciation.  Thank again Tesco Harpenden  Love Hayley Theed (the lady in the stranded car);;;;;2016-06-28T06:25:51+0000;1467095151;2016-06-28 08:25:51;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

When I checked my order details I noticed that ide made a mistake and I had actualy ordered them for collection from Crowle. I phoned Crowle store and explained that I had made a mistake. The lovley Mr on the phone replied  it s not a problem I m from Goole. I finish work at 6 so I will bring the items with me for you to collect at the Goole store . He didn t have to do this but little did he know that today is my birthday and the item was my birthday gift from my husband and children. I didn t get his name but I wanted to show my appreciation and send many thanks. People are so quick to judge when something goes wrong. But praise where it is due always goes a miss.

My partner and I were in tesco Carrickfergus on Friday night.. We bought what we needed and inserted the card into self check out and left. We did not realise that we had either left the bank card in the machine or dropped it putting it away. We noticed on Saturday that the card was missing and remembering that tesco was the last plus that we had used it  went down to check.  We went down and the girl at the check out at customer service confirmed that the card had been handed in after checking ID .. However due to in incident happen else where in the building no one could access the card for us at that time. She said we could either wait or come down the next day assuring is it would be safe as it was locked away.  However when we went down this morning to collect the card that was not the case. Tesco lost the card!! All the paper trail was there saying it should be there; all details of the card wrote down so clearly the card has been there however in the bag in which the card should have been held in there was no card! Sounds funny right  it s a good thing we noticed when we did. Right now anyone could have that card so we have had to cancel the card because tesco have lost it after claiming that it would be perfectly safe locked away!  Appalling behaviour and does not reflect good on them whatsoever!  Please check that you have your card before leaving!";;;;;2016-06-26T16:57:52+0000;1466960272;2016-06-26 18:57:52;7;12;9;6;27;11;4;7;4;0;7;0;0;0;0;2;0

Until this week that is. We were informed on the morning of our due delivery date that our order had been cancelled due to the money not being in the bank. So we checked our online banking to discover that £120.00 has been removed from our account  as it has gone to yourselves. Our first issue with this is that our shopping bill was just under £75.00. So the amount didn t even make sense. So my wife called customer services and spoke to a lady who basically said that it would be sorted by the next day. This would of been regrettable  but understandable.  (remember. Two small children.) The next day comes and no money in our bank  and no call from yourselves. So my wife speaks to the bank and you have our money  one of your customer service team confirms you have our money  but the lady dealing with this days that you havn t. They then inform my wife that the problem will be resolved Monday. We now have no shopping  no money and two children to feed. We have had to beg for money off friends and family  something I feel shamed to have had to do  just so our children can eat. But it s ok because you advised us that we would be  compensated .

I placed a online order a couple of weeks ago as I couldn t get out as my little boy was really poorly with Scarlett fever.   I placed the order for delivery the following day but realised that I needed the shopping sooner than expected as I was running out of cold things for him rapidly  he had a very very high temperature and I was doing all I could to get it down. I telephoned and asked if there was any chance I could get it on the very first slot the following day and explained the situation. The staff very kindly moved my delivery slot forward to the same day so that he had his ice lollies and stuff for his temp and delivered it promptly  within 2 hours! The delivery manager ever called me the following day to see how my little boy was and to see if I needed anything else.  So a huge huge thank you to your wonderful staff.  I literally had no one to get to the shop for me and you were all amazing- Thank you! Xx;;;;;2016-06-26T08:03:24+0000;1466928204;2016-06-26 10:03:24;12;1;13;2;16;1;1;0;0;0;12;1;0;0;0;0;0

A couple of days ago i visited a store with a view to buying a new tv. The first 2 stores were out of stock. At the 3rd store  they had the tv i wanted. Hooray! I took the ticket to the desk and the member of staff went out back to get it for us. 15 minuets later he came back out and said he couldnt find any but would speak to his manager about a discount on the display tv. We agreed  but as only 1 of the 15 or so tvs had a programme playing  i asked if the feed could be switched to the tv i wanted so i could check for any damage or dead pixels. This is where it went even more down hill. The guy serving us didnt know how to do it. And apparently neither did the other 6 members of the electrical department. Thats right.... 7 members of staff trying to get a picture up on the tv. After about 30 mins  my girlfriend suggested to them that they take the hdmi lead out of the working tv and plug that in. After another 10 mins and 4 staff not being able to do this  one of them comes out with a usb stick with a demo vid on it. He finally plugged it in  to find there were no files on it. Anyway  it was getting late so i gave in and just said id take the risk. 3 guys removed the tv from the wall  and one went to get a screwdriver to take the wall bracket off. 10 mins later he still hasnt come back  so i used my multitool and did it myself. Then they couldnt get it back in the box  so again i did it myself with them watching. I asked them if everything was there and they did check and assured me it was complete. Remote  yes. Stand  yes. Manuals  yes. Power cord  yes. Great. Lets go pay. The cashier then couldnt work out the 10% discount  so again  i told him what it was and the final cost. Took him a while to figure out how to use the till to put the new rate in  but he finally got there and i paid. Another nice man gave me a hand to take it to the car  as the girlfriend had got bored and did some shopping so had quite a few bags with her.  At 9pm  2 hours  yes  thats 2 hours after arriving at the store  we finally left with the tv. Got home went to plug it all in and guess what. The part of the tv stand that goes between the tv and the base of the stand was missing. Great. Called the store and after looking they said it wasnt there. So the discount i had for buying a used tv   was spent buying the adaptor for the stand. I shound have just gone to curry s and bought a brand new one from there!  Im just glad we didnt have our 2yr old daughter with us during this total farce. Thankyou tesco. Thankyou.;;;;;2016-06-25T19:10:39+0000;1466881839;2016-06-25 21:10:39;1;7;1;0;8;7;2;5;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have recently been on holiday to Norway and was pleased to see much food packaged in paper and card as oppose to plastic.  As I am sure you are aware a large amount of plastic enters the marine environment and has devestating and long lasting effects on marine life. Even a large portion of plastic that is recycle able  such as plastic bottles and pots  cannot be turned back in to the original product  therefore technically we do not recycle it but  down cycle  it. It inevitably end up in landfill where it can take hundreds of years to break down.  As I saw in other shops  products including pasta  cous cous  nuts  seeds  rice and many more came in resealable cardboard cartons. Bread came in paper bags  not plastic bags.  Paper and card are 100% recycle able  biodegradable and renewable  making them a cleaner greener choice.  Is it possible for you to switch to more sustainable packaging?  I hope you can spare the time to read this thoroughly and I look forward to your response. Thanks  John;;;;;2016-06-25T18:39:34+0000;1466879974;2016-06-25 20:39:34;4;4;4;1;9;4;3;1;2;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

I went in to the Banchory store this morning and after a long wait for assistance only two cushions could be found. It honestly seemed at that point that it would be left at that  but I had paid for 6  and so I persisted in trying to find out what to do then. I was told three different things -  only part order had come and they d follow    they may have been lost    they would have to re-order the 4 others   but nobody could confidently assure me there wouldn t be an issue if I signed for the part order.  Throughout all this everyone was adamant they were definitely not in the store. After 4 members of staff were involved  and a second check of the bonded warehouse was made at my urging - the other 4 were found.  Somebody had put them in the returns area  was the explanation apparently. Had I not stood my ground I may never have seen them  as it was agreed these might have been returned with having been put in the returns area.   Very unimpressed indeed  especially as the store is almost 12 miles away from my house and I had gone especially to get them today. I have made 4 trips to the store regarding these cushions  and that has cost me fuel and precious time. I was there almost 25 minutes this morning. This is NOT the service you advertise -  More Choice  Made Easy .  I hope this very unsatisfactory customer experience will be taken on board in an effort to prevent other customers experiencing the same poor service.;;;;;2016-06-25T18:26:33+0000;1466879193;2016-06-25 20:26:33;1;6;1;0;7;6;3;3;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Bought a Hudl2 last year that the screen cracked on whilst on charge after 11 months. As I had taken the optional insurance  I was advised to speak to them. They arranged a repair and the Hudl was returned  fitted with a USED screen. I rang to complain  but was told it was policy...  Lo and behold  a couple of weeks later the same thing happened. I rang to speak to them  to be told that they had  paid out the maximum under the policy  really? For a faulty used screen?  Wrote to Tesco as advised they couldn t take a complaint either over the phone out via email  which is surprising as we live in the 21st century.   Anyway  they emailed back saying they aren t interested and passing the buck to Square Trade  the warranty company.   Looking online there are numerous instances of this happening  and I am disgusted that not only did it happen  but that they used a screen taken from a 2nd hand item that is known to suffer with this fault. The fact that they obviously don t warrant a repair for any length of time is also not good. As far as I m concerned the Hudl2 is nether for purpose  not of merchantable quality. I now have an extremely unhappy 4 yr old son who doesn t understand why his tablet has broken TWICE.   I d advise anyone to avoid purchasing electronic items from Tesco as their attitude to problems is woeful.;;;;;2016-06-25T14:02:08+0000;1466863328;2016-06-25 16:02:08;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was in the process of purchasing alcohol when I was asked for ID  so I provided it  then my girlfriend was asked for ID even though she wasn t purchasing anything. She didn t have ID and we were refused the sale. Apparently it s policy to ask everyone for ID which would be fair enough except I was in the same store buying alcohol a few weeks earlier with my girlfriends 5 year old niece. I was asked for ID but the child wasn t. Where do you draw the line on asking for ID? My girlfriend is 23 and looks considerably older than her niece. This was very inconvenient and actually quite embarrassing as I was made to feel like I was purchasing alcohol for a minor.

She is registered blind  having enough difficultly already needing to be guided and helped to shop...when we reached the till I was assisting her to pay for her goods  her card is chip and signature  the woman on the tills refused to allow her purchases  as the back of her card was not signed. I explained her predicament and the fact that she had just got married so the other cards were in a different name. By this time my SIL was already reduced to tears at the checkout  we were asked to go and withdraw cash to pay but this was also unfeasible as her cards do not have a PIN number. I asked for a manager who also said as tescos policy they wouldn t allow her to buy her shopping. Fortunately I was with her so I payed for the shopping myself. But I feel tescos handled this situation wrongly and by such discriminated against a disabled person!

I was really worried though so I found a phone number for Tesco and miraculously got through to a real person who called the store and sent staff out immediately to check on him.

When in Tesco on my way to work today  the cashier asked me if I had voted  to which I replied yes. She then asked me how I voted  to which I told her. I didn t think this would be a massive issue - we all have our own opinions and that s ok  it s the way of the world and we can t all agree 100% of the time can we?!   I was very shocked by this cashiers response which was along the lines of  Oh my god  why did you vote that way? Should ve voted this way!   Please tell me lovely Susan (this wasn t actually her name but I don t know her name so she s now called Susan!) why shouldn t I have voted the way I did? Because it s the wrong way according to you? Because it s not the same as the way you voted? I m intrigued as to why it infuriates you so much that I have my own mind and today I actively used it by voting for what I believe should happen?!   As you can see I have left out specifics regarding whether I voted in or out. This being because it s no ones business except mine  I am not going to judge anyone on the way they ve voted today  or their reasons behind it. We are all DIFFERENT and INDIVIDUAL and that is what make us  us.  Rule of thumb for me from now on will be that I will NOT discuss my voting decisions; not to friends  family or strangers.  So thanks  Susan  from Carmarthen Tesco for teaching me to keep my mouth shut from now on  because sadly the world will always judge or have something to say about your views and opinions.   Over and out! ✌🏽️";;;;;2016-06-23T20:11:34+0000;1466712694;2016-06-23 22:11:34;1;9;1;0;10;9;2;7;9;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I had put a notice on the order stating that this was an important occasion but Tesco did not care. I phoned to complain and the guy I spoke to was lovely and agreed it was not right. I was refunded £1.79 but the money means nothing. one of our party had to go out to Sainsbury and buy new salad. I won t be bothering with Tesco again.

We were not in a rush to have it delivered and selected Saturday the 25th of June as a delivery day as a Saturday is the only day where one of us is guaranteed to be home.  On Wednesday last week (22nd June) my partner received a call from Arrow XL (the courier) to say that they were at our house. They were rather rude about the fact that we weren t in and had to take our furniture back to the depot. They claim they don t deliver on a Saturday so why were we able to select this option?  Since then we have been plagued by phone calls from extremely rude staff in this useless company  the latest of which informed me that I had to pick one of two days next week for the delivery to take place. I told them that after 1pm on friday would be the only time that would suit us and I was told in a rather sharp reply that they cannot guarantee a time.  I would ask that you as a company take heed of this and of the terrible reviews Arrow XL receive on a daily basis and stop using them as a courier.  Cheers.;;;;;2016-06-23T17:35:19+0000;1466703319;2016-06-23 19:35:19;2;3;2;0;5;3;2;1;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Last Friday my husband was doing the usual Friday afterschool shopping trip with or son (14  profound autism) he loves to shop  he waits all week to do it - it is actually used to help him manage his time and  wait for things  helping him also to manage behaviours and anxiety associated with wanting to buy things constantly. Accompanying him on this trip was his 8yr old brother. The trip started generally uneventfully apart from the couple who found looking at our son constantly an art in iteself  think it distracted them from thier shopping (i digress.... we as parents have travelled this road of educating the general public in autism awareness many times! ) The stinger on this trip was the securtiy guard  he was actually like some kind of shadow  he followed my hubby  my 14yr old (who is quite a vocal child with autism  lots of noises  hand flapping and pacing around shouting random words out for all to hear!) Tesco  this went on for the whole shopping trip  to the point that my husband asked him if there was an issue.The secuity guard was even waiting at the end of the checkout. Please note that our 14yr old needs 1-1 as he has no sense of danger so getting side tracked as a parent can be a problem! Lets not forget 8yr old brother who just coasts along on these trips and just  takes it on the chin  what random events occur when you have a brother with autism. My point here  I know i am rambling somewhat  the point I slept on last night was  we went back to store yesterday  me & my 8rd old. Do you know what he said!?  I hope the secutiry guard doesnt follow us mummy  he shouldnt though because we dont have my brother with us  Now Tesco  come on  this isnt the type of thing an 8yr old should be thinking! He has enough to deal with from the general public and their lack of awareness  I hope we have bought our children up to be kind  and compassionate little people who take in to account differences. Autism awareness  would the store like some tips? We have shopped in this store since our son with autism was a small boy  he has learnt to wait  be patient (doesnt always work) and to understand he cant always get what he wants  there have been times he has layed on the floor and flatly refused to move but generally staff  get it . I will point out here Mr Tesco that head office are aware of this event and they have asked the store to contact us  twice! it has been escalated but head office. They have so far not taken them up on this offer  sorry for the long post  I do feel better now I have got that off my chest! Look forward to hearing from you.;;;;;2016-06-23T08:37:29+0000;1466671049;2016-06-23 10:37:29;20;16;30;3;49;16;10;6;25;0;20;0;0;0;4;6;0

I would just like to praise this friendly  helpful gentleman.  Today he arrived a little early to find there was nobody home so he rang me and I explained I was on the school run but would be there within a few minutes. The man said don t worry he will start unloading and wait there for me to arrive. I got back at 9.05 and everything was all ready to bring in and the man was so enthusiastic and welcoming to my 2 year old.  He did not make me feel rushed or like an inconvenience and it was lovely to listen to his happy conversation and whistling.  So thankyou Mr Delivery man you cheered my day up! It s lovely to encounter someone so friendly and helpful.😀;;;;;2016-06-23T08:30:28+0000;1466670628;2016-06-23 10:30:28;5;7;5;0;12;7;2;5;2;0;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

As I was about to leave the store I remembered I needed Coca Cola which I brought back to the same person straight away as there was nobody else waiting at the till  I put my items which I first purchased back down by the till and said that I needed the cola as well   but still chatting to his friend and still without any acknowledgment I gave him the a further £2 for the cola and his words to me was  You are joking mate and the rest  at this I checked the price on the cola and I said it was £2 he said what about the bread and milk and I said I had already paid for that about 30 seconds ago and his colleague agreed that I had but the person serving said he hadn t served me. And to top it all off he said I over charge all the time my till is always up. The information on the bottom of my second till receipt was as follows   22/06/16. 21.35.  2382.  004.  6009.  6562  I look forward to your reply;;;;;2016-06-22T21:13:51+0000;1466630031;2016-06-22 23:13:51;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

After an unsuccessful visit to the store last night  where I was told the staff couldn t help at all  I contacted the team again. They spoke to the duty manager who assured me that she would sort it out for me when I went back in  Sadly  when we went in to the Leytonstone store today  the duty manager in question wasn t around  but we spoke to Sue on customer services. She went WAY above and beyond to help us. She sorted everything out  searched our clubcard purchase history and found the item.

I live in Wells Somerset and have a small child and it s convenient for me to pop into tesco about once a week. O handed my prescription into the pharmacy and they told me they could hold it for a bit. Went in today with a 7 months old with baby a double ear infection so was unhappy to be told they don t have it. I was shocked at this. They said someone must have collected it. I said they couldn t have. And the lady said I should call the doctor for another prescription. I said I was very unhappy because I know that no one has collected it. She said she could look through everything but would take a while and as I was concerned about it I said regardless of my grumpy baby I would wait. She assured me once again it would be a waste of my time to wait. Nevertheless I did. Within 15 minutes she came back with the prescription I had spend 30 minutes fighting to collect. Think this was very poor organisation and communication and will definalty not be using the pharmacy at any tesco store again!;;;;;2016-06-22T19:56:09+0000;1466625369;2016-06-22 21:56:09;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The concerned employee was concerned. The joking one was the manager on duty for the evening. He not only didn t care  he thought it funny some customer was going to get cheated.   This same shop has overcharged me on sandwiches in the past because they didn t obscure the original bar code.   Please  will no one do anything about complaints there? I m buying my lunch at Centra tomorrow. They cost more than your over charge  but at least I know I ll be charged the correct price. Since it s a locally owned firm  they actually care what customers think. Anyone at Tesco that cares  doesn t seem to be in a responsible position.;;;;;2016-06-22T18:50:09+0000;1466621409;2016-06-22 20:50:09;1;5;1;0;6;5;2;3;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Online order to Tesco for over £400 mainly for drinks for my big birthday on Saturday. Waited until 2 hrs past my time slot before contacting customer services  who informed me it had been cancelled due to security isues  possibly my bank. Tesco did not bother to let me know this so waited in vain from 4 untill 7. They cancelled despite me logging in with my password  and using club card vouchers  and my registered home address. I rang my bank who assured me they had not cancelled the order. The customer service assistant reschedued the deliverary for today  and said there should be no problem. I have waited in again  and guess what- no delivary. Stll on the phone to customer services for the last 15 mins because the store has cancelled the order again!!!!!!! Plus to add insult to injury the estimated cost of the basket has gone up by £20.

And still charged for the time slot i chose when it came out of those hours!!  Well today  I done a online shop last night to arrive between 10-11 am today and I m still waiting for said order. Iv had to cancel all my plans to sit around waiting for an order I m still waiting on baring in mind there is no food etc in the house hence an order!! And can t go out as no time has been given! Cheers for ruining a very rare day of which again I had plans!! I received a phone call this morning to say your truck had broken down and you ll be with me soon as you can! No doubt you have given everyone else there orders so why am I still waiting surly I should be a priority rather then the 10 customers after me.

Tesco’s Opticians  Addlestone I have worn varifocals for over 20 years and have been a customer of Vision Express Opticians for 15 years. I recently had my cataracts removed and now only require reading glasses. I had an eye test at Vision Express but wasn’t happy with the quote they gave me for a new pair of reading glasses  so I took my prescription along to Tesco’s Opticians in Addlestone  Surrey. I was delighted with their quote  especially when I was told that I would receive a 2nd pair free  so  on 8th June  I went ahead and ordered reading specs with transition lenses. I picked them up on 15th June  they were slack and weren’t fitting very well  the assistant held them over a machine that heated them up and I watched while she bent the arms round to make them tighter. I don’t wear the glasses very often  only when I am looking at my computer or reading but after the second day  they still weren’t fitting and slipping down on my face  I then noticed the arm on one pair was loose  so I carefully placed them back in their case and didn’t wear them again until I could manage back into Tesco today to get them fixed.  The same assistant  again held them over the machine and bent the arms to make the glasses tighter on my face  she then tightened up the loose arm. I asked her to tighten it up more because the arm was still loose. She had a look then told me that the arm was damaged so couldn’t be tightened up properly.  As the glasses were only a week old  I expected her to apologise and tell me that she would get it repaired for me  but she had the audacity to accuse me of causing the damage  she actually said I must have sat on them! I was so taken aback  then another older lady came in and asked if any small hands had been touching them  I told her there was only my husband and myself at home (we are both senior citizens)  and  in any case  no-one  but me  touches my glasses. She then said they had been forced  to which I replied  ‘Well  the only person that has been forcing and bending the arms is your assistant!’  Then the older lady said  ‘The end of the arms look like they’ve been chewed!’ She showed them to her assistant  and ignoring me  she repeated  ‘They’ve been chewed!’  By this time I was really upset with their absurd accusations  and replied  ‘So now you are accusing me of sitting on my glasses then chewing them? They rudely replied that they will send them back and the manufacturer will be able to tell! Quite honestly  I am speechless at how unhelpful and unpleasant both these ladies were! I have been a very good customer of Tesco’s stores both at Brooklands and Addlestone for 15 years and have never known any assistants or customer services to be so rude! They need serious training in customer relations! Initially  I was singing the praises of Tesco’s Opticians and the great prices  I was recommending them to my friends  but now I am thoroughly disillusioned and disgusted  your Optician s after sales service is appalling!;;;;;2016-06-22T15:09:44+0000;1466608184;2016-06-22 17:09:44;0;13;0;0;13;13;5;8;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Contacted arrow via its online chat this morning to be told my package was still with Tesco. Asked why the tracking number I was given shows my parcel is in their warehouse. Chat advisor Olivia told me they have only received the  paperwork . Strange as their website shows my package is  loaded ready for delivery . I asked if it was Arrow or Tesco that sent me the text telling me my delivery details. She said it could of been either. So I have no idea where my package is but I don t believe for one minute that a delivery slot would of been generated when arrow only received the paperwork for my delivery. Why would arrow receive only paperwork!! If it doesn t make sense its usually a load of rubbish right!?!

How the staff put up with it I don t understand. Grabbed the four items I wanted and headed for the checkouts.   I asked the lass supervising the tills if there was a manned till. She said no and indicated the self service block  to which I objected.  I am sure I heard her say  It isn t difficult . Yes  it s not difficult at all but it is highly unpleasant.

My daughter loves My little pony and as a reward we purchased on Sunday these knickers. Today she wore them for the first time and to my horror tonight before we took a bath I found welts on her skin. She is 3 years old and has been wearing 4-5Years since feb. She hasnt gotten fat because not long ago we purchased F&F boxer knickers to our surprise these were too big! Please explain how is that branded goods like Hasbro mlp is too small for her and the F&F too big?mind you theyre supposed to be the same size?? My child isnt fat so why do we pay extra for these name brands and they wedge into the child s skin????;;;;;2016-06-21T20:56:22+0000;1466542582;2016-06-21 22:56:22;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The receipt clearly states that it is a Tesco guarantee  however 2 years after I got it the television broke. For the past month I have visited several tescos who have given me a different number not tesco  and on phoning this number the man I have spoken to was very rude and told me I have to get it fixed myself and pay for the repair and then claim the money back from them. On visiting your irvin store Scott at the electrical desk gave me fabulous customer service and tried to help but was told tesco s hands are tied. I strongly feel that I have been miss sold this as i bought the television under the impression I was getting it with a 5 year guarantee with tesco  your offer is very misleading and I feel you should let your customers know what they are getting. I cannot afford to get it fixed so this guarantee is useless to me;;;;;2016-06-21T19:59:56+0000;1466539196;2016-06-21 21:59:56;4;4;5;0;9;4;2;2;1;0;4;0;0;0;0;1;0

Not so much with yourselves but with some of your inconsiderate customers.   It concerns your trollies. Specifically  the dual child seat twin trollies.  These trollies are great  allowing us to shop one adult per two children with ease! However they are very limited and do not require persons to put in a pound to use them and thus are subject to misuse.   On numerous occasions  almost every visit to be honest  we have witnessed people using these trollies  not only with single kids  but with no kids! We observe people using the child seats to separate their veg  their bakery items  hang clothes  heck even to organise their wine! White in the left seat red in the right! I do not joke!   I assume these people think they are clever  getting away without having to have a pound coin but I think it rather inconsiderate of others. I m sure some innocently did not have a pound coin on them  or forgot their little keyring jobby! Most  I m certain  know jam well what they do  as these trollies are stacked out of the way to the side of the store right to the back! Other people probably don t even know they are there!   You see we have two year old twins. When me and the wife visit the store together and no twin trollies are available it is not so much of a problem  well not for us anyway  we just take a normal trolley and a child each and off we go  getting in everyone s way as we go  taking up double the space in the aisles I m sure annoying many others. It is still however slightly frustrating to see others with no children using them even though its not a massive inconvenience to us.    It is when my wife wishes to visit alone with the girls and there are no twin trollies. This is where we have a big problem. As you can imagine a shopping trip alone with two year old twins is difficult enough even with the twin trolly  nigh on impossible without!! I challenge you to try it!  It s got to a point where my wife literally feels that she cannot visit the store alone through fear of arriving only to find that no twin trollies are available.   I must stress that this complaint is not entirely directed at yourselves  mostly so at the people misusing these trollies.   I must convey deep and utter disappointment to these people and their lack of thought for others.   I ve been close to stopping these people in the middle of the store to demand they swap trollies! If we encounter many more I feel I may snap and start doing so!!   All sattire aside there must be a remedy?   I know it maybe of massive cost for you to implement the idea  but I  as I m sure the other tens of thousands of parents of twins up and down the country  would happily have to put a £2 coin in these trollies  to prevent their missuse. We already pay double for everything else baby related! Why not the trollies too!  Yours respectfully   Ben Austin  Proud father of beautiful twin girls;;;;;2016-06-21T18:23:01+0000;1466533381;2016-06-21 20:23:01;20;15;20;3;38;14;2;12;9;0;17;0;0;0;0;0;0

One item purchased recently was mincemeat which previously I would have purchased the  value range  & have never had a problem with either the quality OR the taste  I found that the above store no longer are stocking this & opted for the next cheapest option which I found absolutely awful. It was very fatty & gristly & would NEVER purchase again! Also I find it very difficult to purchase goods with more than a couple of days left on  use by dates  - not so in other supermarkets. So with this in mind Tesco you have lost another customer who has shopped in your stores for many years.;;;;;2016-06-20T18:07:24+0000;1466446044;2016-06-20 20:07:24;1;5;1;0;6;5;1;4;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

The tesco clubcard key ring states on it  If found  please hand into a Tesco Store and we will do our best to return it     I discovered today when enquiring if my lost keys had been handed in  that  doing your best  is keeping them in a drawer on the off chance that someone happens to ask if you have them.  I was told there was no central recording system so I would have to go to each individual Tesco store and see if they have my keys????  A person could hand them in to a store in a  totally different part of the country from where they were found and I would have no way of getting them back. You should absolutely have a central logging system and after a set time  hand to the police who already have a system for contacting those who have registered lost keys.  Or you could get the tesco customers details from the clubcard so why can t you proactively contact the person informing them you have their keys?  I would now actively discourage anyone from having the clubcard key ring on their keys as it appears that it actually decreases your chances of getting lost keys back.  Very irresponsible of Tesco to so publicly offer a  key return service  that is completely unsatisfactory.  I would appreciate any help in working out if any of your Tesco stores happen to have had my keys handed in??;;;;;2016-06-20T15:45:12+0000;1466437512;2016-06-20 17:45:12;0;5;1;0;6;5;4;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0

One member of staff each time on that area and customer services.  Tonight I got so fed up I asked to see the manager. Took 20 minutes for one to finally appear  Sami  was given the usual excuses  lack of staff and people on breaks. No real apology or an offer to speak to a senior manager. Never even listened to my complaint  just repeated the same thing time and time again.   I felt really sorry for the lady on the lottery counter. Having to deal with phone calls  customers irate with waiting on both tills. She was nearly in tears.  Please get more staff  and please get managers who can apologise to customers properly and can provide staffing so customers don t get irate  doesn t look good for your customers seeing low paid staff stressed and struggling.;;;;;2016-06-18T19:17:15+0000;1466277435;2016-06-18 21:17:15;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We contacted the shop but was told that it hadn t been handed in as yet. As we were desperate to locate this cherished rabbit  I popped back into the store in the evening & spoke to very understanding lady at customer services who took my name & number & said she d have a look around the store for me. Later that evening I received a message to say that he d been found safe & well!!  My daughter & I went into the store this morning to collect him. We were handed a box with a note attached  saying that rabbit had been looked after over night & has been having a lovely time with his new friends. Inside the box was Jessica s very special rabbit with 3 plastic ducks inside!!  This thoughtful act has proved that a big organisation can still offer a personal touch!

The latest was Tesco s chicken in mushroom sauce with rice  which I had for a speedy lunch.  There may be an issue with too much salt in things  but enough salt to bring out the flavour would be good.  What s the point of producing dishes that don t taste right?  The good thing is that the salt pot is to hand to bring the taste up to edible.  It s ok for people whose palate is tuned to bland and tasteless food  sometimes for health reasons  and I suppose that it is better to leave it out for those people.  Then the rest of us who like tasty food can add salt.  A most notable exception is Quorn vegetarian cottage pie which Tesco also sell  and this has more body and taste than meaty ones.  Currently on offer until the 21st at £5 for three  if you fancy trying it.;;;;;2016-06-18T12:06:57+0000;1466251617;2016-06-18 14:06:57;2;3;2;0;5;3;2;1;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

My daughter opened her birthday gift of a new bike only to find it has two broken parts. I have pictures bit cant post them here. As this now put together  it does not fit in my car to take it to my local store. I do not want to return it but need one for my daughter that is not broken. What are my options please.

The first time I ever bought anything from any Tesco  was an online shop the other day. The delivery driver was really nice  and explained what the different colour bags was  substitutes etc seeing as It was my 1st delivery from you. Im surprised at the quality of the meat  as it was your own make  and some from the farm thingy :) My sons going on about the your cheap beans as if theyre heaven. I even got a call from the tesco that delivered asking if everything was ok. All in all  quite a good experience  and will be ordering again from you.

I was told that [quote] :  It s not my job . When I called the manager on the first occasion a week ago I was told that he would be  spoken to . Tonight  the same thing happened. I was told to take my bottle of alcohol to the customer services and again told by the security guard that  it was not his job and I could complain if I wanted to . Point1 : I had paid for my purchase so why should I have leave the self service till and take the bottle to be untagged at customer services myself? Previously  before this security guard was employed  all staff took the tagged bottle to customer services to be untagged then returned to the customer at the self-service till. Point 2 : I suspect the problem is that this security guard may be of the stricter islamic faith who strictly observes islamic teaching regarding alcohol. This is fine and I respect his point of view as we live in a free country where everyone is entitled to their political  religious and sexual freedoms. However : There are obviously two sides to this freedom. A customer is also free  in the UK  to buy alcohol. If a member of Tesco s staff feels that touching a bottle of alcohol is against his religion then I woud urge Tesco to redeploy this man in a position where he will not be at risk of contravening his beliefs  to which he is entitled. But I am also entitled  as a paying cutomer  not to be obliged to go out of my way to accommodate religious and cultural beliefs which are alien to me and to which I have a perfect right not to subscribe. In other words  I too have rights. Point 3 : This security guard  when I complained  told me that I could have gone to a manned till or to customer services with my purcheases. My reply : I am paying for my purchases and I will decide where to pay for my goods  not you. Point 4 : I urge Tesco management at Levenshulme to do two things : (1) Not to employ security guards at self-service tills  [especially as this is NOT their designated rôle]  but to instead employ members of staff trained to deal with customers. (2) Not to use staff with religious objections to handling alcohol in positions where they may be exposed to this. This letter of complaint is primarily addresed to Tesco Levenshulme management and I will await their feedback before I send this to Tesco CEO  Dave Lewis and before I publicise this matter further with Tesco Head Office. I think 4 days is sufficicent for a considered reply. Finally  I reiterate that I respect others beliefs but will not accept having to go out of my way to conform to religious sensitivities of those whose beliefs I do not share and are not part of the culture I was brought up in.

However when we go to Tesco Baldock my toddler is always excited to pick a piece of fruit and happily tucks in whilst I do the shopping.

While going around the store one member of staff tutted at her and rolled her eyes because she couldn t not get around the scooter. I also notice that one of the Internet shoppers was on their phone while working. At the check out the member of staff did not give a friendly welcome nor give eye contact throughout the transaction  the only time the member of staff did talk was to tell us the total  when it came to pay my nan wanted to pay by card instead of helping by passing the card reader down to my nan she just sat there and waited to the point I had to squeeze through and pass it to my nan.

The new one was ok but the battery was never fantastic. Over the months  it took longer to charge and when in use the battery went very quickly and then it wouldnt charge at all. I exchanged the charger and it worked for a while and then had the same issue as above and then resulting in it taking literally days to charge and when in use goes within 30 mins. I went to my local Tesco which is Oxford Retail Park today to get a full refund as it was purchased within a year and I have the receipt. At the customer services desk  they were happy to give me a refund  but the ref. no. on the receipt was not recignised on the system and she said she needed a no. to provide a redund. I telephoned customer services from instore and explained the issue  they said i had option to repair. I want a refund. Correct me if im wrong but an option is a choice  i want refund not repair as like i said i have reciept and was purchased within a year. Im disgusted that i was not given a refund  the item is faulty and I should be given one. The staff at the customer services desk and the manager in store was happy to do refund so want to know why one wasnt given.

I have settled after dinner and have now started eating  hazelnut and Belgian chocolate  cookies  only to find that they are sultana cookies. All this from one experience in Tesco. Definitely not a happy customer.;;;;;2016-06-16T20:13:35+0000;1466108015;2016-06-16 22:13:35;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was offered an exchange but unfortunately the magazine was out of stock. When the woman who was serving me went off to sort out a refund  my mum (who was waiting for me further down the store) overheard the woman talking to another Tesco worker about me returning the magazine and shaking her head and showing her the packaging  gesturing as if I was not telling the truth and had stolen the free gift! I wouldn t expect this from one of your workers  not at all happy :/;;;;;2016-06-16T19:58:34+0000;1466107114;2016-06-16 21:58:34;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

After a delayed flight of 2 hrs  we arrived home at 7.30 pm.   Plenty of time for our 8-9 delivery.  My son in law had been there since 6.30 painting  and was there to see us home.    Absolutely starving. We waited and waited.   I finally rang customer service and was told the driver was stuck in traffic.   Considering we had no problem getting from the airport  the time of night and the area we live  I thought this was ludicrous.     We waited another 20 minutes and rang again.    This time to be told by someone else that the driver tried to deliver early and phoned. Absolutely not.   We had no calls . He also said the driver couldn t find us.   We live on the main road!!   I obviously went nuts as that s two different stories and no shopping.   I was told they would rede liver at 11am next day.  I said as we had two disabled people that lived with us and what was u supposed to feed them with after such a long day until then .    I said if they could deliver between 8 and 9 I would accept the delivery but I wanted all the deli products to be re picked as they had been on the van all day.   I was told as they were bar coded that was impossible ! I told him not to bother I would get the shopping myself first thing which I did before 9 this morning.      Imagine our surprise when after 12 along comes the Tesco van with my order.   I chatted with the young man about what had happened and that he would have to take it away as I had all ready got what I needed.   He was rather embarrassed and produced a bunch of flowers which he had been told to give me by his manager.    A nice gesture But does not alter the fact  I had been let down.   Not only by the driver but by the two people I spoke to who both gave me different excuses.      Get your act together  if your going to tell your customers a load of codswallop .;;;;;2016-06-16T18:37:31+0000;1466102251;2016-06-16 20:37:31;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Delivery never showed up  no call  no message  nothing. Once I called  I was told the driver had returned to the depot for unknown reasons. I had to cancel the order  then re-order for the next day (Saturday morning  brilliant - NOT). For some reason they had to cancel my payment for the first order  then take another for the second  but it took 5 days for the money from the first order to be credited back to me. I was told I d get a call and an explanation as to what happened and why the delivery wasn t made. Guess what - never got a call. No call  no explanation  no apology for the inconvenience caused.  Send a message to the  contact us  page for customer service - silence. No answer.

T  he seam had let go of the bag  the member of staff then proceeded with ungloved hands to pick up the frozen food put it all back in the bag and putting back in the freezer and walked away  I stood at the freezer for over 10 minutes and had to tell a customer not to take that bag coz it had been all over the floor    I then wentblooking for the member of staff and on approaching her asked to speak to someone in management to inform them of what I had seen ie her dropping the food on the floor then picking it up and putting it back in the bag  the response was I am management and she walked off and totally ignored me.  So if Tesco management have no idea of health and hygiene or food handling protocol theres not much hope for the staff  so long story short keep your groceries Tesco I will never use your store again  I thought I would draw this to your attention to give you an opportunity to respond before voicing my concerns on all forums;;;;;2016-06-16T17:01:39+0000;1466096499;2016-06-16 19:01:39;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Arrow XL have just called me to advise that they are unable to deliver the item on Friday because they haven t received the stock from the supplier.

I have always left very good feedback regard the customer service i have received from your company on many occasions. However  on this occasion its not such good news.  I have been messed about  passed from pillar to post  spoken down to & literally lied to by representatives from Tesco for the past 3 weeks.  I have been trying to exchange my clubcard vouchers in my local store for nigh on 3 weeks now...... The machines are constantly out of order or require attention. Coincidently  this always seems to be the case around clubcard boost time...?!  hmm..... Customer services  for the most part  at my local store (Dudley) are no help whatsoever one member of staff is particularly rude and unhelpful & im hoping this will be dealt with in a separate complain direct to store.  I was referred to the telephone number specifically for clubcard on Monday (13/06/16) due to the fact the machines would for some unknown reason only print half of my entitlement...... this happened to a friend of mine too.... we were there over an hour trying to resolve the issue and after various attempts to get the machines up and running i was advised to accept the 50% vouchers and call regarding the rest. Upon calling clubcard  I spoke with a gentleman who  for all intents a purposes seemed to know what he was doing..... he dealt with my issue  said he d found the cause  apologised and promise to send out an email with my £50.00 remaining monies owed in the form of a gift card with £5.00 added for my troubles. This email  he said  would be valid for a year from the date of call.... He told me it could take upto 24 hours to receive. I waited........ I waited some more...... I called back ... i was told to give another 24 hours...... I did. Nothing. I called clubcard back on 15/06/16 and spoke with another gentleman who said first gentleman had done nothing..! Zilch!!... Not even any notes on the account  so i had to explain myself all over again....... 2nd gentleman then promised to emulate 1st gentleman s offer.... ok i said  benefit of the doubt i thought..... however  then the guy preceeded to inform me that it wouldnt be valid for 12m after all and would only be until the end of the boost promotion. So   26.06.16. Another 2 days (on top of the 2 weeks trying to print on the broken machines in store....) lost whereby i could have been shopping for goods.  As a result i asked to speak with management . A fella called Jason then came on the line  no surname as usual but a ref of: KI43 given. Again i had to repeat myself and state i wasnt happy with their offer as i felt i was losing out. Everyone else has been able to shop at their leisure  mine would be last minute panic buys at this rate.......  He told me that he would match the offer of £55.00 but it would still have to be used by 26.06.16 so in compensation for the misinformation given  i was offered a further £20.00 added to my clubcard account for future usage. He told me that the card would come  through the post  next day delivery with a receipt date promised for today 16/06/16. To stay home as it required a signature. Fine. after 45 mins on the telephone i obviously had things to do so i accepted and I seemed to be getting nowhere fast anyhow. Today  i waited..... waited... waited...... Post came. No card. Asked postman. No card. I rang clubcard again. i explained predicament again. Have now been informed that next day delivery means 2 days..?!?!?? As day 1 it only gets sent to the postroom and they have to be told exactly what next day delivery is..?!?!  hmm......? So  im then given the track & trace number to check royal mail myself... as if ive not got enough to do already..... I did. They arnt even in receipt of any such parcel/letter....!!!   I now have to take yet another day out of my schedule to wait in tomorrow  in the vain hope it may just arrive  like it was meant to arrive today.....??   As you can no doubt appreciate  im sceptical to say the least..!  I have lost valuble time in which to use these vouchers. MY entitlement as a very loyal customer. Nothing more  nothing less...... nothing for my troubles...... nothing for my time on the telephone........ which incidently amounts to almost 2 hours now..!!!! nothing for the constant brainumbingly repeating myself over and over... nothing for the incompetancy & training issues of your staff...?!!   Nothing for the lies of fella number 1 on Monday.......Futhermore  i have been informed by 2 different members of staff at clubcard that they could have done all this IN STORE a week ago........ but clearly they couldnt be bothered... & im not surprised in all honesty with the lady they have working on that department...!!   Tesco  i am appalled  disgusted and most of all disappointed in you........ but as i have already been told over and over and over again.......  theres nothing we can do.....    Well  im sorry i believe there is & i would very much like an apology  an explaination & some form of compensation.......  Ill await contact from yourselves in regards to this matter.

How about meal boxes like the burger boxes you get off burger vans? So someone has two or three different items they can go in the same box if they wish instead of two or three separate bags all sweating. A small mod to the table machine to list and sum up entire contents of box to one barcode for at the till (even sauce tubs). You d be able to do offers easier if you wanted to also.

I politely asked her if I could pick up a vanilla extract which was above her (didn t want to lean over her incase it dropped). She shot up and looked at me like I d spat in her face and huffed at me. She looked at me with such disgust.

I had a trampoline that was missing some parts and was trying to put it up ready for my sons birthday today  I called customer services and they sorted out the missing parts for me. By the time i got to the shop the parts were waiting along with a couple of water guns for my son and a very large bar of chocolate for me. The ladies help made this stressful situation so much easier and I am beyond grateful. My son loves his trampoline and was out at 6am testing it out.

Have to admit I was terrified!! Then the worst thing ever happened - I fell off and caught my foot in the stirrup and the horse was dragging me around in a circle. It wouldn t stop  it just kept going around and around.

I am disabled and use a mobility scooter and shopping is stressful enough without this kind of attitude.  He could hardly greet me did not offer any assistance and although he could see I was struggling to pack my shopping just keep shoving my items of shopping through.  It was irked when he en had to wait for me to find my club card and then even more when I had to ask him to pass me the machine.  Totally rude and unacceptable  but even more so because of my disability. I went to the customer services and asked to speak to checkout manager who was duly sent for. Just before she arrived someone was stopped on their way out and was then manhandled by approximately 6 store staff and security. When the checkout manager arrived she felt she was surely needed to assist this troublesome customer.  Quite what she was going to achieve I have no idea.  I was spoken to by a supervisor who duly apologised and said staff member would be spoken too.  However  I would say that because of the other commotion I felt my concerns were not quite so important!!!! I am not asking for any preferential treatment because of my disability but just common courtesy would have been good to see by all members of staff!!!!!;;;;;2016-06-15T19:58:29+0000;1466020709;2016-06-15 21:58:29;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

They are also prepared to help with other events and provisions within our school. Their generosity is amazing and we as a school are so grateful for the support they are showing us.

Those and the ginger nuts were the only  easily available  biscuits my son could eat. I didn t worry and assumed there was going to be a packaging change. How wrong was I. I noticed they were back on the shelves today and so checked the packaging. They now contain soya flour which means my son can no longer eat them.  I know a lot of families who recommended  and relied  on these biscuits being available and who now can t have them. There is no indication that these are a new recipe so unless you check every time someone could be made seriously ill.  Why change what isn t broken?!  It takes so long to find any decent  affordable and tasty food items when you re dealing with multiple allergies. The last thing we need is recipes changing and those simple items being taken away.  I usually commend tesco on their brilliant free from range but this has really annoyed and upset me.;;;;;2016-06-15T17:09:48+0000;1466010588;2016-06-15 19:09:48;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Your new (terrible - sorry  Ruth and that bloke have got to go) advert about taking back food you don t want anymore is worrying. Am I right in thinking that the bunch of bananas I pick up could have been sitting on the side of someone s manky kitchen covered in cat wee before I take them home? I noticed that  perishable foods must be returned before use by date  - but does this mean that a perishable food (meat  dairy  etc.) could have been taken home by someone  left on the side out of a fridge and then brought back for me to buy and then get ill from? If people can t commit to a bloody melon then maybe they need  assistance  with their shopping.

How is that promoting healthy eating???!!! Surely the deal needs to be across the board or not at all. Asda for example do 12 for £6 but for convenience being closer to home I still come to Tesco.

I spoke again with Louise the FFP Manageress . She says a certain number of Tesco stores are taking part in the Food Bank donations . The ones who are are applying the 70% as opposed to the 90% reduction off end of date fruit and veg and then donating what doesn t sell to Food Banks .  My point remains the same . If Tescos want to be seen to  donate to the food banks then they should do so in some other way which does not involve penalising the poor customers who shop in store . Expecting poor people to pay increased reduction price   say eg 54p for two partially rotten advocates is not good . It shouldnt have cost £1.80 for them in the 1st place . Louise and I both commented on how since the 20% increase in reduction price - the end of date FF produce is not selling and the poor customers have taken their minuscule  business to other stores which do the 90% reduction . I ve been told  that Food Banks are not allowed to distribute out of date foods ? As far as the the price war the poor are up against goes     I notice small tub of Lurpack margarine is £3.25 - or two for £4 . Really these prices are ridiculouse . We exist in a world where it has become acceptable and expected for supermarket prices to keep rising .  Whilst all supermarkets can donate to food banks is semi rotten fruit and veg that their poorest customers can no longer afford to buy because they have raised the final reduction price by 20% .

I visited Tesco Bursledon yesterday with a friend and my infant. As I was strapping my baby in the car  I saw a single male member of staff (wearing a green Tesco shirt and badge) pull in to the Parent and Child bay  get out and walk towards the store. So I say   Excuse me  you seem to have left your baby in the car!  To which he replied   Sorry what?  I said   Well you must have left your child in the car as you don t seem to have one with you.    He then proceeded to laugh at me and walked off so I followed him in and pointed him out to security. The very helpful lady on the customer service desk said she recognised him and would speak to his manager.   On numerous occasions I have witnessed single male and female customers pull up in their sports cars ecg  leaving me to walk across the massive carpark with a small baby and bags in the rain to find a trolly. Each time I have reported this to security and nothing is ever done about it. I would expect security to ask that they move to a regular parking bay but they don t; one time I was even instructed to take pictures and report it myself. This is unacceptable.  Not enough is being done to ensure these spaces are available for people who really need them. This also goes for disabled parking spaces  which I have also witnessed being misused. Tesco has failed me and countless other parents in allowing selfish  entitled people to do as they please. Would that member of staff have parked in a disabled bay to save himself a few extra steps?";;;;;2016-06-14T17:59:24+0000;1465927164;2016-06-14 19:59:24;0;13;0;0;13;13;7;6;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Twice now I have bought them and both lots have started to rot after only 4 days despite being taken out of the plastic bag they were sold in and put in a paper bag as soon as I got home.

I would just like to thank you for answering the age old question for me of  Which came first  the chicken or the egg?   Having just visited your Queensbury store and purchasing my usual order of Honey & Mustard Chicken pasta  a Scotch Egg and a drink  I am now absolutely clear on this! It is most definitely the egg as the chicken failed to turn up at all.   Upon opening my usually delicious pasta  I found with distain  that the chicken must have had a previous appointment  as there wasn t any there!   Maybe he was visiting relatives in Kiev or Kentucky  or even Henley on Thames but he definitely wasn t where he should have been  in my pasta. At least I could rely on good old dependable egg to hold the fort until the chicken decided to put in an appearance.   But this seemed a rather poultry substitute by comparison.   I have eaten my pasta  meatless  so I don t need a replacement. This also won t stop me seeking the elusive chicken in my next pasta but could you just inform him when he eventually turns up  that he needs to be a bit more reliable as he is killing the myth that he actually came first.;;;;;2016-06-14T13:11:48+0000;1465909908;2016-06-14 15:11:48;1;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;0

I write because I have lost all faith in your Tesco Direct service  and I am appalled that you seem happy to take my hard-earned money without actually delivering any goods  and in fact  without ever actually notifying me that said goods would not be turning up.  When our old dishwasher decided to bite the dust several weeks ago  we searched around for a replacement. Thinking we had found a good deal  we placed an order on Tesco Direct. Our money was taken and we received an email confirming our order  and advising that we would soon be able to confirm a delivery slot online. All fine so far. However with less than a week remaining until the date our email confirmed the dishwasher would be delivered by  we became concerned that we still could not specify a delivery date or time.  I duly called the number to enquire why this was  only to be told that the dishwasher we have ordered - and paid for in full - was STILL out of stock. Given that we had never once been informed that the product was out of stock  never mind this still being the case  it begs the question - how long are you planning to hang on to our money with no intention of fulfilling our order?  I look forward to your response.;;;;;2016-06-13T21:24:44+0000;1465853084;2016-06-13 23:24:44;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was a right pain to them this evening and they were great.  Firstly I filled up my car using the pay at pump system  but me being the idiot I am  took the nossle out of my car a bit to quickly  resulting in me spilling a small amount down the side of my car  and consequently  onto the tarmac. I cleaned up my car  and went into the building to inform one of your colleagues of the situtation. She had spotted my mishap and was already on her way out to put sand on the spilt petrol.  I then proceed to leave to petrol station  not realising I had left my purse ON THE ROOF OF MY CAR!! Oops. I didn t realise Until I had driven about half a mile and needed to use it. I immediently backtraced my route back to the station to see if anyone had handed in my purse. Unfortunately not  but kindly your colleagues assisted me to see if it had fallen off within the forecourt  -alas it had not. Your staff then proceed to check the CCTV to see if it was on my car when I had left the station. When they noticed it was  two of them assisted me up the road towards windhover roundabout  on foot  to try and look for it with me.   It was never found  but your staff did a fantastic job trying to help me find it. They definately went the extra mile today. I can remember their names unfortunately (maybe Lynn and Anne??) But they were super  and what made it even better is that  even though I had done two rather careless things  they didn t make me feel bad about it. They just kind reassured me that it happens more often than you would expect.  So yes  SUPER customer service this evening. Thank you.  PS if anyone finds a cream purse with cats on it  thats mine thanks  I don t want to pay for a new drivers  license!;;;;;2016-06-13T20:35:04+0000;1465850104;2016-06-13 22:35:04;2;4;2;0;6;4;3;1;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

My initial thought was  oh great timing. When in fact it was the best timing ever  one of the drivers loaded the truck while the other stated I cans see you have your hands full let me unpack the boxes onto your worktop while you dish up and sort out the kids! By the time I had finished sorting the squabble  the tea and the dogs she had it all unloaded!

She then turned to me and said should couldn t sell them if they don t scan! I asked for the manager and she also told me they couldn t sell them if they don t scan so I left without them and my other shopping.

Also have a very dissappointed 5 year old boy. I ordered a bed two weeks ago using some of my clubcard vouchers. Delivery was due tomorrow but just got a call saying bed out of stock and a refund had been processed. The bed is in stock to order online now!! Which is annoying. Is it in stock or not? Also I would have liked the option to just wait until it was in stock again rather than have my order cancelled and refund processed without asking me first. Now the refund has been done I can t have an alternative bed (for same price). Also why today (day before delivery) do we get told this? Not a week or two weeks ago? Do suppliers not know what stock they have in their warehouse?? (Not very useful for their insurers!) ! Expecting delivery today we have cleared out my sons room  totally redocarated it and bought other furniture which will work around the bed. We did all this at the weekend so knowing we were not going to receive the item sooner wpuld have been appreciated. We now have to re assemble my sons other bed from the garage where we had stored it just this morning. My son is also upset as he was very excited about the bed and the two weeks waiting for a 5 year old was bad enough  so get this news today is frustrating. Tesco have offered very little support in coming to a helpful solution. We have been told we will get the amount used in clubcard vouchers in a different card. That is fine but if I use them to order the bed again which is currently in stock online will I get the bed this time? The price of the bed has also gone up since I ordered it so now I will have to pay more for it too???  This is just ridiculous. Can someone tell me whether the bed exists or not and if I can order it?

After telling the gentleman my son knows the store so well he will be working there soon  and him asking which bit is his favourite  the fruit section  he went completely out of his way to get my son a banana and made him an official produce tester! ☺ Which he was thrilled with as we had run out so he didn t have one with his breakfast this morning! He was a truly lovely man who I think deserves some sort of recognition for his pleasant attitude. As I walked off to carry on shopping I could hear him talking to other customers. All round a very nice shopping trip! My son got his bananas  and I got my treats too 😊 Thankyou Andy or Alan in produce!;;;;;2016-06-13T13:32:04+0000;1465824724;2016-06-13 15:32:04;6;1;6;0;7;1;1;0;1;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;0

In this instance they chose to open the bag in the hall which had been packed to return to the store  and eat the label! cardboard  paper and foam rubber are their favourite things to eat. I took the trousers which had not been touched nor worn back to the store a couple of days later. Apparently they cannot be returned without the tag on  even though I had the receipt from a couple of days before. So how then does one return something that was say faulty  are we supposed to keep the tags on clothes that we wear?

Or think it s clever to call insulting names. To a diabetic having sugar free foods and drinks can be dangerous to your blood sugars.   Again Tesco I ask you why you you only do a couple of diabetic products.    People with diabetes do not manage their condition by cutting  sugary  foods out of their diet. If you have  diabetes  you can eat sugar-containing foods as part of your overall meal plan  as long as you account for the carbohydrate and calories in the food as part of your overall meal plan. Similarly  if you eat lots of so-called  sugar-free  foods  they may have replaced sucrose (sugar) with sweet tasting substances like sorbitol  mannitol  xylitol  isomalt  and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates. These are all  sugar alcohols   which are technically not  sugar  but are high in carbohydrate. Others may be sweetened with fructose  polydextrose  and maltodextrin  which also contain calories and carbohydrate. These foods will affect your blood glucose just as a sugar-containing food would  in proportion to the grams of carbohydrate in each serving of the food. In addition  foods containing these sugar alcohols can cause stomach discomfort and diarrhea if eaten in large quantities.  Other foods may be sweetened with aspartame or other non-caloric sweeteners like saccharin  acesulfame potassium  or sucralose. These sweeteners contain no carbohydrate. But again  you need to check the food label to see how many grams of carbohydrate are in each serving  because  sugar-free  does not mean  carbohydrate-free.  Some of the foods sweetened with non-caloric sweeteners (like aspartame-sweetened sodas) may indeed have no carbohydrate  and will have no effect on your blood glucose. Others  like an aspartame-sweetened yogurt  still contain carbohydrate (from the fruit or milk products in the yogurt) which must be calculated in your meal plan. These foods contain caloric sweeteners in combination with non-caloric sweeteners.  Work with your dietitian and healthcare team to learn how much of different types of foods you can eat at each meal and snack. Very likely your healthcare team will offer you the opportunity to use carbohydrate counting as a way to use meal planning to manage your blood glucose. In carbohydrate counting  you learn how many grams of carbohydrate you should aim for at each meal and snack. Then you read food labels and use carbohydrate gram counting food lists to figure out how you can  spend  the grams of carbohydrate allocated for a particular meal. You devise your meals based on how many grams of carbohydrate you can eat and how many grams of carbohydrate are in the various foods that comprise a given meal.;;;;;2016-06-12T17:14:08+0000;1465751648;2016-06-12 19:14:08;0;9;0;0;9;9;3;6;6;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My husband & I ordered a single bed for our daughter on Tesco.com making the use not only of tesco s final clubcard boost promotion but also taking advantage of an additional £20 off e voucher found online when purchasing the bed. After arranging our days off for the delivery of said bed  buying a mattress  duvet  pillows & bed sheets  our two year old was thoroughly excited about the prospect of receiving her  big girls bed . Much to our dismay  the day before the delivery  we received a phone call from Tesco stating that the bed was no longer in stock despite the fact that we had paid for it 10 days earlier & they had no idea when it would be back in stock. We were told we would receive a refund plus our doubled up vouchers back. 9 days on & after countless phone calls to customer care  we are still awaiting our refund as well as our doubled up vouchers never mind the £20 e coupon we have missed out on too. Tesco have said they could only refund the vouchers back to spend online which we have declined as we have lost confidence in the online service having not received our goods. We were told we would receive a store voucher so we could make use of the boost before it ends  within 5 working days but yet again with no avail.

Don t really know how to put this down  but while we was shopping my partner unexpectedly came on her heavy period not long after her miscarriage  she quickly acted and went to grab a packet of sanitary towels from the shelf and run down for the toilets  she politely asked at the  costumer service  desk if it s OK to pay for them after useing them because I was in the middle of the shop with the bank card and due to the distress of getting blood all over the place and the embarrassment coming out of this situation. The laidy at the costumer service desk said  that it is against our policies   my partner then burst craiyng and felt lost.  After she have found me in the store in tears in her eyes and paniking  I have run to the costumer service desk and first politely ask them why they didn t let her go to the toilet (especially when they are females them selfs) and got the same answare  at that point I have slightly lost my temper ( I like to publicly apologise for that  even after some yung boy wants to be security tald me that they just doing there job and that I have to leave the store and that I am not ever welcome back)  I have used my card to pay the  70p  for the sanitary towels and let my partner go to the toilet. The words of the yung boy that wants to be security but didn t had visibly shown his security badge asked me to leave the store and then followed me to the car park with words  that I can t ever come back to the store again .  I am pleased  to say that I will never go to that store again due to the disgusting way of being treated and especially haw my partner have been embarrassed in such a distressing situation.

So this returned food you accept back  does it get destroyed or does it get released back onto the shelves for general sale?  I would just express my concerns about reselling these products. For all you know the box of frozen fish I ve just bought could have been defrosted  opened  touched. For all you know the oranges I ve just bought could have been injected with something nasty or dipped in a chemical. For all you know the fresh chicken I have just bought was actually left out of refrigeration for 24 hours and in direct sunlight for 8 of those hours.   How do you know? And how are you going to rectify this when someone gets sick  someone s child gets sick  someone dies?   You might think I m being extreme so by all means try to explain to me the safety measures you have in place so this doesn t happen.   In the meantime I will not be shopping at Tesco like I have for the past 5 years and will encourage my friends and family to do the same!

Great slogan that when you have £43.21 in your account and good old tesco state spend less than £40 and Rob you of £4 OK I thought so spent £40.02 😆 £3 for delivery spot on. Then I get a phone call telling me there is an issue with payment!!! Only because you great spending conscious tesco peeps have yoinked a £3 BASKET CHARGE THAT WILL BE REFUNDED BUT I AM NOT GETTING THE GOODS I PURCHASED. So I called there customer services depth who told me  there is nothing I can do and the money has not actually left your account it s a reserve it goes into  so I said if the money is still in my account it would have not declined my transaction!!  The money is still in your account  was the reply so asked for a manager and he tried to tell me the same thing. Meanwhile back at the bat cave I have no shopping he then went on to explain it says in the terms and conditions and that when shopping online it is only a guide price!!!

However what happened today was absolutely unforgivable . I went through to your self checkout  and scanned and bagged all my items. I started to pack the bags underneath my buggy as I have a bit of a walk home. I had about 5 bags with me. Obviously this set off the  item removed from bagging area  alert. So I waited for a colleague to come over. When she did she said she wanted to see all my bags. I asked why as the screen only states item removed from bagging area and I was finished with packing anyway. She then accused me of having an unexpected item in my bags. I pointed out that the screen clearly states item removed from bagging area. I also pointed out that the guy next to me had a prompt like that and she didn t treat him the way she s treating me and she also didn t go through all his bags. She refused to listen and still demanded that she go through all my bags. She calls a colleague over and I am standing there as her and another lady are going through all my bags and making sure every single item is scanned (Mind you I had 5 bags full of items) Everyone is staring at me. At this point I lose my patience and tell them I refuse to stand there while they  treat me like I m thief and said I wanted to leave all my groceries and just take my babies food. And tell them they can cancel everything else off.  I grab the bag full of my babies food and go to another self check out  to scan it in again. And they are still standing there going through all those bags to make sure I didn t actually steal anything. I ve gone through your self checkout atleast 4-5 times a week and every time I ever got an alert like that the person always came over punched in their code and let me continue what I was doing.   I went to your customer service desk and spoke with  the deputy manager and of course she sided with her. Was not even interested in my side of it. She said she would speak to the colleague and walked away  I asked how she planned to do that when she never even asked me who the colleague was.   The only thing I can think of to as why your colleague treated me the way she did is maybe  she thinks I look dodgy because I am heavily tattooed which is just stupidity on her part.  I know  that me no longer spending £300-£400 a month in your store isn t exactly going to effect you financially  but there is no way I will ever step foot in your store again out of principle;;;;;2016-06-10T17:09:24+0000;1465578564;2016-06-10 19:09:24;1;10;1;0;11;10;7;3;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

When entering your store we were greeted by a sweet looking old lady offering samples of British Butter. My sister is Muslim and as its Ramadan she can not eat anything until later. I respect that so don t eat in front of her when we are out together. When we politely declined the offer of said butter the return comment from the lady was  oh  you don t like British then ...!  Now both my sister and myself are born and breed in England so the only thing that would make us different to everyone else that declined the offer would be my sisters headscarf. After a moment of shock we asked her why we wouldn t like British but got no reply. I am a nurse and have a lot of respect for the older generation but this comment was totally unacceptable. I asked to speak to the manager and along came Simon. We repeated the situation and he was fully supportive of our shock. He dealt with the issue immediately and asked the lady to leave. My sister often receives comments like this being a convert but I have never witnessed any company jump to her defence is such a remarkable way. He is a credit to your company and felt you needed to be made away. We left the store feeling respected and welcome.  Thank you Simon;;;;;2016-06-10T16:43:54+0000;1465577034;2016-06-10 18:43:54;4;8;5;1;14;8;8;0;0;0;4;1;0;0;0;0;0

When I asked why she explained that it is the law if bags are not being used for fresh products such as meat veg etc.  When I said that Morrisons do not charge for their small plastic bags the cashier explained it is because yours have handles.  I bumped into one of you managers on the way out and asked why do you bags have handles when other supermarkets don t and they do not charge.  He said that the cashier was wrong and that Morrison s were breaking the law!!!! I have since checked on the governments website and yes indeed all bags with handles are chargeable so this means that your cashier was correct on NOT your manager (who I suggest needs to be updated on this law!!) I strongly object to paying 5p for a minuscule plastic bag meant for wrapping not for carrying  and maybe Tesco should do the same as other supermarkets and NOT have handles on their wrapping bags and if this is not possible a sign warning people that they will be charged might be appropriate.  I would also like to know who pays for the bags that people leave in the trolly in the carpark and the ones flying about!! Also this is the first time since the law was changed that I have been asked to pay for a wrapping bag!!!  By the way I refused to pay so the cashier then had to throw away the bag which was now contaminated.;;;;;2016-06-10T14:06:40+0000;1465567600;2016-06-10 16:06:40;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have loved this daddy/son time but am now writing to inform you we will not be returning after today. I understand that menus are updated and change however today I was informed that instead of the usual egg/beans/sausage that my son usually has you now have a minimum of 5 items on a child s breakfast and I would be charged for 5 even if I didn t want them! I m not sure what your aim is? Do you intend to make extra profit on my time with you by charging for items I don t want? Do you intend for me to take the items I pay for and not eat them contributing to the growing food shortage that our planet is facing and adding to food waste when my 2 year old cannot eat a massive meal  or is it simply that tesco are supporting childhood obesity?? I would be very curious to hear your views on this!   Very disappointed   Tim Morphew;;;;;2016-06-10T08:43:40+0000;1465548220;2016-06-10 10:43:40;4;4;4;0;8;4;3;1;4;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

We went to use the lift in the store and when I pressed the lift button the doors opening and a youngish man was inside. The lift was already on the ground floor so he had just been standing inside. He said   I wouldnt go in that after what its just done . I took it with a pinch of salt - he seemed a bit strange and thought maybe the lift had jolted when it had reached the floor as they often do.My son and i went into the lift expecting the man to exit which he appeared to be doing  but he came back into the lift with us. He then pressed all the buttons not just the next floor button and the lift started to go up. A few seconds later the lift became stuck. I felt quite worried as he was behaving oddly. He then kept pressing all the lift buttons and banging on them and trying to open the lift doors. He wasnt panicking. He said he wanted to be an otis lift engineer and he could re-boot the lift. He seemed to me to be either autistic or he had been smoking something he was decidedly odd and I felt very threatened. I pressed the lift alarm button expecting it to keep ringing until someone answered. It did make a loud noise but no one seemed to be answering. I tried to call the store on my mobile but there was no signal. I may sound trivial but I was becoming quite worried and did feel threatened.  I then tried 999 as it seemed the only option and told them I was stuck and also that i felt threatened -- bit awkward when the threat is stood right next to you.  They put me through to the fire brigade and i explained etc and they were going to attend then at that point someone spoke on the intercom and we said we were stuck and they just said they would sort it and disappeared. To me this just left me with no communication with anybody. The fire brigade said oh you will be sorted and went off the line. After what seemed an age but was probably ten minutes the lift slowly moved back down and the doors opened and we left the lift. The odd guy stayed in the lift. I thought maybe somebody would be outside the lift but there was no one there. My son and I went to the security at the front of the shop to explain and tell bout the guy still messing in the lift. Nobody seemed aware in the shop that we had been stuck but apparently the pharmacy guy had eventually heard the alarm and told the manager but we were out by then.  Apparently the alarm contacts head office who control the lifts and they eventually contact someone in the store.  I was quite distressed traumatised and upset by it all.  I phoned my daughter to bring my husband to drive the car and me home as I felt a bit in shock by it all.  My husband spoke to the manager and he said they had never had anybody stuck in the lift before and had no precedures in place properly.  I could have had a heart attack in it and nobody would have been able to be contacted easily its crackers. You would think as well with terrorism and all sorts that there would be more safety procedures in place He ( manager) is looking into it to see about having the alarm ring directly to his office or somebodys office so they can deal with it quickly and look into the communication with the people in the lift while they are stuck I was more concerned about being stuck with a possible nutcase rather than the lift now actually working The guy was still messing about with the lift when we left the store;;;;;2016-06-10T08:08:03+0000;1465546083;2016-06-10 10:08:03;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

When you re giving back these clubcard points- for loyalty- for things such as hotels.. When you advise on your website that customers must call to enable them to use their vouchers  do you think you should enlighten customers that  in fact by calling  they ll have used their lovely loyalty rewards & would be best spending their vouchers elsewhere.  £10 for a simple phone call to book a room at Novotel! Yikes! When i asked Tesco on Twitter I was advised that they should tell me this- nada  & to go direct to the company. Novotel stated that it s my due to ask if the call was a costing call. Now  with all due respect tesco  we are a nation of unlimited calls. We dial & unless stated  we think it s free. We wouldn t specifically ask as  most  companies notify you at the beginning of this call. Or they expect it d be minimal cost given that it s coming from a company that expressed their value as  every little helps  meaning to save money! So  my question to you  Tesco is this;  Do you think it s right that you advertise this number for your loyal customers  only to be conned the other side of the phone call?! Your go!

Your staff were actively taking the food off the shelves.  When I mentioned this to one of your colleagues I got a very rude answer in reply. The point of a weekly food shop is to only have to go shopping once  this is important to me as I have a 3 month old baby who hates the shops. I had to get someone to watch him while I went.  I am most certainly not impressed as I don t understand why  when a store closes at midnight you find it necessary to take the most important part of a shopping list off the shelves at 7pm. What possible excuse is there for doing this?;;;;;2016-06-09T18:59:08+0000;1465498748;2016-06-09 20:59:08;0;4;0;0;4;4;3;1;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Picked my younger sister (16) up from home to go shopping for tea after work and part of my shop was alcohol! As we BOTH didn t have ID  I was refused the sale! I m 27 year old!!!! It is my consumers right to purchase alcohol if I am of age!!!!!  5 minutes later I returned with my mam and went to the customer service desk to complain but after a few ignored calls from management  I left. Meanwhile  my mam and younger sister had been to the till and purchased the alcohol despite them BOTH not having ID!  So basically  my understanding is that you would serve me if I was older OR if I had young children with me! Assuming I wasn t buying alcohol for my children!   That is discrimination and I am absolutely livid. I would like a valid explanation as to why this would happen! Not to mention the lack of help from management and me having to leave the store with no help at all on my issue!  I will not be shipping at tesco again!;;;;;2016-06-09T17:17:32+0000;1465492652;2016-06-09 19:17:32;0;13;0;0;13;12;3;9;15;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was very excited to be picking up the birthday presents I ordered from Tesco Direct ready to wrap for my daughter s 2nd birthday tomorrow. Her three older brothers were looking forward to helping me put her new slide together ready for the to play on in the morning.  I had an e mail saying that all the items had been dispatched and then an e mail saying 2 items had arrived  off I went to pick them up albeit a day later than they arrived at the store. I heard nothing about the third parcel which was the slide.  I got there to find Lewis who got together all my parcels minus the slide. I was about to call Tesco Direct to see where it was when he said he would call them on my behalf. The slide was missing somewhere thy couldn t tell me where but couldn t get one to me until tomorrow afternoon.  I think Lewis realised my disappointment and realised that it wouldn t be my little girl who would be upset  after all she will only be 2 tomorrow but the disappointment was mine  that I couldn t bring her downstairs tomorrow morning to see her shiny new slide. Lewis then handed me a gift to apologise on Tesco behalf  this gift was for me as Lewis s customer service is so excellent he realised I needed cheering up  not little Clara!   Lewis then carried my other packages to my car.  Thank you Lewis you are a credit to Tesco your service went above and beyond and you really cheered me up.;;;;;2016-06-09T17:14:47+0000;1465492487;2016-06-09 19:14:47;14;6;14;0;20;5;4;1;2;0;14;0;0;0;0;0;0

When I arrived the staff knew nothing off this even though press releases were out to say they were starting in this Tesco today. They looked into it and said they would be in tomorrow morning. Complete let down. Now  the Tesco is almost sold out of all these glasses!

This morning i received some weekly coupons for £9 and £6 off  weekly shops of £60 . Now as a single pensioner i would not spend £60 on a weekly shop . Never mind about doing it for 3 weeks running . I feel that as a single person pensioner who i have to say does ALL my shopping at Tesco every week i am losing out for being a loyal customer  . Why could you not have done the coupons for £2 off a  £20 shop  for say 9 weeks then i would have been able to have my fair share for shopping EVERY week with you .;;;;;2016-06-09T12:34:25+0000;1465475665;2016-06-09 14:34:25;1;6;1;0;7;6;3;3;3;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

For instance you have coca cola vanilla on special offer buy two for two pound. Same red label coke bottle but with slightly different colour to the writing. Big yellow label promoting the aforementioned deal. Right next to regular coke which is part of the meal deal for 3 quid?  You do the same with the water and the crisps. It s ridiculous.  Separate everything in the meal deal to one section. Or use a different colour label to highlight items in the meal deal. This whole process stinks. It s quite clear that the whole purpose is to dupe already rushed people on their lunch into picking up something that they think is part of the meal deal picking up something that adds an additional quid to the total at the till. Which at busy times people in a rush are just going to accept. Stop your cowboy tactics tescos. No wonder people are choosing to shop elsewhere.  You have gone from the store that would do anything for their customers to make shopping better cheaper and a nicer experience into a mafia of retail intent on extracting every possible penny.

I had a BLT sandwich  opened the pack & took a bite. Glanced down to the other sandwich (still in the packet) & it had insects crawling round it. 🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜.  My son asked if they were still doing pancakes  to which she replied  no breakfast has finished but we have cottage pie... erm  not quite the same 😂?! So my son had sausage roll chips a beans. I looked at the receipt & we d been charged for a large chips  there was no more than 10 on the plate. Beans were all congealed & the sausage roll was mush inside.  The worst of it was when I took the sandwich back the staff told me they came pre packed & it s not the first time someone has returned it with insets in 😱🙈 🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜;;;;;2016-06-09T12:11:33+0000;1465474293;2016-06-09 14:11:33;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

A few minutes later I receive a call from the Silverburn store to say my card had declined at 8am this morning.   Money was in my account after 8. I asked if this would delay my delivery. I was assured that my shopping had been picked was already in the van. They said even though my card declined they still aim to get shopping at time selected to you and they will alert the driver if no payment is made.   Error was 100% my part and Tesco still aim to deliver excellent efficient customer service. I m very happy with that. I m one to complain if I m unhappy only fair to praise when good customer service is had.

Last night I had a delivery shop booked for 9-10pm  it was the only slot I could do  as I was leaving the house at 7.30am  and not getting home til 9.15pm (my Mum was there babysitting from 8.30  so would be available to take in my delivery) AT 10.10pm  having heard nothing from you about the whereabouts of my delivery  I contacted your customer services  a lovely girl called Sophie called the store to get the drivers phone number  and attempted several times to contact the driver for me  with no luck!  At 10.40pm she called me back to let me know she d had no luck  and I was to assume my shop wasn t coming  but to wait up til 11 just in case (such great news for me when I d been up since 5am!!) She re-booked my shop to come today  but unfortunately the earliest that I can be here for it is 1-2pm slot  not a lot of use to me when the contents of my delivery included items that were needed for breakfast today  and for my sons packed lunch for school today!!!  And to top it all  she informed me that I would also be recharged for this amended delivery and then later refunded the original  not great when I m a single mum on a very tight budget  I have it  just  but it s going to leave me on a knife edge while I await the refund!  At no point in this did the store/driver ever contact me to warn me my delivery may be delayed/not arrive  and no one has bothered to apologise for the significant inconvenience of a) being charged twice  b) waiting up that late when I ve been up working all day  and c) will now have to be at home this afternoon waiting again  when I d had plans I ve now had to cancel  as I need the shopping  or there will be no dinner tonight!!  So thanks Tesco  thanks for that whole bunch of nothing I m now having for my breakfast!!;;;;;2016-06-09T06:38:30+0000;1465454310;2016-06-09 08:38:30;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Nothing! So at 9:10 I call your helpline and get told I will receive a call within 30 minutes...... Now at 9:49 nothing!

Well I am offended that you will stop calling them  Easter Eggs  as it is Easter and it has to do with Jesus and Easter is what the holiday is called for a reason and it is part of my religion as it is part of Christianity. So you feel it okay to offend the people of the UK who were born and bred in this country and who s forefathers fought for this country and have the religion of Christianity  yet you will not call  Easter Eggs  exactly that because you are afraid that it will offend other religions. This is an absoloute disgrace and I for one will certainly not be continuing to shop at your store. I am completely offended by this ad I am sure many others are. If we went to another country we would have to follow their way of life and respect their religion so why should other people of other religions not respect our way of life and our religion. Absolutely pathetic  you should keep calling them  Easter eggs  as that is exactly what they are as it is an Easter holiday for a reason.;;;;;2016-06-08T20:44:02+0000;1465418642;2016-06-08 22:44:02;2;13;2;0;15;13;8;5;35;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Due to coming out of hospital  I processed an online order last night as we had absolutely nothing in the house. As my partner works in Oxford  we live in the countryside and I m not even allowed to walk very far or drive  the online method of shopping should have been the most convenient option.   The order was due to arrive between 3-4 pm today and  at 4.30pm I decided to contact customer services as there was no sign. Customer services said that for some reason my order had been sent from Sunbury (120 miles away  as I live near Bristol) and they didn t no why. A local store provided a care package of essentials at 7.30pm however  could not provide full order as it was not reprocessed by customer services. Rang cust services again and they tried to reprocess it and it STILL attempted to deliver from the Sunbury store. Aaron then advised me to put the whole order in again from scratch  with no guarantee that it would link with my nearest store. I explained this would be extremely incovenient as I m currently unwell  especially without guarantee of successful delivery. Subsequently  I informed Aaron I d order my groceries through a competitor as there was no alternative that could be provided. I attempted to log this as a formal complaint with Aaron and requested details of the complaints procedure and was told that a response time couldn t be provided.   All I have been told today is that his has never happened before and it was an IT issue however  this doesn t solve my current situation of being without a grocery order  at the time I have requested  as I am unable to go to a shop. To be advised that the care package and a £10 e-credit is suffice compensation is ridiculous  when I am still without may items required for the remainder of the week. Additionally  as I can t process my online order through Tesco  and I will be using a competitor  the e-credit is worthless. I would like to know what Tesco are going to do about this almighty shambolic excuse for convenient shopping and customer service.;;;;;2016-06-08T18:45:01+0000;1465411501;2016-06-08 20:45:01;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Your usual template reply just isn t going to suffice this time I m afraid and as a (ex) loyal customer I m angry and disappointed at how we were approached by one of your security staff ordering my 15 year old son who suffers severely with anxiety  is on the autistic spectrum and recovering from agrophobia to remove his hood which he wears all the time to make him feel safe. He did not say  excuse me  we have a policy etc  he rudely said  hood.. take it down  motioning for my son who had a communication disorder to remove the only thing that allowed him comfortably to be stood in a busy supermarket  something that is a colossal challenge to him. Apparently no hoods are allowed to be worn in your stores because it prevents identification... except his face wasn t covered and he was needlessly embarrassed and distressed in public. However if he headwear on for religious or cultural reasons he wouldn t have been approached. How about personal or medical reasons? Elderly ladies in scarves? Hats? Where do you draw the line? I can understand helmets or bandanas but a boy shopping with his mum? I have provided all the details twice now and would really like to know what has been done to prevent further similar unnecessary treatment of your customers with mental health problems and suggest you review your unfair clothing policy. Where are the signs on the door? Also if you need to speak to someone  you should quietly take them aside. Just really disappointed with this and with being ignored.

I ve tried in vain to lure one through my letter box for many years now  I even tried bribing the postman with dog biscuits  I hear they like those. Alas  he wasn t privvy to the secrets of attaining the precious Tessco Clubcard.   I was strong willed at the beginning of this journey  but sadly I ve grown weak and bitter through lack of clubcard points  I almost rugby tackled a woman last Tuesday for rubbing it in my face that she was purchasing so much avacado and spinach for free using her points.   Goodness knows why one would spend precious clubcard points on nasty green tree eggs  doesn t she know what I d give for such points!?  My car is so desolate without the fuel top ups I ve been promising her for years  one day I keep telling her  I ll lavish you will all the petrol points.   In all seriousness Tesco - what s a gal gotta do for a clubcard? I ve signed up for one three times now and have never been sent a card. Think of all the tree eggs that I could have bought considering I shop there weekly. They think I don t want them. Well  I don t want them but we mustn t let them think that. Please Tesco  end my quest and send a clubcard through my door?

Firstly after being in the store for 5 minutes I got an announcement for my car registration to go to customer service. When I got there I had been told someone had come off their motorbike and ran into the back off my car in the torrential rain. As the rain was so bad I didn t want to take my baby out to check the car so the customer service ladies said they would keep an eye on him whilst I got the details. They were lovely.  Secondly as the rain was bad one of the gentlemen got me an umbrella (which he couldn t get under so got soaked) and came outside with me to check the car.  Then once I had actually done my shop the whole front of the store had flooded so they were letting people out the side exits. As my car was in the child space at the front entrance I had no choice but to go out this way. (This point the water was above my ankles). One of the ladies helped me get my shopping out to my car even though she herself had to step out and have water upto her ankles and still have to work with wet feet and pants. They also wrapped my baby in a towel so he kept dry and gave me one to put over my head.  As they didn t forsee what would happen in the torrential weather they acted very quick and were very patient with everyone. Although I am now sopping wet and home I would like to thank all the staff for there help!! 😊😊😊.;;;;;2016-06-08T14:55:19+0000;1465397719;2016-06-08 16:55:19;35;10;35;1;46;10;5;5;5;0;35;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am very impressed that he did this for me and have notified your customer services team by telephone so that he gets the recognition he deserves! :-D 🚐 👍 :-D;;;;;2016-06-08T14:38:06+0000;1465396686;2016-06-08 16:38:06;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

The current advertisement showing the range of returns now available has caused alarm bells to ring; as it shows a woman returning home after her shopping and deciding she would prefer a Pineapple rather the Watermelon. She goes back into store and does a swap!   Im sorry but i dont feel that any type of food should be returnable under  any  circumstance especially a change of mind once home. This is a violation of Health & Safety Concerns; considering the world we live in I dont trust anyone at all to take home a piece of fruit or other foods to be returned and possibly mishandled or worse injected with anything harmful or life threatening.   Yes some may argue  well we eat out or bring home takeaways; how can we trust them  in my defence at least I have the assurance that the person providing the food is known to me and I would trust this person/s more than some random could be psycho want to hurt people deliberately.   Well this has really made me reconsider shopping at Tesco s.   These are  my  concerns and obviously everyone else may have their own reservations which may be positive or in my case negative.";;;;;2016-06-08T14:35:55+0000;1465396555;2016-06-08 16:35:55;8;6;8;0;14;6;2;4;5;0;8;0;0;0;0;0;0

Colleagues have had no formal letters informing them how much money they will lose each month. There are people worrying about how they will survive and they have had no confirmation of exactly how much worse off they will be. There is talk that one to one meetings will commence after the 16th June? This is disgraceful these pay cuts are due to take place from July 3rd and colleagues have had no confirmation from Tesco about who is affected and how badly.  You have to ask   Are Tesco deliberately leaving it as late as possible because the losses are higher than they have indicated?Are they deliberately delaying so that there will be minimum bad publicity as a result of these pay cuts?  Come on Tesco at least show your long standing loyal workers a small bit of respect by giving them the vital information they need so they can make decisions about their future.

Those tablets you chew to show how dirty your teeth are. I wasn t bothered by brand  just needed the tablets  There are none on the dental aisle  so went to the pharmacy. The two members of staff were unsure what I was asking for initially  and then the pharmacist said she had never sold them before  and then laughed and said  Oh I m looking at them!  and retrieved a box from under the counter. She handed me them and asked if that was what I was after. It was! Yippee  I thought  at last we can buy them. For some reason the product wasn t priced  and I was asked to go and do my shopping whilst they located the details on the system. I had no shopping to do  but when faced with rows and rows of food  two children and it being evening  I was tired and easily worn down into purchasing items we really probably didn t need  apart from a bunch of bananas! After a long walk around  I returned to the pharmacy and was told that they couldn t locate the price on the system and so couldn t sell it  the product was being removed from sale and to return this afternoon or leave a telephone number IF i wanted to speak about it. Well  I have to admit I was annoyed  and more annoyed that if I had been told this straight away I may have had time for one final dash to another place which may have sold them. I needed the tablets for this morning. You made a bit of a healthy profit out of my shopping last night but you have one miffed customer who finds  it intriguing you have items in stock with no price. Also intrigued a pharmacist would not understand what I was asking for  I had to give a long description and in the midst of all that she walked away to serve another customer!  I do have a bunch of bananas though..........;;;;;2016-06-08T09:17:21+0000;1465377441;2016-06-08 11:17:21;0;3;0;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I appreciate that mistakes happen but we took holiday to wait for the fridge  it would be really appreciated if you would at least let us know before 11am that the delivery will not happen so I can get back to work.

My personal online shopping experience with Tesco has been overall very positive but I would like to be able to purchase things from the superstore  such as more American goods and Krispy Kreme products  through online shopping.   I have health problems that keep from shopping in person  so this would be an excellent improvement.   Also  I have disabled friends who love the customer service from Tesco. They have been massively impacted by your recent increase in the minimum spend which has caused them to stop using your service. Would you please consider lowering the minimum spend for people who are less-able to physically get to your shops and do a shop in person?

Apparently the factory that the stir-fries come from have no glass in the factory and in fact tried to say that must ve been glass in our wok when we cooked the stirfry. Seeing as the glass wasn t even that sharp you could tell it hadn t just been broken. So it was obvious it had to have come from the package even if we hadn t seen it ourselves. Then they try to say that apparently they ve had independent testing and there was no food present and Had never gone through any sort of cooking process. so one minute they re telling me it s glass from a jar of some sort of cooking sauce which we don t use and then they saying it had no food traces on it. Can t have it both ways. Manager then went on to offer me £25 on a gift card so if they don t feel guilty why would they do that? I just feel that as a big company like Tesco s there should be more concerned with the fact that a child and a piece of glass in their mouth!!!!;;;;;2016-06-07T18:19:38+0000;1465323578;2016-06-07 20:19:38;0;11;0;0;11;11;3;8;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I asked in store today when the promotion starts for Tennents with the GAWA N.I glass  to my shock and horror I was told they may not be running this promotion in Tesco s stores due to offending others. If this is true Tesco s I m deeply saddened that you have decided to take this line of action and cave into the Green and Orange debate in this country  we live in a society which is shared and the only way to move forward is acceptance. I would say if Ireland done the same glass for Republic Of Ireland it would surely go on sale also.  This is a way for Tenants to promote their beer through the Euros as you cant buy the glass online  which means the only way that the general public can purchase one is that they go to a bar. I don t want my post turned into a political debate as I would not offend anyone from a different culture but keep it in mind its not only consumers from one community that would like to get these glasses.   I will not name the store as I would not wish the member off staff to be disciplined over this but I m glad I asked the question as they were only telling the truth to customer.  At this I would like to wish both Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland all the best in the Euro s as I said acceptance - Moving forward.;;;;;2016-06-07T15:19:52+0000;1465312792;2016-06-07 17:19:52;18;15;18;5;38;15;7;8;7;0;18;0;0;0;0;0;0

Or am I just unlucky to live near Glastonbury?;;;;;2016-06-07T12:33:16+0000;1465302796;2016-06-07 14:33:16;2;5;2;0;7;5;2;3;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

My brother who has learning disabilities came in last night wanting to help my disabled mother purchase some cat litter  unfortunately he didn t see it had a rip in the bag  and when he bought it out to the car understandably my mother didn t want it in there! He took it back in and was told by the security guard to come back tomorrow because customer services was shut  despite the fact he had a receipt from 5 minutes before in his hand. My brother tried to explain why (which I shall explain further) this isn t an option  and the security guard responded with  well I have to get on a bus to get to work from Cowes  which is entirely ridiculous  irrelevant and rather rude ...My mum lives on the other side of the island and has very restricted mobility  and coming back the next day isn t an option  it s 8 miles away (in Cowes)  and she comes late at night to avoid the crowds. I find his response very interesting when your recent advert shows you will  exchange a watermelon for a pineapple  but apparently your security guard won t allow an exchange to a faulty bag of litter (which would make a mess over the car)  that s ripped open! Maybe you should add * in office hours only * and offer return petrol or fares  if an item is faulty outside of office hours. What do you think? (I ve since discovered that my mum was so tired  she actually gave him the money to buy a long life fabric bag to place it in rather than walk into the store to deal with it) I m willing to bet that had mum gone in  it would have been replaced.;;;;;2016-06-07T12:07:52+0000;1465301272;2016-06-07 14:07:52;0;2;0;1;3;2;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Just a couple of things though... the vegan sour cream - ewww. Compare it to Tofutti s Sour Supreme and you will understand what I mean. Also  vegans REALLY need more (and interesting) ready meals. A lot of your Indian and other world dishes might qualify but I m guessing the confusion between allergen and vegan is holding Tesco up? But there is a huge market for interesting meat-free food that doesn t rely on cheese  eggs and cream etc for its taste.

It was already easy to roll but this new improved stuff needs hardener to stay perfect on a cake as the new recipe rips and tears on cakes. I ve had quite a few experienced baker friends experience this as well as myself.

I automatically picked the petrol up but realised before I even put it anywhere near the car.  As I moved the nozzle to replace it and pick the right one up the readout suddenly jumped from £0.00 to £0.06! No fuel had been dispensed  not even by accident. I called the big guy out to the pump who said  it wasn t unusual and some times the pump read the trapped fumes ?!?   According to the station worker it  happens all the time ! I know it s only six pence but I think it s unacceptable. We pay enough for fuel already.   According to trading standards:  the internal volume of the hose can change due to internal pressure forcing more fuel into the hose. This effect is called ‘hose dilation’ and is simply the hose swelling slightly. The error in such cases  if any  is very minor and well inside the permitted pump error tolerances of -0.5% to +1.0% !  This was not within the permitted pump error tolerances and I hadn t even started to pump fuel.;;;;;2016-06-07T09:40:40+0000;1465292440;2016-06-07 11:40:40;1;3;1;0;4;3;2;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ve tried to shop with you twice in the last couple of weeks. The first time I walked in and there was a sign advising that customers could not purchase any items from the chillers. Ok  you have a problem. Frustrating  but fair enough.   Fast forward over a week later and I try to come and shop with you again. All the covers are on the chillers. I asked a lady who works for you if this was still an issue from the week before. She told me there was a problem with the gas  the chillers have been reaching 9 degrees and we could buy the food for the next 15 minutes  and they were being told to sell it  but she wouldn t buy it herself. She also told me the engineer had been this afternoon but had left without fixing anything. Honestly I found that quite shocking and worrying and left without anything from the chillers.  Please resolve this situation ASAP for the safety and wellbeing of all your Walsall customers.   Thank you.;;;;;2016-06-06T20:43:43+0000;1465245823;2016-06-06 22:43:43;2;4;2;0;6;4;2;2;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ordered some food and a personalised cake from your easy entertaining range for my son s Baptism.  When the delivery arrived the very nice delivery driver handed over my items then went back to the van to collect something.  She returned with a bag saying it was from the dot com team. When I opened the bag I found a lovely gift and handwritten card for my son signed from Robert and the dotcom team at Tesco Bathgate. I was so thankful that someone had the thought and had taken the effort to do such a kind thing. The team at Bathgate needs recognition for this kind act.;;;;;2016-06-06T20:31:46+0000;1465245106;2016-06-06 22:31:46;240;7;242;26;275;7;7;0;7;0;236;2;0;0;0;0;0

When the clubcards points recently came out for last month  I printed my £5 voucher using the machine instore and then using the machine again I scanned the £5 voucher to boost to a £10 voucher to use in store. I decided to keep it for another time and unfortunately I misplaced the voucher so it was unused. I wrote on here asking and I was told by a member of your social networking Facebook page that I would be able to go in store and easily have them print one out for me as obviously it was unused. I went into store and they said they would be unable to do this despite being told on here I could  and to ring up Clubcard. I rung them up and they said the same! So I am very disappointed to have been given conflicted advice and my £5 (£10 boost voucher) has literally gone to waste!;;;;;2016-06-06T19:48:57+0000;1465242537;2016-06-06 21:48:57;1;14;1;0;15;14;1;13;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Now just to set the scene  I walked to the branch about 15 minutes away  I am currently 8 and a half months pregnant with my 2 year old daughter  it is very hot outside and I had promised her all day that she could have an ice cream once we got to tesco if she was good all day.  So off we went  as she had been good all day. I am at the till with all my shopping and realise that after scanning everything I had left my purse at home. So my daughter that had clutched this ice cream the whole way around the shop  was now looking at me totally heart broken when I said she couldn t have it.  So she is now crying  I am literally on the verge of crying  when the customer service lady sees I am clearly struggling and offers to help me  I explain the situation. And she then crouches down to my very upset 2 year old and asks what s wrong  I explained about the ice cream to which she replies  well we can t have that  you come all this way and your not going to get your ice cream  you just wait here   She then produces a ice cream for my daughter and say  enjoy it    So now I am crying but with utter happiness and disbelief at what had just happened.  The cost to tesco was 50p the cost to me and my little girl is priceless. And I will Never forget.

We picked up a Click and Collect order yesterday and  apart from a little confusion with the guy there (which was sorted  maybe he was new?) everything was great with the order. My only complaint is that the melon we collected yesterday is completely bad. It s slightly mouldy on one end  has gone a funny colour and is sticky to touch. It almost looks like it was bad before it was frozen and it s defrosted yucky! I wasn t really planning on returning to the store over the next couple of days  and I don t really want to keep a rotting melon hanging around in the warm weather. Are you able to re-fund me without a return?;;;;;2016-06-06T05:04:48+0000;1465189488;2016-06-06 07:04:48;0;4;0;0;4;4;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We needed some pain relief for my daughter who had hurt her thumb.  Being on holiday we didn t know the layout of the store or where to go for medical treatment. A big thank you to one of your Employees Julie who was busy when we approached her for help in one of the aisles.  Not only did she stop her work & take us to the correct aisles  she chatted to my daughter to cheer her up & gave us full details of where to find the minor injuries unit near where we were staying. ..even offering to write down directions. She offered useful information on where to park  which part of the hospital to access etc which when you re away from home meant & unfamiliar with the hospital meant a lot.  What a lovely employee!

I went into the Launceston supermarket today (05/06/16) to stock up on groceries. I got to Martins checkout at about 3.55pm (just when the store was about to close) and realised I d lost my card - my only method of payment. I explained to Martin that I should go check for it in my car  so he held the shopping at the checkout. On my way to the car  I explained my situation to Giles (who I think was a store manager). Despite all of my panic  Giles made me feel human again  telling me about a recent time when he d lost his card and reassuring me it wasn t going to be an issue. He then told me the store would pay for my shopping  whilst we looked for the card. Not only did the store pay for my shopping  but Martin packed my shopping and even brought it to the door for me. After a quick search of the shop  Giles checked for my card at the customer services counter  which had already been closed for the day. It had been recorded that it had been handed in. I m so incredibly grateful for the finder of the cards honesty. The customer services worker  Ali  who was just about to go home  set down her bags and reopened the safe where it had been locked away.  Amongst all of this  what Giles  Martin  Ali  the finder of my card and tescos didn t know was that these groceries were going home to stock up the emptying cupboards of my Dad and I - My Dad has dementia and I am a student nurse on placement and in exam season. I cannot explain how much  these multiple acts of kindness have blessed and have helped us. You have completely changed my perspective of supermarkets. Dad and I are so overwhelmed and so grateful by all of the kindness shown and we ll think of you during our mealtimes this week!

My wife booked a lovely 1week stay self catering in Dorset.My wife spent a long time ordering our good n drink for the week online with tesco and was due to be delivered between 8-9 pm.We were in our accommodation from 5.30 onwards.After 8.30 had passed I thought I would phone and check  That that the driver could find us this is when i found out I had no phone or wi fi service. So walked off site till I could get a phone signal to phone customer helpline.I was told delivery had been attempted and failed  and returned to store .The man I spoke to said that they would attempt to redeliver on an Emergancy delivery slot and would come later I gave full instructions and waited till 10.45 before walking off site again to to phone again to be told that there would be no delivery and that it was not down at all to be delivered!!! She offered a morning delivery but I refused as I was so angry and disappointed  with Tesco. I had to ring again as I realised that pay ment had been taken and was told that this would take 3-5 working days ??? Due to this inferior service we have had no food for 13 hours and only water to drink.  We had ordered £172.18 worth of food and drink for our weeks stay and I m now sat outside MORRISONS with our 2 dogs while my wife is shopping when we should be relaxing enjoying the start of our holiday.  I don t believe enough effort was made to deliver our shop as there are places he could ve gone to for directions and our accomadation is easy to find and I gave directions when I phoned even giving our car description to make it easer Only to be told later there was never an intention to redeliver at all. One woman I spoke to gave me a £10 voucher which I find insulting after all this.  Had I been told it wasn t gonna be delivered I could have driven to Tesco to pick it up.  Also we have had to Pay out again for food do places and things we were gonna do we now can t because we have less money.  The whole experience has been upsetting and left us feeling angry and unimportant Tesco I feel did not offer or deliver good service for which I know they strive for.

As a parent with two children  that can be best described as the omen crossed with Dennis the menace. I find myself occasionally reliant on a nice glass of wine to relieve the stress of what is a constant ufc fight in my house.   So on Friday evening I popped in to your Bletchley store to pick up a bottle of my favourite wine (after long day and facing kids and wife in battle at home much needed). Picked up a few impulse bits and headed to the wine aisle. Being a regular I can pretty much traverse the aisle and pick up my wine with the same fluidity of an Olympic relay handover. As I reached the wines usual location stooped down. In readiness  reached to collect  to my horror the shelf was empty.   While normally this would not be an issue  as it s a nice wine and may just be sold out   on closer inspection it appears no!! MY brand is now discontinued 😯  it gets worse in selling off the stock the price was reduced to £2.75 a bottle 😲 (at no point was I informed of this) I am also at a loss as to who bought the remaining stock as before it was reduced I seemed to be only one purchasing and the shelves were normally full.   The story does not end there  I then in shock and reeling from this discovery realise I have to pick a new brand  I start looking (for reference my previous favourite was vineyards hill Merlot from Chile price £4 a bottle) I discover a new merlot  but wait there is a very similar name this time mountain vineyards (hmmm seems lot like my old fav) then I have a thought maybe I am saved and it s just a rebrand  hold on let me check price  £4.75.   I have to say the cynical side of me starts to think my good friends at Tesco could be tricking me into paying more for what is essentially the same product.  Using some basic mathematics I looked at my average purchasing and the new price and realised over a year this devious ploy will cost me around £100 a year more 😥.   You can obviously understand my disappointment and I am sure can sympathise with my plight now of having to try an parent without my favourite wine.;;;;;2016-06-04T10:52:57+0000;1465037577;2016-06-04 12:52:57;2;5;2;0;7;5;2;3;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I m sure we weren t the only customers grateful for this lovely touch. Thanks Tesco Northcott x;;;;;2016-06-03T21:02:58+0000;1464987778;2016-06-03 23:02:58;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We had just got a tiny 8 week old puppy for my disabled sister and needed to pick some things up for him so thought we d pop into my local Tesco for them.  Upon entering  I was holding the puppy in my arms and my sister next to me  the security guard gave me the filthiest look and insisted for health and hygiene reasons the puppy needed to wait outside  under normal circumstances I would ve accepted this however I explained my sister is disabled and epileptic (she has had several fits in this store previously) and can not be left alone so if the puppy waited outside that would mean either she s wondering tesco alone or she s stood outside alone. This is not acceptable she can not be alone. He proceeded to tell me it s  tough  and she would need to stay outside. I didn t continue to argue we just left the store and went to Asda instead who were more than helpful and understanding towards my situation. His attitude was a disgrace and he s let the store down big time today! That will be the last time I enter a Tesco store because clearly they do not have any understanding or compassion to the disabled.;;;;;2016-06-03T19:18:17+0000;1464981497;2016-06-03 21:18:17;2;14;2;0;16;14;4;10;15;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Under the sale of goods act it has to last a reasonable length of time - obviously 22 months for a 260 quid dishwasher is not a reasonable length of time.  However unfortunately James AAF0 and Anthony RJ59 in your call centre are not aware of the sale of goods act and just spout about a 12 months warranty after which it is the buyers problem.  I am sure that Tesco is aware of the sale of goods act and will of course honour its provisions without my having to go to the small claims court to have my rights upheld.  Please advise how I can get this issue resolved as quickly as possible because I currently have guests to stay and no dishwasher.

I bought the 540XL cartridge as it seemed the best value. Imagine how annoyed I was today to go to print a couple of invoices from a cartridge that has only printed about a dozen sheets in total to find the error message comes up saying the ink cartridge is EMPTY!! I have tried all the tips that the internet tells you to reset it but no - it DOESN T WORK! I am working away all weekend now so don t have the time to take it back into the shop.

I was very frustrated to find that this method of presentation has now been discontinued on your fresh fish counter and I was directed to pre-packaged salmon sides or portions. I am astounded that you have chosen to do this as salmon is very popular.  I have now been to another supermarket and purchased it there as I do not want pre-packaged  older and more expensive salmon. I have noticed recently you have discontinued/no longer stock a number of items I used to regularly buy..... To the point I can no longer do my entire weeks shop with Tescos  I have to do half elsewhere (Morrisons/Sainsburys/Lidl)  Another question.... Why are all your carrots currently from Israel?  They are the most watery and tasteless carrots I have ever had.... Even the rabbits won t touch them. I also wonder why you chose to source them from Israel when you actively promote and educate  Farm to Fork  to the local children in store.  I have seen these sessions and to the best of my knowledge at no point is importation on a jet or shipping container mentioned..... Just explanation about local farmers harvesting.  While I can appreciate some produce cannot be sourced from the UK  carrots are not one of them.  Please either buy British or stop mis-educating our children as to where their food is coming from.  Yours sincerely  Frustrated Tescos customer.;;;;;2016-06-03T11:42:10+0000;1464954130;2016-06-03 13:42:10;5;4;6;0;10;4;2;2;0;0;5;1;0;0;0;0;0

Unfortunately I had been in hospital all bank holiday weekend and discharged late Sunday evening. By Tuesday I  felt  up to getting a few bits in  as I was starting to go a little stir crazy. Any way  off I pop to your Uttoxeter store to gather by necessities. All went well  went to a self check out area  paid and left. Perfect! Or so I thought?! It turns out  I hadn t been my usual  with it  self. It came to yesterday lunch time  came to pay for something else and realised...well panicked...I had lost my debit card. First call was to the BF  no he didn t have it in his car. Second call to Tesco s customer service  explained my predicament and the lovely gentleman went away for a moment to check. Great news they had my card. Fantastic! All I needed to do was pop in with some photo ID and collect. Now all of this I would imagine is quite ordinary  but I wanted to say thank you and congratulate your staff on their fantastic customer service. From start to finish  they were polite  helpful and all round very understanding. The gentleman on the phone  the lady that greeted me at the store with a smile. It made the whole experience  that could of quite easily be a negative one  an un stressful smooth process from start to finish. And please please please  pass on my thanks to your staff at the store.;;;;;2016-06-03T09:26:07+0000;1464945967;2016-06-03 11:26:07;1;3;1;1;5;3;1;2;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Well  it all started when i was feeling rather peckish (long day in work  the usual deal) so i decided it was time for my daily trip to tesco to pick up a sandwich or a light snack to have on my way home. all was going well  the only difference being  this time i found myself in merthyr  so i went to the tesco there instead of the one in aberdare. after browsing through the selection (and there was a fair bit considering it was late into the evening  so good job on that) i decided to go for the chicken  tomato and basil pasta (a favorite of mine  that i only get sometimes because they dont stock it in aberdare  very strange)  anyway i make my purchase  and proceed home  thinking of the delightful taste of the pasta that will soon be in my mouth. but when i got home  disaster struck. i sat down  ready to enjoy the pasta in all its glory  and peel back the label covering for the plastic fork  only to find that the fork is absent!  i was now faced with a life changing decision  to leave the pasta  unopened  or to go and get a fork and add to dishes that i dont want to do  wasting valuable time and effort after a long day of mind crushing  soul eating work.  as im sure you can appreciate  this was a hard decision for me to make  and one that no decent human being would take lightly.   i am not writing for any sort of compensation or refund  i just ask that you ensure that this horrible occurrence is prevented  so that no other poor soul has to endure the pain and struggle that was set before me today.   thank you for your time in reading this.  kind regards  your pal  your buddy  your chum  your pasta loving mate  Ross.  p.s. i ll probably just get a fork.;;;;;2016-06-02T21:19:14+0000;1464902354;2016-06-02 23:19:14;0;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0

Order number Y9CHBPBG I ordered a silent night memory foam mattress last Friday night.  I paid for it using clubcard vouchers I have saved up for a long time.  The order said it would be delivered on Wednesday 1st June and an adult would have to sign for it.  My husband took the day off work yesterday to be here when it arrived.  He rang to ask where it was at about 12.45  he was told it was with yodel.  He rang again at 4.45 and was told someone would chase silent night and get back to him.  I rang approx 6 and was told it probably wouldn t be with us on June 1st but they would try and make sure it was delivered today.  I complained that the email told us it would be June 1st and my husband had taken a days holiday and that tesco should not offer this service if silent night cannot deliver.  Today at 11.30 I received an email to advise me my mattress would arrive tomorrow 3rd June.  During the afternoon I took the dog out and there was no one home  and I received a text from my neighbour to say the mattress had been delivered to them at approx 2.30. I arrived home  got the mattress only to find it was the wrong size  we had ordered king size and we now have a double mattress in our hall.  My husband called tesco at approx 6pm to be told silent night had gone home and he would be advised tomorrow afternoon on what would happen next.  I am very  very annoyed in 3 main areas 1. It did not arrive yesterday despite our order confirmation email telling us it would 2. It arrived today when no one was home despite an email advising us it would be here tomorrow 3. We do not have the product we ordered  Please advise by return how this situation will be resolved and what compensation you are going to give us for the inconvenience caused when all we wanted to do was buy a mattress and not have all this hassle.

This is an opportunity for the whole country to support the national team  to get together and enjoy a long overdue national spectacle. It is 30 years since this opporunity last occured  30 years in which the country is supposed to have reached a peace between the communities  30 years in which attitudes are supposed to have changed and 30 years in which we all should be able to celebrate our national football team s success.  I m therefore very disappointed and frustrated that a very small minority of haters and agitators have forced a large national company to remove items which could help all the people support the team in France. Many of these few protagonists chose to deliberately be offended in order to ferment a bigger row than it ever needs to be. By pandering to these few  instead of backing the many  you weaken your commercial position. I for one  will no longer shop at Tesco until this is resolved satisfactorily to the majority of decent citizens trying to support a fully inclusive national football team.;;;;;2016-06-02T17:43:53+0000;1464889433;2016-06-02 19:43:53;5;6;5;2;13;6;3;3;2;0;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

No notice to local residents of this starting and no signs posted. for a Car wash that when I read the planning proposal looked like the opposite side of the car park. Cheers I work permanent nights so I m going to really enjoy listening to the sounds of Pressure washers  Music and more People than normal every day of the week. Not like there isn t 3 other hand washes  within 2 miles either so not really sure of the need for this. Don t appreciate the snotty attitude of your managers either who just say its not their problem.   Great attitude to have toward those local to your stores on top of the parking problem created by your stff and customers who will not use your own Car Park ..;;;;;2016-06-02T17:07:44+0000;1464887264;2016-06-02 19:07:44;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have prescription toothpaste. The last time I took my prescription there they gave me an unknown brand instead of my usual known brand. I asked on this occasion that they make sure they give me the known brand. The woman behind the counter answered. You will have to get the dentist to write that on prescription because he has written the generic brand. I again specifically asked for the brand which I have always had. She answered the government won t pay us for that brand because it is far too expensive and if we were to give everyone that brand we would be out of business. My answer to her was  well in this case every little bit doesn t count . So much for your health care promise Tesco. Shocking! Anyhow I want you to know Boots the chemist gave me the known brand without question. I will never use Tesco pharmacy in Mold again.

The only reason i m not seriously injured or dead is because i came to an emergence stop on a main road.  Again i just thought i would let you know!

We have a fundraising day on Sunday and have just been let down by our supplier for burgers and cheese slices.   Would Tesco be able to help out with this charity event in supplying these (300 of each) either as a donation or a cheaper price?   All the money being raised is going towards building an indoor riding to allow all year access to riding facilities. This greatly helps for instance  children with autism keep their routine going all year.   Thanks for reading and hope to hear from you soon.

I went in looking for specific items which I couldn t find so I decided to ask a man who was walking past me. He replied I don t think we sell it and continued to walk off without even attempting to look or ask someone else. I then was already very unhappy so I hunted down another member of staff...hunted being the correct word as trying to find anyone to help in that store is like trying to find a openly gay man in Russia  it s virtually impossible. I did however find a girl speaking with four other colleagues near the till area so I approached them and waited  and waited whilst they glanced at me and carried on talking. Eventually once they had finished discussing their weight loss tips one girl said  you alrate there?  I proceeded to ask if tesco stocked a certain product and she glanced at me like I was a unicorn and said I have never seen one so probably not  then walked off.   Not only are the staff very very unhelpful  they really have no pride in what they do and they definitely don t care about your customers. I regularly shop at the tesco in alfreton where the staff are very friendly. Maybe a training course on how to be professional should take place soon.   Thanks for nothing really. Maybe you should change the motto of  every little helps  to  can anyone help!?    Thanks;;;;;2016-06-02T13:27:59+0000;1464874079;2016-06-02 15:27:59;16;6;19;3;28;6;3;3;3;0;16;1;0;2;0;0;0

Well I ve phoned your customer service team  but this was before I realised how outrageous the packaging on my order really were. 7 huge boxes to package 3x22l boxes (all separately with masses of paper padding  but some common sense was used and the bin was put in one of the crates)  1 laundry basket covered in bubble wrap  3 shoe boxes (all together finally) and 2xhopscotch number playmats (both in separate boxes and with excessive paper once again). And there was even a flat box WITHIN a box! I now have to find a way of storing all of this until the recycling is collected next week in my flat (thank goodness I am not limited with the amount of recycling I can put out). And I also need to find a way to bag it all up so it s actually taken by the refuse collectors.  This is the most wasteful  environmentally damaging and unfriendly practice I have ever come across. I will post the photos I managed to get as my toddler wasn t enjoying the lack of space and the inevitable mess is unbearable.   I have a feeling that you made a huge loss on my order. The cost of postage  packaging and staff costs would ve barely been covered by the almost £30 I spent. This has put me off ordering from you ever again and I will actively tell friends and family to avoid such unethical practices.;;;;;2016-06-02T12:41:46+0000;1464871306;2016-06-02 14:41:46;0;6;0;0;6;6;5;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I will not be buying anything else from Tesco direct as believe it or not I have better things to do than run around after delivery companies and sit around waiting for goods that should have been delivered yesterday.;;;;;2016-06-02T09:07:59+0000;1464858479;2016-06-02 11:07:59;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I called the hook store at 11:14 tues 30th to tell them what happened and advise them to put signs out. At the time I didn t realise my car was damaged!

We had a very long queue behind us as we struggled with our shopping which kept falling off the stand as there was no room. It was impossible to put our purchases through. We spend over £1000 a month in Tesco s but you have now lost a family of customers for good! Ridiculous situation. Staff would not help us but just shrugged and offered no assistance!

Ordered my groceries yesterday  set my new address  and yet it still defaulted to an address from around 5 years ago. Delivery driver rings  to let me know he s running late (actually a really nice guy) and I explain that it looks like it s going to the wrong place anyway. He tries to fit me in  but customer service / his store manager tell him he can t bring the food to me as it s not on the invoice and they can t generate another one. So they have to take my order back to their store  and I can re-order it. Go to re-order it  and no available slots for days.   Morrison s it is then. Just to clarify  paying customer wants food  driver wants to deliver food  Tesco customer services say  Nah  we ll take the food back  put it all back on shelves  and then you can wait three days and we ll pack it all back up again.

We ve not had any mailing about this. We save our points for Christmas vouchers  but I wanted to see if the points we had could be changed to vouchers now so we could use them in the boost.  Browsing on Tesco Direct I found a 10ft Plum trampoline for £89.98 included in the boost  so on Monday 30 May I rang in the morning. It was confirmed that I would be be able to have points transferred to vouchers. But they d need to speak to my husband as the card is in his name. Called again about 7pm and  with his consent  I was told the points would be issued as a money card email that I would receive in 24 hours.  It s now Wednesday 1 June  over 48 hours later  and I ve not had any email from Tesco. And now...The trampoline we wanted has reverted to £130. I ve just checked my points balance and its not changed. Indicating to me that no action has taken place to change out points to vouchers.  So my question is: As we were not informed of the final boost and because we did not receive the email in the specified time frame in order for us to use our vouchers to boost...Are you able to honour the price of the trampoline at £89.98 and let us use our vouchers in the boost on it?  Because at the moment I have promised our two little girls a trampoline  and I don t want to break their hearts because I cannot afford the price hike.

I m a set-in-my-ways shopper who regularly buys similar products and accepts the price they are in your store. I get irrationally angry when my regular products are unavailable because they re sold out when a special deal makes them a fraction of the regular price. Not only do I miss out on the deal  I miss my regular purchase. I m not naïve enough to believe you lose out through the price cuts  so suspect the supplier takes a hit in the interest of the promotion but as I (and I assume I m not alone in this) intend being on the planet another half century or so  buying similar products if I like them  living in the same house  shopping in the same shops (if you still exist)  can t you simply agree a fair price to your supplier  price reasonably to give your shareholders a fair profit while not forcing your customers away  but stop silly discounting and offers so the dull  every week visitor can rely on being able to make the purchases they enjoy? Butter has brought this request about. I am unable to enjoy my usual sandwiches because you ve none of my usual brand owing to a ridiculous price cut. Are dairy farmers suddenly so wealthy they can cut their prices? Is butter so ridiculously overpriced you can slash the price so? I ll wager not. I ll be buying it whether on special offer or not but can t when it s not even on the shelf. Unfortunately for you today  I didn t purchase an alternative since I simply traveled the 2 miles to one of your competitors where it wasn t on offer but was available. So how about fair pricing for a fair product for fairly looked-after suppliers?  I know this won t affect too many share dividend payments but  I m sure you ll agree  every little helps.;;;;;2016-06-01T19:42:26+0000;1464810146;2016-06-01 21:42:26;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I placed an order for a tablet and some accessories on friday night. I was quite surprised that despite offering  next day click and collect  my order would not be ready until the following wednesday - I do appreciate that it was after the 5pm cut off and a bank holiday but it wasn t even ready next working day (tuesday) and many big online retailers are still able to deliver next day click and collect on sundays and bank holidays so I was quite surprised tesco couldn t facilitate this.  Despite this I went with tesco because I believed I could rely on them to deliver my order on time.  Unfortunatly this was not the case. I received three different dispatch emails last night all stating my order would be ready to collect today. I received notification that  out of the 3 parcels had arrived but not the 3rd. I went online to track my order to find that the system coudlnt even tell me that yodel had received the parcell (Despite it being  dispatched ) and had no eta for the parcel. Confused I went into store - the staff were very helpful and rang up to chase the parcel but the response was less than satisfactory. I was told that they had to give yodel 48 hours to deliver the parcel - if this is the case why did the dispatch email sent 10pm last night still say it would arrive today?  I was also told that the reason it was dispatched by yodel is because it was coming from a different supplier. I found this particularly aggravating as I picked the tablet based on it being dispatched from tesco as I wanted to avoid the hassle that comes with buying from a third party seller - there was a much better tablet for the same price from a third party!  So here I am 5 days after placing my order with accessories and no tablet - I need to have it by tomorrow! I am awaiting a call from the store in the morning in the vague hope that it appears in the order but I don t have much faith if I am honest!;;;;;2016-06-01T18:23:41+0000;1464805421;2016-06-01 20:23:41;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was in one of your Belfast stores today enquiring about Northern Ireland deckchairs. As I m sure you re aware  Northern Ireland has qualified for the Euros in the summer of 2016. People have managed to get these chairs but when I enquired today they didn t really know what I was after and when I did get a member of staff they said they didn t get them.  Where can I get one of these chairs? According to a few friends Tesco in Carrickfergus and Coolstown have pulled them from their shelves and they are no longer on sale. Why? I m not sure. Maybe you could contact these stores to find out why.  I would like to support my country in the Euros just like England  Wales and ROI fans.   If you could point me in the right direction or find out where to get them it would be appreciated.   Thanks.;;;;;2016-06-01T16:50:28+0000;1464799828;2016-06-01 18:50:28;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Once checked out it is impossible to cancel an order! I have emptied the basket twice and tried to do it this way  but then the update button greys out  thus  not allowing you to update the empty basket.

The first time I was super impressed btw!  Anyway I had cause to change my delivery the  morning it was due as I had to go out that afternoon last minute  i phoned your customer services line that morning and asked if it was possible to change it to click and collect so I could pick it up instead  which I was told I could and given the time of 2pm. When I got to the click and collect at the time the customer services lady had given me I was met by a lovely customer assistant called Jo nokes  unfortunately there had been some mis communication somewhere along the line and she was unable to locate my shopping at the click and collect.  Anyway she was absolutely lovely and phoned through the the main store to try and establish what had happened (I took full responsibility as I had changed it last minute anyway) not even 10 minutes later Jo came back to me and said that if I was to go to customer services in the main store then my shopping would be there ready for me to collect :-) I was already very pleased with the service I had received... But it got better When I got to customer services the lady by the desk (I m sorry I don t know her name) called through to someone and a few minutes later the manager Ben (Maga/magor?) I can t read my own writing lol came out and seeing I was heavily pregnant not only took the shopping to my car  he also helped me bag it up and unpack it from the boxes into my boot! I think that both went over and beyond what they needed to do to help me especially as it was me changing the order last minute that had caused the confusion   they could have easily sent me away to await delivery like I had originally asked for. It is important to me that they are recognised for their good work as it is very rare that people s good work is acknowledged.  Thank you very much!

Said shopping didn t arrive  so a very hungry Andrew rang customer services to find out where it was .......  Apparently there had been some kind of mistake  which is fine  mistakes happen  so delivery was rearranged for today and he was offered a £6.00 discount  which is also fine.  What has made me REALLY mad is the fact that last night he rang me asking to borrow £150.00 - he s just been paid - apparently not only has he paid for his shopping but he has also somehow ended up paying for it AGAIN!  Andrew and Tamara are 21 and 20 respectively  Tam is a student and has no income  so they manage on Andrew s income. This has totally messed them up  they still have rent and living expenses to pay and they have no money left until Tesco repay their money.  Customer services have told them it will take 3 to 5 five working days for them to receive their repayment  they have been of little or no help  basically just fobbing them off with excuses and promised phone calls that don t happen and all they have offered in a measly £10 total discount - the poor kids spent more than that in the Co-Op last night getting cat food and something for dinner.;;;;;2016-06-01T13:45:56+0000;1464788756;2016-06-01 15:45:56;0;21;2;2;25;21;8;13;7;0;0;0;0;0;0;2;0

Then the nicest thing happens.... the cashier sees your struggling  sees your son is tired and bored and decides to distract your rioting 5 year old by getting him to  help  with the shopping.

I thought this was a great idea as not only as a family do we get through a lot of fruit and vegetables it was encouraging those on a budget to buy and eat more healthily.   My high school son  age 14  also chooses to buy his lunch from yourselves too. He has a budget and loved it that he could afford for part of his lunch a punnet of the imperfect fruit along with a pasta bowl. He prefers this to buying a meal deal including fruit as the packet there is smaller and he is a hungry growing boy  and on a budget.   After speaking to a member of the greencrocer staff i was not sure if anymore imperfect fruit would be coming in; and although fruit is sometimes discounted it is not until 2pm across the company as a whole. I feel maybe to help promote healthy eating particularly to those on a low budget and to those children/consumer wishing to choose a healthy filling option maybe more imperfect fruit and vegetables and the timings of reduced fruit and vegetables could be reviewed inline with lunchtimes? This would allow a healthier choice to be considered  purchased and consumed  particularly in our future generation.  Look forward to your feedback.  Kind regards";;;;;2016-06-01T08:31:57+0000;1464769917;2016-06-01 10:31:57;0;6;0;0;6;6;2;4;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

In my area  the Tesco Hardengreen store has been a great support to local food banks. The recent story about your Leith store needing to attach security devices to in continence pants made me wonder: would these be items stolen by career criminals or is it perhaps that some of the poorest in society are just desperately seeking some dignity? I of course can not claim to know the answer for sure  but wonder if it might be possible for you (or Tena) to use some of your corporate social responsibility budget to donate some of these pants to local health clinics  food banks or other relevant community groups? Or even to encourage customers to donate such items for food banks (I for one would be happy to donate to such a drive)? I know there have been similar collections of nappies etc. I may be wrong and only your experts will see the difference  but it may significantly reduce the need to buy the expensive security tags to protect future stocks? There will be someone better qualified than I to advise  but just thought I would put the suggestion out there.;;;;;2016-06-01T08:16:16+0000;1464768976;2016-06-01 10:16:16;2;3;2;0;5;3;1;2;2;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0
