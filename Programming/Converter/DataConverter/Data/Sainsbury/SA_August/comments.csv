Our Own brand CD-Rs were discontinued as the recordable media market is in significant decline and therefore our sales are decreasing in line with this. Based on the market decline it was rationalised that the space could be utilised for products which are in growing markets.  Please also note that we range a Sony CD-R 25pack or 50pack which are competitive on price within the marketplace. Hope this helps! Sam.;2016-09-01T10:12:12+0000;0

Let me paint the picture.....  Imagine if you will that you are a 30 year old woman (that s me  by the way) recently heartbroken  on her way to spend the afternoon with your very pregnant bestie. You have told her you are going to take round some tasty treats and soul food....and for the purposes of clarity  by soul food  what I actually mean is cake.   You stop off at your local Sainsbury s store (Barnwood in Gloucester) on the hunt for nomaliscious squidgy  sweet  chocolately  cakey deliciousness and make a beeline for the patisserie counter.   Now  as I m sure you are fully immersed in your current role (female  30  heartbroken craving cake  delivering to very pregnant friend) I m sure I don t need to tell you the importance of making the right decision at the patisserie counter.  Everything rests on this. The wrong cake and the afternoon could descend into a hormonal blub fest. You re also more than a little bit skint  so splurging on fancy cakes is a HUGE treat.   You choose a couple of safe bets: jam doughnut  cream eclair... But then.... your eyes alight on a thing of beauty! The label describes it as a millionaires tart. You lick your lips  thinking of a dense chocolate ganache on top of a smooth caramel  encased in crisp buttery pastry case. It is the last one left  it s as if it was meant for you!   You race to your friend s house (at a responsible speed  in line with the rules and regulations of the Highway Code)  barely able to contain your excitement. In her kitchen  you cut the tart into shareable portions  salivating as the hidden caramel oozes out...your friend looks over your shoulder and exclaims  WHAT is that?! It looks AMAZING  I can t wait to try it!   On the sofa  binge watching Say Yes To The Dress with the plate of cakes between you  you save the best til last- opting for eclair and doughnut first - you are the first to try the tart  you lick a little bit of the caramel from your finger ...so so  and take a big bite into the chocolatey filling aaaaand:   IT S DISGUSTING.   No  really. It s a big giant let down...just like every man... (Whoops  not integral to the story...moving on)   You look at your friend with eyes filled with disappointment and sadness. She also takes a bite.   BFF: ugh! *pulls tart away from mouth  then begins to do a visual inspection*  You: I know! Why is it so sweet?  BFF: it s like biting into a big gloop of icing sugar. You: *pulling a face* why isn t it ganache? Shouldn t it be ganache?  BFF: it SHOULD be ganache  You: do you think they just ran out in the bakery and decided to make do with the chocolate fondant they use for the eclairs?! BFF: that s EXACTLY what it tastes like.  You: Sainsbury s has let us down.   So there you have it. A tale of disappointment and woe. I hope this immersive experience has helped you to truly understand the extent to which poor product quality can impact upon a person s day. If you re going to have a  patisserie  counter  at least stock it with proper stuff  otherwise we might as well just go to Greggs.... even the NOTION! 😱  With great sadness  Emily-Rose (the heartbroken one) and Bethan (the pregnant one);2016-08-31T09:58:29+0000;10155167051079377_10155175381984377;52f1e4ee311df984b0877b8729981cbe516c7f16;1;How about the fact that there are actual real life people reading these complaints, and it makes their day an awful lot more enjoyable if they get a pleasant, non-aggressive message, rather than - in the case of one I've just read- someone calling them pr**ks because of an out of date sandwich?;2016-09-02T14:33:49+0000;2

Sizes not available in the two stores I visited on the first day of offer. So home to order online. Went into store to collect. Once I got out to the car I opened pack and realised id ordered black tracksuit bottoms instead of blue. So went in to exchange. Walked back through store twice to check both areas where the uniform is kept. No blue bottoms. So went to customer service desk. Explained to lady on desk and asked if she possibly had any more out the back (I have recieved good service previously when asking staff to check out back). Her response was  i have no idea ! She then told me that I needed to walk back through the store (5th time in my visit) to find another member of staff to ask them. I did and managed to get them from stock room. Went back to desk to exchange. Straight forward or so I thought. No she informed me I would need to return first pair. Then buy second pair. And I wouldn t be refunded immediately as it was an online purchase. I told her I didn t understand and that I just wanted a straight swap just black to blue. She said it can t be done. (I d like to say that if I didn t have my receipt she wouldn t have even known that it wasn t purchased in store ) she was unable to explain why I couldn t just swap and why I had to pay again. Just kept saying thats the way its always been. Since shes worked there a year.Very bad attitude also was abrupt and short with me. At last she asked if I wanted a printed receipt or just to wait for an email. I said yes I d like a reciept please and she said of course you can no problem. But by the tone of her voice it obviously was a problem. I left the store very frustrated and quite angry.

If you order something online, then it has to be returned through the online process rather than through the store for stock reasons, so this is why you wouldn't be able to exchange the item.

Yes  I had removed the tags prior to going to iron them  which had me notice they were girls school trousers and not boys. When I purchased them they were among the boys clothing at the store  therefore had clearly been mixed up and I just grabbed the age required. I still had the tags and know items are sold without the tags as they put a code in instead  so then they told me if they took these trousers back then their store would lose money as these particular trousers are not sold in their store (now I don t mean to be rude  but that is ridiculous  there are numerous stores around the country with people exchanging/refunding)! So the fact they had no tags on them  but were there and that this store didn t sell these trousers meant I wasn t eligible for an exchange. Well like I said to them I will go and get the tags put back on and then instead of exchanging I will go to a different store that I ve never had a problem with exchanges or refunds in the past.  I have 3 boys  so definitely did not require girls school trousers and had purchased all their uniform in your store  but to exchange one set of trousers was a little too much. I even had PE shoes on hand to pay for too  safe to say I decided against buying them and will head to another shop instead.  You ll have the trousers back soon  once the tag is bag on.

When you buy a single or double spirit, this is again from the same container bought at wholesale. Ask for the bottle (the whole container) and you're likely to get it cheaper.   Back in my livelier days, clubs would often give you the option to book a VIP room with a bottle cheaper than buying it in nips. Even now, in most of the pubs I drink in, it's cheaper to buy a bottle of wine than it is to buy three 25cl glasses.  Maybe it's time you started buying petrol by the tanker?;2016-08-29T19:20:19+0000;4

If a litre of sprit costs £30 then the 70 cl bottle should cost the appropriate price. Indeed, some people ain't half stupid. But the stupid ones are those who accept the status quo.

So in all those numbers you're suggesting none of them buy their Xantham gum from Sainsburys to do their home baking? (If you have ever tried to make a gluten free cake or bread you would understand the need for Xantham gum). I just struggle to comprehend it! Perhaps they are all buying it at Tesco like I had to....along with their herbs and spices.;2016-08-29T17:18:08+0000;0

You are losing sales...I was not the only customer who wanted bread.;2016-08-28T21:06:13+0000;10155157389434377_10155159450574377;9b3801a540b14a1835a966bd82b9e29eba7542c7;0;All the bread I would have chosen was already in the bin. I finished my shopping and bought bread elsewhere. I shouldn't have to make anyone aware I want to purchase bread. The bread that was made for customers to buy should be left on sale until the store closes. The bakery staff obviously want to finish earlier.;2016-08-29T11:16:54+0000;0

Upon checking my reciept when I got to work I noticed that I must have made an error at the self service checkout and not properly keyed in that I used one bag. Anyways  this has been on my mind ever since. I can t sleep at night. I can t go within a mile of the store because I feel like you have a CCTV image of me in the staff room and the police on standby. Point is  I am no thief and would like to rectify my mistake. So basically  can I send you a cheque for 5p plus any interest you may have lost out on as a result of my 5p not being added into your takings for that day? Thanks.;2016-08-28T16:46:08+0000;10155156584109377_10155156606189377;pageowner;0;So it was you! We were wondering were that extra bag had gone. Fair enough, you got in contact and told us so we'll call off the police search and let you keep the bag! We'll also take down the Most Wanted poster in the store. Thanks.

They said they hadn't had any swimwear stock in for weeks, as management felt that swimming was only a seasonal event down here. Cornwall produces swimmers, sailors and triathletes all year round, and Penzance has a great leisure centre, so I can't believe they think it's only tourists who matter. Especially after the Olympic Games.;2016-08-28T12:55:34+0000;0

The first email back basically blamed us for our original card being rejected and did not address that we called up, gave another card and were told that it was all fine. I emailed back to this to ask for them to reread the original email and the response again was very off hand that they apologised that we felt that they hadn't read the message properly and would pass on a message to a manager.

Saturday 27th August I was looking forward to a hot pizza  freshly made in store. When I arrived and asked about gluten free options I was told its not possible to make a gf pizza but gf pizza bases were available on the shop floor.  My family had previously enjoyed pizzas from your Weymouth store as they do not have a wheat intolerance. I would have liked to have the convenience of a hot pizza made especially for my dietary needs as anyone who is vegan or vegetarian would.  I do not chose to eat a wheat free diet and feel penalized by the lack of tasty food to chose from. This is why I ask you to become the first supermarket to make gf bespoke pizzas as you normally would. I realise cross contamination I an issue but if major pizzerias are able to fulfill an exciting menu for gf then why not Sainsbury s? GF and wheat avoidance is a huge problem and big market. This is evident in trying to purchase bread and the shelves are empty from sales. I look forward to your thoughts and possibilities about taking this forward.;2016-08-27T20:11:58+0000;10155153845944377_10155155514409377;pageowner;0;Good Morning Jacueline.  I am sorry you are unhappy about the lack of gluten free options on our pizza counters.  Gluten free products and items suitable for coeliacs need to be made under the strictest of conditions with no risk of cross contamination.  As this is a pizza counter is full of flour and other ingredients that could cause risk, we would not be permitted to say that anything produced there would be 100% gluten free or indeed suitable for those suffering from allergies. I hope this answers your questions.  Thanks Cheryl;2016-08-28T09:16:40+0000;1

All I wanted was the convenience that everyone else has and that in part was offered by morrisons. So sorry, gf failure Sainsbury's. As for shelves being empty and not being re stocked or re ordered, I have witnessed the amount of people buying the bread in other stores and there is a lot more choice in all other stores and that's why at least 4 shelves of gf bread are empty. I have first hand knowledge of this. The growing demand for alternative to wheat  for health, as me, or lifestyle reasons is vast. Sainsburys is obviously not the place to shop in future for me.

We'd have appreciated a bit more honesty from customer services who claimed the driver was 'running late'. Not an altogether great experience for our first 'on line' shop.

Made the order on the 19th to take advantage of the 25% off, Paid extra for the delivery to come yesterday 26th got email to say all was ok stayed in all day waiting no delivery. Mine too was all uniform in fact everthing my 2 boys needed for school now my boys have no new uniform at all we're away all next wk and they start back on the 6th! They have cancelled my order I have a full refund coming  which takes 3-5 days (although it takes 2 minutes to take it out) i do have a giftcard coming with the discount amount on it but in the mean time I have to drag 2 boys and a 9 wk old round the shops for it all  Total inconvenience and a waste of my time.  Hope you get sorted. x;2016-08-27T13:07:01+0000;0

Second this means I was told I did not get the 25% discount on purchases of 6.  Third when I asked the driver if I'd paid full price for the prosecco he pointed out the price on the invoice £22.50 and the balance due £54.50 and said this was as I hadn't taken alternatives and therefore not received 6 not that the discount was taken out afterwards on the invoice, so I returned them  Finally this means I paid £5 delivery I have no prosecco and have actually only a handful of items I could have walked  over the road to buy.  On the positive your driver was punctual and courteous.  YOUR RESPONSE:  Thanks for getting in touch with us.  I’m disappointed you missed out on our 25% off promotion on selected wine and champagne due to availability. I’m sure you were looking forward to these savings. I’m sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you.  As the shopping is delivered from one of our stores and not a warehouse, there may be occasions when items are unavailable on the day of delivery. This is the case as if you were shopping instore and the item is sold out. We do always try and make sure there's enough stock available and sometimes, due to increased demand, certain products may sell out quicker than anticipated.  I’d like to reassure you that our buyers liaise with all store managers. This helps them to understand what our customers are buying and makes sure our stock reflects local needs.    As you’ve returned items with the driver, please allow 3 to 5 working days for this amount to return to your account.  We appreciate the time you’ve taken to contact us and we hope to see you online again soon  MY RESPONSE TO YOUR REPLY   I must say I found the response even more disappointing than the service!  There is only one reason for my order the discount!!  A/ There may be occasions when items are unavailable on the day of delivery. This is the case as if you were shopping in store and the item is sold out.   If I was shopping in store I would know there was no stock and not go ahead with paying £5 to have the whole reason for my order delivered.  B/ I’d like to reassure you that our buyers liaise with all store managers. This helps them to understand what our customers are buying and makes sure our stock reflects local needs.  Here they obviously failed miserably as you had a promotion and not enough stock, this has lead to my disappointment and dissatisfaction. which I can assure you is not placated by platitudes.  THE SAGA CONTINUES  SAINSBURY'S:  Thanks for replying to my colleague’s email.  I’m sorry that you’re unhappy with our response and I appreciate it’s frustrating as you haven’t been able to take advantage of the promotion on this occasion.  We deliver orders with the understanding that our customers’ are aware of all of our policies, including the availability of our products. Special offers and promotions are also subject to availability as in this instance where 6 bottles were required for the offer to apply, but only 3 were in stock unfortunately.  As we’ve still delivered the order with what was available in line with our policies and you’ve been happy to accept part of the order, the £5 delivery charge still stands. However, if the whole order was returned we would have processed a full refund which would include the delivery charge.  We pass on feedback from all of our customers to the online manager of the store. This helps us see what areas require particular attention and the online manager will take the feedback on board and address the matters with the appropriate action.  I realise this may not be the response you were hoping for and I appreciate that you may not have been aware about all of our policies, but I hope you can understand our position with this.  We appreciate the time you’ve taken to contact Sainsbury’s and hope to see you online soon  MY FINAL RESPONSE:  At the end of the day it's only £5 and I am not going to loose any sleep. While I'm sure you feel you're making some point at my expense and I'm sure that it's of little consequence to you, but it will be the last £5 that I spend with Sainsbury's.  The online experience has been dreadful. the only reason I had a delivery was the offer and I'm sure that in your small print you have a clause that covers your statement but as you said I hope you can understand how I feel I've been poorly treated by you hiding behind your discreetly placed statement of policy, as apposed to your bold headline offer.  However on one point I take great exception with your email, you were not privy to my discussion with your driver and so your arrogant statement that... ""you’ve been happy to accept part of the order"" believe me I have been far from happy with the whole experience.";2016-08-27T21:55:33+0000;0

Unfortunately our scanners don’t work with Nectar cards in this format so customers are not able to use these in stores. Points can only be collected by scanning or swiping the actual card. Our colleagues aren't able to handle a customers phone, or attempt to type in the Nectar card number from the phone into the till. Customers need to present their actual card or have their receipt validated to add the points the next time they're in store. Chris.;2016-08-26T08:57:42+0000;0

I don't understand either. You would think that they would want the Taste the Difference brand to represent quality. They have turned it into a cheaper product that is no better in terms of ingredients than the cheaper version. I noticed the packaging is slightly different as are a number of others from their Indian range so I wonder whether they have changed supplier.;2016-09-01T20:33:58+0000;0

The recipe has been changed to include baking powder in the recipe that contains fortified wheat flour. This has been included as it helps to lighten the texture to give a more open texture which crisps up when fried. Wherever possible we try to limit allergens unless necessary. In this case we thought the addition of baking powder was necessary to improve the texture.""  - What a load of rubbish eh Poorna Prasad ?

Items with a use by date of the day of delivery are considered short life & are highlighted as such to allow the customer to send them back for a refund. Anything dates beyond this is not.

I contacted the Newton Abbot store. The issue related to the new parking regime which seems to have been initiated. I returned to my car to find I had been fined £30 for being parked not entirely in the bay in an almost empty car park. I am not disputing the facts but from where I was parked I could see no obvious signage (although of course that may well have changed since my conversation with the company that now manages the car park) I contacted Horizon and appealed providing photographs which showed that from where I was parked that there were no obvious signs visible. They rejected my appeal which I expected but it was worth a try. Lets face it a little while ago these companies were clamping cars and extorting money from drivers, but of course that particular source of income has been cut off so now they offer to manage carparks. I am however disappointed that Sainsbury's have got involved in this in my view racket but I am now more philisophical about the whole episode, my mistake cost me £30 but has already cost Sainsbury's more which makes me wonder about the financial sense of this arrangement. Whilst I accept that I was wrong and made a mistake I am more disappointed that the manager did not even respond to my letter handed in to customer services the following day.;2016-08-25T17:53:16+0000;1

All of the items I ordered have now gone into the 50% off sale!!! I m livid. I phoned the useless morons at your useless minimum wage call centre to be told you don t feel you apply to distance selling regs you won t refund me the difference despite the fact the goods HAVE NOT even left you you won t cancel my order and also you admit you think you re above the law! Can you tell me why? You ve got my goods my money and refuse to give me either? You won t even refund the difference which is all I asked! The ignorant cow I spoke to also argued for a good ten minutes that you didn t have a sale!!! When I told her to check the web page in front of her!! After 45 minutes if arguing and her continuous refusal to speak to a manager she out me into an I basil called Paula who admitted you don t go by distance selling regs you won t refund me not even the difference and you won t do anything. She s the manager of all Sainsbury s apparently as there s nobody higher to speak to.

When raising a complaint we do offer manager call backs and I can see you have already spoken with our manager Paula. If you wish to further your complaint you will need to write into our head office using the below address: Customer Services, Sainsbury's Supermarkets Ltd, London, EC1N 2HT.  You will then be contacted by head office (therefore please provide your contact details). If you would like to return your items you can return by post or store, however there will be a £3.50 returns charge when returning via post. We are unable to compensate you for the cost of travel to store as we have not failed to provide you with the services that we offer. If you need any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact us. Kind regards, Ryan.;2016-08-27T10:52:03+0000;0

Your Twitter team seem to have lost all ability to communicate  and I m not sure who has taken over your call centre but the 5 people I ve spoken to today have been pretty average to be fair  none of them sounded like the kind of people dressed head to toe in orange and beaming from ear to ear. One of them even cut me off. Another said  you can speak to a manager if you want but they ll only tell you the same as me   and I was promised a manager call back within 30 minutes  which is reasonably efficient. Unfortunately that was over an hour ago  and in the words of Diana Ross   I m still waiting.    The problem is with your fabulous offer which I gather is meant to attract new online customers  you know the one where you spend £60 or more and get £18 off? Ever the savvy shopper  I signed up tout suite and filled my basket with delicious goodies. I even read the T&Cs very carefully  which state  When using a promotional money off voucher the value of the goods other than spirits  liqueurs or wine when on any buy 6 save 25% multibuy must be at least equal to the money off offered by the promotional voucher.    Soooooo... The voucher offers £18 off  and the T&Cs say that at least that amount has to be made up of goods that are not spirits  liqueurs or wine  right? Of my basket which came to £68  over £30 of it isn t alcohol. Perfect!  Not perfect. The voucher code wasn t accepted  so I called  customer services  (I ve used apostrophes as the service was pretty non existent so I don t want anyone to do me under the Trades Descriptions Act). The man told me I had to spend £60 to qualify and that none of it could be alcohol. It doesn t say that anywhere!  I called again later and spoke to someone else  who told me he couldn t look at the order until I paid for it. He assured me that if I paid for it we could sort everything.  I paid for it. Then he cut me off whoooops.  I called back. The lady told me her colleague was correct and that I d not spent enough  and if I wanted to speak to someone in  customer care  that she could put me through. (Again  apostrophes re potential incorrect use of the word  care  - goodness me  this legal stuff is a nightmare  someone should write some T&Cs to clear things up.)  Then I spoke to Niamh in customer care! But she didn t care. She said I could speak to the manager but that he would only tell me the same thing. She also told me I needed to spend £6 more on non alcohol  and that if I took the vodka off the order and added a £6 steak that it would go through fine.   Stupid me! I did not know you sold a steak for £6 that could get me as drunk as a bottle of Russia s finest. Does it taste as good with lime and lemonade?  Anyway. The manager call was promised at 7.30pm by Niamh. She said all the managers were too busy to speak to me. She told me it would be within half an hour. That was 1.5 hours ago.   Oh  and she also told me that she understood exactly what the T&Cs meant. As if that meant it was OK for this new condition to just be an unsaid rule  a bit like a dirty secret.   I have to go now because it s the last in the series of Long Lost Family in a minute  and to be frank I m not even sure that one of Nicky Campbell s  specialist adoption intermediaries  could get me any further with you lot tonight.   What I will say is that if my order arrives on Friday without this being sorted (and/or with steak instead of vodka) I will look forward to our next set of correspondence with great delight!;2016-08-24T19:54:57+0000;10155143379429377_10155143455784377;d77bd1e1446d09d308db7b54b6fc8f2fd8e50c9b;1;Really Anthony?

The lady told me her colleague was correct and that I d not spent enough  and if I wanted to speak to someone in  customer care  that she could put me through. (Again  apostrophes re potential incorrect use of the word  care  - goodness me  this legal stuff is a nightmare  someone should write some T&Cs to clear things up.)  Then I spoke to Niamh in customer care! But she didn t care. She said I could speak to the manager but that he would only tell me the same thing. She also told me I needed to spend £6 more on non alcohol  and that if I took the vodka off the order and added a £6 steak that it would go through fine.   Stupid me! I did not know you sold a steak for £6 that could get me as drunk as a bottle of Russia s finest. Does it taste as good with lime and lemonade?  Anyway. The manager call was promised at 7.30pm by Niamh. She said all the managers were too busy to speak to me. She told me it would be within half an hour. That was 1.5 hours ago.   Oh  and she also told me that she understood exactly what the T&Cs meant. As if that meant it was OK for this new condition to just be an unsaid rule  a bit like a dirty secret.   I have to go now because it s the last in the series of Long Lost Family in a minute  and to be frank I m not even sure that one of Nicky Campbell s  specialist adoption intermediaries  could get me any further with you lot tonight.   What I will say is that if my order arrives on Friday without this being sorted (and/or with steak instead of vodka) I will look forward to our next set of correspondence with great delight!;2016-08-24T19:54:57+0000;10155143379429377_10155144831764377;79e7971f64f3e57bf2df89c2274336550a9d9cf5;0;Can I get you to write my letter of complaint to B & Q?;2016-08-25T05:43:46+0000;0

Your Twitter team seem to have lost all ability to communicate  and I m not sure who has taken over your call centre but the 5 people I ve spoken to today have been pretty average to be fair  none of them sounded like the kind of people dressed head to toe in orange and beaming from ear to ear. One of them even cut me off. Another said  you can speak to a manager if you want but they ll only tell you the same as me   and I was promised a manager call back within 30 minutes  which is reasonably efficient. Unfortunately that was over an hour ago  and in the words of Diana Ross   I m still waiting.    The problem is with your fabulous offer which I gather is meant to attract new online customers  you know the one where you spend £60 or more and get £18 off? Ever the savvy shopper  I signed up tout suite and filled my basket with delicious goodies. I even read the T&Cs very carefully  which state  When using a promotional money off voucher the value of the goods other than spirits  liqueurs or wine when on any buy 6 save 25% multibuy must be at least equal to the money off offered by the promotional voucher.    Soooooo... The voucher offers £18 off  and the T&Cs say that at least that amount has to be made up of goods that are not spirits  liqueurs or wine  right? Of my basket which came to £68  over £30 of it isn t alcohol. Perfect!  Not perfect. The voucher code wasn t accepted  so I called  customer services  (I ve used apostrophes as the service was pretty non existent so I don t want anyone to do me under the Trades Descriptions Act). The man told me I had to spend £60 to qualify and that none of it could be alcohol. It doesn t say that anywhere!  I called again later and spoke to someone else  who told me he couldn t look at the order until I paid for it. He assured me that if I paid for it we could sort everything.  I paid for it. Then he cut me off whoooops.  I called back. The lady told me her colleague was correct and that I d not spent enough  and if I wanted to speak to someone in  customer care  that she could put me through.

Nectar is not a scheme exclusive to Sainsbury's so it carries different restrictions than other loyalty cards exclusive to those retailers as it encompasses many different stores. Sainsbury's are also probably not willing to cover any damage done to someone's phone if a cashier accidentally drops it while trying to scan a bar code. A piece of plastic is much less valuable than a smart phone.;2016-08-24T22:38:30+0000;0

We run promotions and special offers to ensure our loyal customers get the best deal on shopping and these will change throughout the store. Sometimes we're able to keep the price down as low as possible or on special offer, but sometimes we need to increase the price of some of our items. While the price of the quavers may go up during that week, the cost of another may fall and we try to ensure we provide a great variety of deals. Which store is your local? I'll pass on your feedback to the relevant team so they're aware of your experience with the pricing. Ryan.;2016-08-24T08:02:09+0000;0

It could be possible the reason you're unable to buy them individually is that the store has chosen not to stock them in that way. Can you tell me what store you shop in?

Update Still waiting for a satisfactory response  And now the whole family feel a bit ill this morning as the other shopping was contaminated with the chicken blood that had leaked out of the packaging;2016-08-23T08:34:05+0000;10155138051034377_10155138168844377;cb150f10ca50547cc5cfdc4d23f25742bf23b11c;0;It's just you!.;2016-08-23T09:33:20+0000;0

I think you might be my favourite supermarket. I do wish  though  that  you wouldn t have cover photos on this page of things upsetting to vegans. You sell loads of lovely glassware  stationery  fruit  vegetables  clothes etc  plus  some excellent vegan products. Why not  please  picture these on the top of this page? Then you would make me happy  and I d say nice things about you on your page and be more likely to invite my vegan friends to be positive about you also. When I see something that upsets me as soon as I come to visit  I am not in the mood to scroll down further. I m more likely to complain instead - and share my complaint with my vegan friends.  I m looking forward to seeing your new vegan ice creams featured on the cover photo!;2016-08-23T08:22:50+0000;10155138034329377_10155138298324377;pageowner;0;The ice cream is going to be great Carol!

The other day  I visited your Brighton (Lewes Road) store and I must say  I wasn t very happy with the store.  The store is very dated and even in some places  the store is falling apart. It also has a whopping great big car park which is rarely full.   May I suggest that you knock the store down and re-build it?  Thanks :-);2016-08-23T07:32:09+0000;10155137953314377_10155138195414377;pageowner;0;Hey there. I've logged your comments onto our system to be taken into consideration.

I spoke to one of the pharmacists who said that they were not replacing any stock in the run up to the transfer to Lloyds, so as medicines ran out they were not replaced. Some medicines have already run out weeks before the transfer. I did not speak to anyone in the other store, it was obvious from the state of the shelves behind them that there would be the same problem.    The problem will get worse over the next couple of weeks until Lloyds take over. I can have a quick look when I next go shopping to confirm that the shelves are even more empty.    What you SHOULD have done is to continue to order replacement stock as necessary, and then simply transfer the inventory over to Lloyds on the day of the changeover.    I can see further problems there too, Lloyds will take over, but they will be faced with a pharmacy unit with no stock, and will have to order a large quantity to kick off, and this will be at every store. This could be such a big hit for the supply chain more used to smaller and regular restock orders that they might not be able to fill all the orders from all the stores in one go.    Fortunately, Tesco also have in-store pharmacies, and as they are not transferring them to anyone, have normal stock levels. I did not have to go without ;-)";2016-08-23T10:23:21+0000;0

This is where the pharmacist gave me the explanation. I also took a look in my local store, the big one in Bracknell, and there was a queue so couldn't speak to the pharmacist, but I could see that the situation was the same, some empty shelves and the rest dressed to make low stock appear more plentiful, but key products were still missing, presumably the popular ones that need to be restocked on a regular basis.     There are two more even bigger stores in my locality that are much better stocked with non food items, so if I go there I will have a look to see if their pharmacy also has empty shelves.    I was told by the original pharmacist that the changeover wasn't until 1st September, so it's a relatively long time to have nil stock of the most popular items.     I would expect a sale right at the end of August to shift the remaining stubborn stock, but there is unlikely to be anything I would want.;2016-08-23T11:45:46+0000;0

We bought  today  from Sainsbury s Emerson Green Bristol  Just Cook Chiken Thigh Fillets with Mushroom Stuffing  Red Wine Sauce & Oak Smoked Bacon. It states on the packet  cook for 30 minutes @ 170 degs. well after cooking for 30 Mins it was still raw in places so I cooked for 10 mins more  even then it was not cooked through so I gave it another 10 mins it appeared cooked this time so we tasted it. It was the most disgusting meal I have ever had  it was greasy full of fat and totally inedible. If this is the quality of Sainsbury s Just Cook meals I will be giving them a miss from now on and I would suggest anyone reading this does the same. Both my wife and myself have been left feeling very sick and totally dissatisfied.;2016-08-22T18:43:42+0000;10155136230649377_10155136249819377;pageowner;0;Really sorry Paul, are you and your wife alright?

I ve checked my bank transactions and between my partner and I we have spent over 3 grand there since January  so what follows came as a shock. As i live directly above your shop (My apartment is situated directly above sainsburys)  I park in the private car park belonging to the apartment complex. Unfortunately  my FOB had broke  and in desperate need of somewhere to park my car  I used the two spaces located next to the private bay. These are signed as  Visitors bays  for commodore court in our communal area  so i had thought it would be okay to leave it here  on a Sunday  whilst I arranged for a new FOB. you can imagine my shock when i returned only two hours later to find a parking charge on my car (in the perceived  visitors area )  especially given the fact i shop at sainsburys everyday and i had parked there previously without issue when FOB issues had arisen in the past.   I understand the need for deterrents when it comes to people misusing the car park  but here are the issues with this application :  1) I use sainsburys on a daily basis and live literally directly above it.  2) I was in no way hindering the use of the customer car park (i parked in two unmarked bays directly adjacent to the marked bay car park) 3) This was an unfortunate circumstance in which i was unable to gain access to the private car park for tennants use 4) There is signage in the communal area to the effect of these two bays being private and for visitors of the complex).   So you can understand my confusion and disappointment  especially when i wanted to talk to the store manager  but being told  we dont deal with the parking  sorry . As i mentioned before  my girlfriend and I used sainsburys on a daily basis  so this doesnt seem right that we are penalised for using what appears to be visitors parking bays for the Commodore Court complex. If this cannot be resolved  we will take our grocery needs elsewhere  as we have shopped at sainsburys everyday for over a year  and wouldnt want to give more money to you if you are unable to see the situation fairly.   I would appreciate if someone could contact me to discuss  as this has caused considerable stress  and would prefer an amicable solution instead of taking our business elsewhere.  Regards  Joe;2016-08-22T10:51:07+0000;10155134948054377_10155135150929377;b159a3121cb05ee7fff447665651fc7640f6c582;1;Not quite Kev, althought given the amount of information i can fit in the post, i can see why you came to that conclusion. The mitigating factor is the 2 parking bays outlined as visitor parking, as well as the change to culture sainsburys have in terms of these two spots. neither sainsburys or building management can confirm the nature of the spaces. So in short, 1) It isn't illegal, 2) The enforcement on these two bays is still in the air, and 3)due to the fact this is not a 'legal' matter, its the discretion of sainsburys, of which i have explained my factors in the hope they can understand the situation and apply common sense! This isn't as simple as 'parking in a bay > 60 mins = illegal'.;2016-08-22T12:09:38+0000;0

Unfortunately  my FOB had broke  and in desperate need of somewhere to park my car  I used the two spaces located next to the private bay. These are signed as  Visitors bays  for commodore court in our communal area  so i had thought it would be okay to leave it here  on a Sunday  whilst I arranged for a new FOB. you can imagine my shock when i returned only two hours later to find a parking charge on my car (in the perceived  visitors area )  especially given the fact i shop at sainsburys everyday and i had parked there previously without issue when FOB issues had arisen in the past.   I understand the need for deterrents when it comes to people misusing the car park  but here are the issues with this application :  1) I use sainsburys on a daily basis and live literally directly above it.  2) I was in no way hindering the use of the customer car park (i parked in two unmarked bays directly adjacent to the marked bay car park) 3) This was an unfortunate circumstance in which i was unable to gain access to the private car park for tennants use 4) There is signage in the communal area to the effect of these two bays being private and for visitors of the complex).   So you can understand my confusion and disappointment  especially when i wanted to talk to the store manager  but being told  we dont deal with the parking  sorry . As i mentioned before  my girlfriend and I used sainsburys on a daily basis  so this doesnt seem right that we are penalised for using what appears to be visitors parking bays for the Commodore Court complex.

Irrespective of what broke or didn't. You parked your vehicle in bays where you were not entitled to. I have no doubt the parking company knows just who is and is allowed  to park where you did and will have a list of residents car registrations. I have allocated parking too...if i were to use someone else's space...for whatever reason I would ( and quite rightly too) expect to fall foul of the parking management company.;2016-08-22T12:21:06+0000;0

Of course they dont have a list of registrations, as its a private car park for use by tennants adjacent to a car park for use with sainsburys. what falls under a grey area is the two bays umarked which reside directly next to the private bay,   These bays are open permanently and addressed within the communal area of the apartment complex as visitors bays.   If this is wrong, fine, but its the legal jurisdiction that i want to clarify as much as anything, as if we cannot use these as visitors bays then the entire complex must be made aware as others too use it as visitors bays.   Whilst it may be black and white to you Kev, in the eyes of business management (i.e. people qualified to make these sort of decisions) it comes down to more than ""were they here for 60 mins"". Because the pro's of a £30 fine don't outweigh the relationship you have with local residents/shoppers. and we couldnt be closer, we live literally above the shop. Sainsburys (up to this point) have always been helpful in these situations and therefore, whilst i understand what you mean by 'legal' (although using that terminology for private parking penalties is slightly exaggerated), one must look at the bigger picture, the fact that i do not park in this spot every day, that this was a one off in order for me to get access to my property, and that it didn't affect business as usual shoppers. This is why they have customer service representatives, as opposed to random facebookers settling disputes :);2016-08-22T12:39:15+0000;2

Tesco are continuing to sell what remains of their stock of JW tuna. They are NOT simply removing it from sale...that would be wasting perfectly good food. Food they had already bought and paid for from JW before all this blew up. They (tesco) will not be buying anymore tuna from JW until it is proved that JW fishing methods have been made more sustainable. Now whilst Sainsbury's may not have publicly announced they are doing the same, it would be folly of them not to be so doing. Continually spamming ( yes ' spamming) their page with the same agenda driven rubbish will not further the cause of sustainable fishing practices being adopted by JW nor will it motivate Sainsbury's to look kindly on the campaign. All you are doing is alienating yourselves from the public gaze and are being dismissed as cranks. Do yourselves a favour...turn your attentions to the root of the problem JOHN WEST and stop attempting to bully retailers into acquiescing to your demands.;2016-08-22T11:04:04+0000;0

As I said in my original post, the sainsburys I visited was in Prestbury - the exact address is Priors Road, GL52 5AQ. If Nicholas has been liasing with the wrong store, I'd be keen to understand how the employee who served me could be apologetic as she served me in the Priors Road Store - which begs the question have I just been fobbed off with a letter or has anything actually been done about this - has any form of coaching been given to staff NOT to enquire on a woman's perceived ""pregnancy"" if she has not given any detail that she might be pregnant. No wonder ""Phil"" looked aghast when he asked what the hamper and flowers were for and I told him exactly what had happened. I've had journalists try and contact me about this but I thought you guys were rectifying the situation so I declined to give an interview, but now I'm feeling like Sainsburys has attempted to fob me off. I don't give a monkies about a hamper or flowers, that was a nice surprise (had I received them) what I care about is that now I've highlighted the issue, that no other woman is ever put in the same situation as me in one of your stores.;2016-09-10T09:12:01+0000;0

As is part of our strict policies and procedures at Sainsbury’s our suppliers are asked to re validate this information routinely. On this product the nutritional results for this product have recently been re-validated which highlighted that the fibre result declared on the packaging was higher than in the pack. We therefore have updated the fibre result, however this resulted in the carbohydrate figure increasing from 43g per pack to 72g per pack. The figure on the back of the pack is available carbohydrate which is calculated by subtracting the fibre result from the total carbohydrate result Therefore, as the fibre figure has decreased in value, the available carbohydrate has increased.  The product itself has not changed in terms of the recipe contributing factors can be due to the natural variation in the vegetables within the product or within analytical testing. The website will be updated as soon as possible to reflect the change in the packaging. I hope this helps. Maryclare;2016-08-23T09:21:50+0000;0

I just thought if that was my mum I d would like to think that someone would ask if she was alright! So I walked over  blocking some ignorant shoppers offered to take her trolley to the car and off load her shopping  the lady cried as she said that she often struggles and she gets so frustrated with herself. She had an adapted car so could drive home and promised me she would ask her neighbour for help to put the shopping away. Where has respect and common decency for others gone!

Was it because I was asking about an issue you don t want to address?  I was asking why lots of own brand products such as porridge were  packed in materials that were NOT RECYCABLE when similar items by branded manufactures were packaged in recycable materials. Does facebook have an answer???;2016-08-20T13:03:48+0000;10155128055424377_10155128252729377;pageowner;0;Sorry you've not had a response Elizabeth! What is the email address you sent it to? We share your concerns about the effects of plastic on the environment and, for a number of years, have been focused on reducing our packaging. One of our aims, as part of our 20x20 Sustainability Plan, is to reduce it by half compared to 2005. Each time we review a product, we also review the packaging. The challenge we face is to reduce packaging without sacrificing its importance and effectiveness on the freshness and safety of our products. Most importantly, it must protect the product for our customers and then, where possible, use recyclable material. You can find more information here http://bit.ly/2b5IcTN.

Since yesterday this wasnt the case this comes across as a complete scam and I m disgusted by your approach to change this and not show your customer the 25% that you are now falsely advertising as there is no commitment in the order sheet that you must apply the discount.

Unfortunately this is an issue that we'll be unable to assist with. You'll need to discuss this with the card issuer. When our till systems activate the gift card, the sale won't process unless the activation has been successful. If the system can't activate the card, the cashier will be informed and the transaction will not proceed. As you mentioned above, you were charged correctly for the gift card and obtained a receipt to show the purchase had gone through and once the purchase has been made, any issues such as with activation or usage need to be handled by the card issuer. Did you pay for it by card, Kat? If so, we can use a credit or debit card statement to locate your proof of purchase and obtain a copy of it. You'd be able to use this proof of purchase when contacting the card issuer to verify the purchase and hopefully they'll be able to resolve and activate the card for you.

I ve recently moved to Bridgnorth in Shropshire & the main supermarkets are Aldi & Sainsbury s.  Aldi is great  but I can t do a full family shop there (in part because my eldest daughter has a nut allergy)  so would love to try Sainsbury s.  Where I used to live in Congleton  Cheshire the supermarkets were Aldi & Tesco & Morrison s.  Morrison s was great - all the trolleys are doubles.  Tesco is awesome.  I pull into a mother & child space & there are a selection of trolleys right there.  I now find myself having to drive almost 30 minutes to the nearest Tesco in Telford or shopping online with Tesco.   I would love to try Sainsbury s  but it seems there is a strict limit to how many children are allowed in store at any one time?!?   Move over Challenge 25  Sainsbury s have Challenge children.   I accept I may never get one of the three mother & child spaces (I also stopped playing the lottery)  that s okay  I m small enough to help my kids squeeze in & out of the car doors  but once that challenge is complete I then find myself unable to shop because there is never a trolley!  I m informed by the very helpful  trolley man  that there are two double trolleys.  Two!!!!!  So only two mothers/families with more than one young child can shop at a time.  Iv e only been here a few weeks  but Bridgnorth appears to have an average number of children!   I have twins as do many other women & many more have two or more young children.   I accept you policy  but is there a possibility of introducing a rota system for the trolleys  so I can book one in advance?  Maybe a barrier with a guard to check the number of children in the car before allowing entry to the car-park would save the disappointment of parking & squeezing out of the car only to get straight back in to drive to Tesco.  Maybe just a blanket ban on people carriers?  A member of staff on the door to confiscate the extra child/children & issue a receipt for their return at checkout  subject to a minimum £40 spend of course.  Free condoms provided to shoppers who already have one child? Although that would take a few years to have an effect.    Please help!  There must be a solution so that the people of Bridgnorth who have more than one child can shop with you.

Although you do have some interesting ideas, some of them would be very difficult to enact, as I'm sure you're aware! The solution, I think, is to have more of those double trolleys. I've passed on your feedback to the store, and asked that they get some more of these trollies in. I would encourage you to make the same request when you're in store also. Hopefully you can shop with us comfortably in the near future! Daryl.;2016-08-20T16:03:09+0000;1

All because he didn't read the delivery notes on how to get to my house safely rather than parking on a main road and walking a longer distance to my house the fool xx;2016-08-19T09:41:34+0000;0

After phoning and being told that they would allow us to use their meeting room to have the snack we purchase in store - we set off from nursery with excited children.  Arriving  we looked around Sainsburys  and the children used the self-checkout to scan and pay for the snack they had chosen. We were then approach by a Sainsburys employee asking if we were the school they were anticipating - proceeding to give all the children a  behind the scenes  tour!   Much  much more than we expected and the children had an absolute blast - so good considering we only phoned the day before! And the employee (Stephen) was more than happy to do it again for our afternoon class!   Thanks so much to Stephen and the rest of the Sainsburys staff who accomodated us fantastically! We ll definately take you up on your offer to come again! 😄;2016-08-18T19:40:41+0000;10155122492889377_10155124081984377;pageowner;0;That's really great to hear Danielle! I'm so pleased Stephen and the other colleagues were able to give the kids a fun morning/afternoon. I've passed your lovely feedback on to the store's management team.

I ve just wasted ten minutes of my lunchtime searching a) for a car park payment machine that was working and b) searching for a car park payment machine that was directed to by a  Pay At Meter  sign. Neither of which existed today. Might have been an idea to put signs on the meters saying none of them were working. This would have helped several other people wandering around searching for things that didn t exist. And if that wasn t bad enough when I needed authorisation at the self service checkout  the assistant standing not 10 feet (yes  less than 10 feet) away from me was looking in every direction bar the one she should have been. Those tills are not exactly quiet. A quick ten minute shop turned into half an hour of pain.

I generally shop of an evening as I work and find evenings quieter  which generally means this is a quicker experience.  This evening  the whole experience took over 2 hours and I have been banned from using the store by the Duty Manager and was unable to purchase my shopping.   I purchased a large shop and was at the check out when a customer in front spoke with me and I replied to the customer with a comment regarding a dog.  At this very point  the cashier says  I m calling my Manager as you have a dog in your bag .  My first thoughts were that the cashier was not very bright and mildly entertaining as there was no reason to believe this to be the case.  I then realise that the cashier was serious and makes several phone calls whilst I am left standing at the check out.  I ask her to stop wasting time and  stop being a jobs worth  she then comments   I have to tell my Manager .  After around 15 minutes I was so fed up with the nonsense that I walked out of the store and left my bag in the car.  On my return  the Manageress appears.  I explain that I am unimpressed by this behavior of being accused of having a dog in my bag when the Manageress says  I have been rude to her staff and she will not serve me in her store   I am outraged at this stupidity and I am told by the Manageress that I said   her staff was a  jobs-worth . As a busy person who does my shopping at this store every week and spend somewhere in the region of £650 per month  I am appalled at the accusations I have been accused of  not to mention the time wasting.   Having read in the news last week that Sainsbury s had an incident with a gay customer kissing  I am wondering whether their staff are secretly sabotaging their business.   I felt it necessary to let other customers know of this crazy experience  which incidentally was witnessed by many  one of which has given me his details as he suggested I approach the local newspaper with this crazy story.   I will of course approach them tomorrow along with the Independent who was happy to print the story of the gay couple.

This is why you were asked to remove the dog as the only animals allowed in store are assistance dogs. We encourage our managers to make their own decisions to protect the best interests of the store and our customers. They are within their rights to ask a customer to leave store if they feel that a customer is behaving inappropriately. If you do want to follow this up, I'd suggest that you write directly to the Regional Operations Manager, so that the decision can be reviewed. You can write to them at: Howard Road Chafford Hundred GRAYS RM16 6YJ. Thanks, Danny.;2016-08-18T12:33:17+0000;13

I generally shop of an evening as I work and find evenings quieter  which generally means this is a quicker experience.  This evening  the whole experience took over 2 hours and I have been banned from using the store by the Duty Manager and was unable to purchase my shopping.   I purchased a large shop and was at the check out when a customer in front spoke with me and I replied to the customer with a comment regarding a dog.  At this very point  the cashier says  I m calling my Manager as you have a dog in your bag .  My first thoughts were that the cashier was not very bright and mildly entertaining as there was no reason to believe this to be the case.  I then realise that the cashier was serious and makes several phone calls whilst I am left standing at the check out.  I ask her to stop wasting time and  stop being a jobs worth  she then comments   I have to tell my Manager .  After around 15 minutes I was so fed up with the nonsense that I walked out of the store and left my bag in the car.  On my return  the Manageress appears.  I explain that I am unimpressed by this behavior of being accused of having a dog in my bag when the Manageress says  I have been rude to her staff and she will not serve me in her store   I am outraged at this stupidity and I am told by the Manageress that I said   her staff was a  jobs-worth . As a busy person who does my shopping at this store every week and spend somewhere in the region of £650 per month  I am appalled at the accusations I have been accused of  not to mention the time wasting.   Having read in the news last week that Sainsbury s had an incident with a gay customer kissing  I am wondering whether their staff are secretly sabotaging their business.   I felt it necessary to let other customers know of this crazy experience  which incidentally was witnessed by many  one of which has given me his details as he suggested I approach the local newspaper with this crazy story.   I will of course approach them tomorrow along with the Independent who was happy to print the story of the gay couple.

I generally shop of an evening as I work and find evenings quieter  which generally means this is a quicker experience.  This evening  the whole experience took over 2 hours and I have been banned from using the store by the Duty Manager and was unable to purchase my shopping.   I purchased a large shop and was at the check out when a customer in front spoke with me and I replied to the customer with a comment regarding a dog.  At this very point  the cashier says  I m calling my Manager as you have a dog in your bag .  My first thoughts were that the cashier was not very bright and mildly entertaining as there was no reason to believe this to be the case.  I then realise that the cashier was serious and makes several phone calls whilst I am left standing at the check out.  I ask her to stop wasting time and  stop being a jobs worth  she then comments   I have to tell my Manager .  After around 15 minutes I was so fed up with the nonsense that I walked out of the store and left my bag in the car.  On my return  the Manageress appears.  I explain that I am unimpressed by this behavior of being accused of having a dog in my bag when the Manageress says  I have been rude to her staff and she will not serve me in her store   I am outraged at this stupidity and I am told by the Manageress that I said   her staff was a  jobs-worth . As a busy person who does my shopping at this store every week and spend somewhere in the region of £650 per month  I am appalled at the accusations I have been accused of  not to mention the time wasting.   Having read in the news last week that Sainsbury s had an incident with a gay customer kissing  I am wondering whether their staff are secretly sabotaging their business.   I felt it necessary to let other customers know of this crazy experience  which incidentally was witnessed by many  one of which has given me his details as he suggested I approach the local newspaper with this crazy story.   I will of course approach them tomorrow along with the Independent who was happy to print the story of the gay couple.   Sainsbury s  if you care to see the colour of my money again I expect an apology from the staff which behaved appalling this evening and wasted several hours of my valuable time  and off course more time tomorrow shopping at Waitrose  where I am only ever treated with such great customer service.;2016-08-17T23:39:34+0000;10155119719294377_10155121211244377;e8a34451a31bfc98538990e2948350b77533b568;1;So why not just open the bag and prove no dog if indeed there wasn't one?

This cashier had no reason to poke her nose in my bag.  I've wasted enough time on this and hopefully once they check the cctv footage they will apologise.  I did however show the independent witness the content of my bag.  He was a little embarrassed at the content but couldn't find a dog.

My brief discussion with her regarding my dog, was changed by the idiot on the check out to believe I had a dog in the bag.   You've missed the issue.  I was not served because I said the cashier was a jobs worth and her stupidity held everybody up.  So I was asked to leave because they say I was rude. I made a factually correct statement.

I generally shop of an evening as I work and find evenings quieter  which generally means this is a quicker experience.  This evening  the whole experience took over 2 hours and I have been banned from using the store by the Duty Manager and was unable to purchase my shopping.   I purchased a large shop and was at the check out when a customer in front spoke with me and I replied to the customer with a comment regarding a dog.  At this very point  the cashier says  I m calling my Manager as you have a dog in your bag .  My first thoughts were that the cashier was not very bright and mildly entertaining as there was no reason to believe this to be the case.  I then realise that the cashier was serious and makes several phone calls whilst I am left standing at the check out.  I ask her to stop wasting time and  stop being a jobs worth  she then comments   I have to tell my Manager .  After around 15 minutes I was so fed up with the nonsense that I walked out of the store and left my bag in the car.  On my return  the Manageress appears.  I explain that I am unimpressed by this behavior of being accused of having a dog in my bag when the Manageress says  I have been rude to her staff and she will not serve me in her store   I am outraged at this stupidity and I am told by the Manageress that I said   her staff was a  jobs-worth . As a busy person who does my shopping at this store every week and spend somewhere in the region of £650 per month  I am appalled at the accusations I have been accused of  not to mention the time wasting.

I generally shop of an evening as I work and find evenings quieter  which generally means this is a quicker experience.  This evening  the whole experience took over 2 hours and I have been banned from using the store by the Duty Manager and was unable to purchase my shopping.   I purchased a large shop and was at the check out when a customer in front spoke with me and I replied to the customer with a comment regarding a dog.  At this very point  the cashier says  I m calling my Manager as you have a dog in your bag .  My first thoughts were that the cashier was not very bright and mildly entertaining as there was no reason to believe this to be the case.  I then realise that the cashier was serious and makes several phone calls whilst I am left standing at the check out.  I ask her to stop wasting time and  stop being a jobs worth  she then comments   I have to tell my Manager .  After around 15 minutes I was so fed up with the nonsense that I walked out of the store and left my bag in the car.  On my return  the Manageress appears.  I explain that I am unimpressed by this behavior of being accused of having a dog in my bag when the Manageress says  I have been rude to her staff and she will not serve me in her store   I am outraged at this stupidity and I am told by the Manageress that I said   her staff was a  jobs-worth .

I will of course approach them tomorrow along with the Independent who was happy to print the story of the gay couple.   Sainsbury s  if you care to see the colour of my money again I expect an apology from the staff which behaved appalling this evening and wasted several hours of my valuable time  and off course more time tomorrow shopping at Waitrose  where I am only ever treated with such great customer service.;2016-08-17T23:39:34+0000;10155119719294377_10155122403709377;bb684013c7c6c2444547560d63a42da9ceba0180;0;Too true.

I generally shop of an evening as I work and find evenings quieter  which generally means this is a quicker experience.  This evening  the whole experience took over 2 hours and I have been banned from using the store by the Duty Manager and was unable to purchase my shopping.   I purchased a large shop and was at the check out when a customer in front spoke with me and I replied to the customer with a comment regarding a dog.  At this very point  the cashier says  I m calling my Manager as you have a dog in your bag .  My first thoughts were that the cashier was not very bright and mildly entertaining as there was no reason to believe this to be the case.  I then realise that the cashier was serious and makes several phone calls whilst I am left standing at the check out.  I ask her to stop wasting time and  stop being a jobs worth  she then comments   I have to tell my Manager .  After around 15 minutes I was so fed up with the nonsense that I walked out of the store and left my bag in the car.  On my return  the Manageress appears.  I explain that I am unimpressed by this behavior of being accused of having a dog in my bag when the Manageress says  I have been rude to her staff and she will not serve me in her store   I am outraged at this stupidity and I am told by the Manageress that I said   her staff was a  jobs-worth .

I generally shop of an evening as I work and find evenings quieter  which generally means this is a quicker experience.  This evening  the whole experience took over 2 hours and I have been banned from using the store by the Duty Manager and was unable to purchase my shopping.   I purchased a large shop and was at the check out when a customer in front spoke with me and I replied to the customer with a comment regarding a dog.  At this very point  the cashier says  I m calling my Manager as you have a dog in your bag .  My first thoughts were that the cashier was not very bright and mildly entertaining as there was no reason to believe this to be the case.  I then realise that the cashier was serious and makes several phone calls whilst I am left standing at the check out.  I ask her to stop wasting time and  stop being a jobs worth  she then comments   I have to tell my Manager .  After around 15 minutes I was so fed up with the nonsense that I walked out of the store and left my bag in the car.  On my return  the Manageress appears.  I explain that I am unimpressed by this behavior of being accused of having a dog in my bag when the Manageress says  I have been rude to her staff and she will not serve me in her store   I am outraged at this stupidity and I am told by the Manageress that I said   her staff was a  jobs-worth . As a busy person who does my shopping at this store every week and spend somewhere in the region of £650 per month  I am appalled at the accusations I have been accused of  not to mention the time wasting.   Having read in the news last week that Sainsbury s had an incident with a gay customer kissing  I am wondering whether their staff are secretly sabotaging their business.

The chicken was so pumped full of water it was inedible  there was a very thin and tasteless rasher of bacon and the mozzarella was almost non existent.  I do not understand why our food needs to be treated way  I doubt Jamie Oliver or Delia Smith would expect this appalling food.  Could I suggest a product code for the future of 5H1T.

In relation to the use of BPA and by way of background to this issue, EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) and the UK Food Standards Agency have conducted detailed assessments and concluded that it's safe for use in packaging providing it remains within specified limits. Hence, there's been no recommendation to stop using bisphenol A (BPA) in food packaging although EFSA have recommended that further research is conducted. The majority of can manufacturers still use BPA based lacquers on the inside of their cans to prevent acidic foods coming into contact with the metal of the can which would otherwise result in unsafe levels of tin leaching into the product. This means that Sainsbury’s own brand cans do contain a small amount of BPA within the recommended limits. We're aware that some of our customers are uncomfortable with the use of BPA and we have been looking at alternative forms of packaging. One result of this work has been the introduction of chopped tomatoes in Tetra Pak as this form of packaging does not contain BPA. Chris.;2016-08-17T18:46:27+0000;0

I said the only thing I could being put under such pressure I panicked and said I'd heard him the 1st 3 times. His response was that he had been talking to other people in the queue yet he was glaring at me and demanding the response. he then notched up his aggressive behavior when I pointed out that he had been glaring at me and having repeated himself 3 times whilst glaring at me was the demanding my full attention. At this point he told me I wouldn't be served at all. I tried to move forwards towards the cashier who is now ready to serve me and was physically obstructed by the security guard. At this point he threatened me with physical violence and I suggested he should really consider it carefully. I had a panic attack drop my goods where they were and walked out. I grew up in Johannesburg and have not felt that threatened by someone else since living there in 97.  What measures can be taken to make sure this never happens again? And what other action can be taken to make sure that she can never operate like this again?;2016-08-19T08:52:38+0000;0

We have horizon operators onsite who will support customers doing this. Cashiers should ask customers if they need a voucher. If you did stay more than 2 hours you'll receive a fine in the post, which may have already been issued. If you get it, please send a photo of your receipt plus the details of the reg car and the store will have it cancelled for you. Daryl.;2016-08-17T06:58:51+0000;0

Customers need to present their actual card or have their receipt validated to add the points the next time they're in store. Customers are also able to redeem points in all our stores. To do this at the checkout, you must have shopped in that store within the last 12 months. If you haven't, our store colleagues are able to perform a Nectar workaround. This involves one of our colleagues calling the Nectar helpline during their opening hours and then passing the phone to you to confirm some security questions. Danny.;2016-08-16T13:52:31+0000;0

Most stores now have a container and each store could put its products into that.  I see your point about cost but the thing is that Tesco have withdrawn a number of John West products as they are not sustainably fished so there's no reason why Sainsbury's can't do the same.

Can Sainsburts be a leader in ethical produce too?;2016-08-16T06:49:04+0000;10155113906984377_10155114085094377;3d5cac60ec0cc76e5d9c8a75046d2f812e33c550;0;Electrofishing?

Primarily we'll try to source as much of our produce from the UK because we love supporting out local farmers are growers. We totally understand the importance of local sourcing, however sometimes we do need to source produce from other locales. It can come down to a variety of factors which include supply and demand among others. What time were you in-store when this happened? I'll ensure this is fed back to the store manager as our colleagues should not be giving out false information. Ryan.;2016-08-19T12:09:27+0000;1

I'm a big fan of going ""taps aff"" whether it be in the garden, on the beach or at a swimming pool.  I also like to hang out with my wang out when at home.  I appreciate that everyone has different beliefs, opinions and tolerances which is why I have the decency to wear at least a vest when I go shopping.  You've also got to take into account equality and where to draw a line. If a topless boy isn't offensive then a topless man shouldn't be either and if a topless man is okay then many would then push for topless women to be granted freedom to shop. Whilst I would be okay with this, I also appreciate the mass panic, confusion and embarrassment that would ensue when a young bag packer gets told to ""mind those baps"" or ""careful with my melons so I guess the best solution is just to dress your kids appropriately for the task in hand.;2016-08-13T23:52:41+0000;4

Generally, you must put something in to the machine in order to also get something, in this case - a delicious loaf, out of it. I'd recommend a combination of water, yeast, flour, salt and sugar.

As all you are doing if you sell me today via home delivery with today's expiry date is possibly causing the customer to waste the item and throw in the bin as most people are not going to use a weeks worth of meat in a day are they. Also most people would not realise or think to check on the day of delivery if the item goes out of date the same day so by the time they realise the meat is out of date. So all you are doing really is passing the waste cost onto the buyer! Not very environmentally friendly is it Sainsburys;2016-08-12T09:17:18+0000;1

I have been doing online shopping with you for over 9 years and during all that time I have had my Favourites as a Single List. Within that single list  all items have been grouped into categories such as fresh produce  dairy  meat  drinks  food cupboard  household etc  generally following the layout of a store. Now two weeks ago you have implemented an update and my single list of favourite items are now just listed in alphabetical order. So for example  different types of cold meat  pates  etc are listed by the brand or store name and no longer grouped together. Even different sizes of Sainsburys brand of milk cartons are no longer listed together because of the size difference of 1 pint  2 pint and 4 pint. Whereas previously  I could see at a glance everything in a category everything is now muddled and instead of just clicking through 9 pages in 10 minutes  my orders are taking nearer 30 minutes to complete because I m having to check  that I haven t missed anything. If I go to Favourites by Aisle  I then have to click on each aisle listing to then find a product which is very time-consuming and not as quick as the old layout. I might as well just go through each category of the food groceries and I feel this change makes a nonsense of having Favourites. Why did you have to change the layout of the Favourites as a single list. It was so easy and quick which is what online shopping is meant to be about  not having to check and recheck my trolley to make sure I haven t missed anything. I phoned the online shopping line today to complain but of course  no-one can say why this has happened and of course  we are now stuck with a stupid useless list.  Do these people who implement these updates actually use the website each week and understand how consumers actually use the website  no  someone comes up with some silly idea and thinks its an  improvement ! If you can implements  updates  then please reinstate the groupings within the Favourites as a Single list. I m sure its not that difficult. And will anyone actually take any notice of my post or will it just be ignored.

They want this tuna removing from shelves but dont realise that stocks were bought and paid for in good faith from John West long before this bandwagon set off rolling. Its simply not a case of removing them from sale, its still good food and wasting it is not an option. John west have already been paid for the tins already in supermarkets, they are not on a sale or return basis and must be sold. The quickest way to get them off the shelves is to BUY them and demand The retailer orders no more from John West until they prove they have cleaned up their acts...just like Tesco have done. Btw, Tesco are still selling the remaining stocks too...it would be silly and wasteful not to.

The address wasn t present and a statement came up saying if the address isn t on the last we don t deliver there. So I tried you and hey presto.

Soya milk can sometimes be classed as a long life dairy alternative, and this may explain why it's situated differently. I can see that the store receives regular deliveries of this item, so if you have any trouble in future, please ask a colleague in-store for assistance as they will be able to help you find any items you're looking for.

I'm sorry for the confusion. We don't stock every item in every store, and this may explain why you're unable to get hold of the yellow polo shirt. If you'd like, I can log a product request for you to make our team aware of the interest in this style? You'll just need to provide me with an e-mail address so that we can contact you once it's in stock. Also, if you're looking for it sooner rather than later, a personal recommendation from myself would be to arrange a click and collect order if it's available online.

I ve been asked this now for nearly a week following my latest experience with Sainsbury s where I along with my son were subjected to verbal abuse and having my car keys stolen along with my house keys and other important items. It certainly is stressing. It certainly was a shock. It is also being stranded and its certainly is being a victim. However. the best definition for  Taste the Difference  has to be in that magical word  Difference . Whilst the retail industry is constantly fight losses due to shop lifting by employing security and relying on the powers of the law for convictions  the  Taste the Difference  is the complete opposite. This is where an innocent disabled person  along with their family  is subjected not only to verbal abuse  but having Sainsbury s break into their car and steal property  leaving the customer in a distressed state  abandoned and helpless  and relying on the emergency services (police) for help. So  Taste the Difference  is Sainsbury s way of  fighting back  !!! It s been nearly a week and the experience is still fresh and a talking point within our community and certainly before they built Sainsbury s (Knaphill  Surrey). I still urge people to avoid shopping there and to consider alternatives such as Waitrose in Goldsworth Park and Morrisons in Woking  where I believe they value customers irrespective if they have a disability and also do not practise  Tasting the Difference  with their customers - more of a great shopping experience.

I've spoken with a colleague in the cafe who apologises for your poor experience. He did say that Mondays are peak evenings in the cafe in terms of customers, hence the shortage of food, which was not helped by the backlog of orders. Rest assured, your feedback will be logged and reviewed by management so we can avoid this happening again in the future. In the meantime, send us your Nectar details and we'll have some points added as way of apology for the substandard trip. Thanks! Kip;2016-08-10T07:48:24+0000;0

If the fault has been caused by a manufacturing defect, we'll be able to help but you'll need to obtain an independent engineers report that proves this. It's important to note that you will also require proof of purchase if the item is deemed to have a manufacturing fault. I hope this helps. Ryan.;2016-08-09T17:56:42+0000;0

As we don't offer same day delivery for grocery products, our online grocery website displays prices for the following day, which would be the first available delivery date.  This means that some promotions show on our website a day earlier than they would in store. Hope this helps, Sam.;2016-08-09T14:09:16+0000;0

And he still went ahead and handed items over knowing it was not me..in my case I am lucky they where just deliverd to my mother.. it cud have been a complete stranger as he was willing to hand over knowing full well it was not myself  They delivery driver even spoke to mum who had no clue why groceries turned up at her door. When he mentioned my name i.e knowing it was not me my mum accepted thinking I had done her a nice little suprise im sure she was gutted to find out that I had not.. poor thing..  So after a long conversation with the online support team I decided was best just to leave items there as it s lurgan and in in Belfast can t just nip down and collect them so I said I will tmoz.. but the girl from the online team refused to even raise it as a complaint as she put it the store done nothing wrong.. which was very patronising  and infuriating..  How can a company not return fresh produce that had been literally handed over in the two minutes took to contact them and drag the conversation on for 45 minutes.

I can log a product request to make our buyers aware of the interest for you and see if we can start stocking it again, though! Can you confirm which store you shop in and PM me your e-mail address? You'll get an e-mail to let you know if we're going to stock it again. Ryan.;2016-08-09T10:33:40+0000;1

To make a complaint about the online service  I need to speak with the same online service about which I would like to complain - rubbish. I tried that  it didn t work. All they do is pay me lip service with no action. Poor service response and no adequate complaints and reconciliation procedure  equals a lost customer. 5 years shopping with Sainsbury and ended with one call. I hope that approach continues to work well for you. Order # 43696133.;2016-08-09T07:55:33+0000;10155091924419377_10155092150004377;pageowner;0;Hi Devon!

Just to refresh some readers this was following  Taste the Difference  treatment from Sainsbury s that extended from their products to include their services where by I was verbally abused on three occasions and later with my son. Worst was to come when they entered my private vehicle and stole my car keys along with house keys and others. Being distressed and stranded without my property and the refusal of Sainsbury s to return these forced me to call the wonderful services of the Surrey Police services who retrieved these from me. No apology to date to both myself and son. Perhaps  Taste the Difference  brand is above the law. In any case  I would like to remind all those that are away on holiday that upon your return (and the online shopping in advance) and those that are about to go away to not shop at Sainsbury s (Knaphill) or any other branch  and if you have to  then please do not purchase a single item that you was going to.

He had been given a visa debit gift card for his birthday and i didn t think twice about handing this over to the cashier  sainsburys being a major retailer after all. I was told that sainsburys systems are not set up to accept these cards  despite the terms and conditions clearly stating they are accepted anywhere that accepts debit cards. I was  therefore unable to use it. I spoke to customer services who were also unable to accept this card. I then spoke to a manager who suggested that i ought to speak to the card provider.

We do take Visa debit gift cards, but the store have confirmed the card wasn't working when you were in store. Unfortunately if it's not working we don't have any way to look into this, but if you've checked with the card provider and it's okay you should be able to use it now.

I just think a bit of common sense should have been shown (ie, why would an teenage drinker claim to be 35 when 18 would be much more believable? Aren't there more affordable sources of alcohol than champagne for a 17 year old with no income from employment/benefits?). As I said, I've no issue whatsoever with the second member of staff, who was doing her job correctly in facilitating a legitimate purchase from a clearly adult customer.;2016-08-07T12:42:38+0000;2

It is appalling how much food is wasted every day;2016-08-05T19:34:38+0000;10155081015479377_10155081261524377;pageowner;0;Hi Jasmine, unfortunately we can't increase it more than we already have. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure no wonky fruit or veg goes to waste. You'll find the slightly less appealing (on the visual scale, they're still just as yummy) fruit and veg in our Basics range and also in our ready meals. You can read more on this here:  http://bit.ly/1AmDzGP and also more on our recent drive to help stop people wasting good bananas here: http://bit.ly/2akfk6H. Did you know that 162 million bananas are binned every year! Ridiculous! Ryan.;2016-08-05T21:22:56+0000;1

Sometimes we'll get deliveries which may go on shelf, but this depends on the item and the store as some stock will not go out until the next day. Also, the store that your shopping comes from may differ to the store you shop in person. Apologies for the inconvenience. Ryan.;2016-08-05T21:22:28+0000;1

The police were called and were making their way to us as the manager of Hampton Sainsburys came over and was extremely boisterous towards me telling me I wasn t allowed my bike in his shop  the security guard explained to him the circumstances and why I was there but he just basically took sides with the van driver  with how he was acting towards me it really seemed as if the pair of them just hates cyclists. The manager continued to be dismissive of me being there and tried snatching my bike out of my hands for no reason  I pulled it back and told him there is no need for him to touch me or my personal property  he then grabbed it again and pulled it away from me  he lost grip of it  and the bike fell on your clothing stand  which resulted in my front hub on my wheel being broken. This wheel now has to be sent back to France where they made it for it to be fixed at my expense and taking two weeks  I am now without a mode of transport.

I had the receipt and tried to take it back the next day to exchange it for the correct one. The tin had not been opened. I was told by customer service (in store) that there was nothing that they could do about it as it was Sainburys procedure not to exchange baby milk as someone had tampered with a tin before and bought it back and a baby become ill. I felt upset and angry that I had been tarred with the same brush with the dreadful actions of someone else.  However  can t this be said about all the products you sell ?

We once bought the wrong type and donated it. Animal shelters etc will take it for feeding baby animals etc.  Write off the £10 to experience and consider donating the milk to your local animal shelter or something. Or possibly there's a friend who could use it for their baby?  Also if I purchased baby milk off the shelf, I'd want to be sure it hasn't been purchased before and returned as who knows what the previous owner has done with it or what conditions they've stored it in etc.  Not a big deal really - and not worth getting upset over. Especially as amazingly they have offered you a £10 gift voucher for your mistake. In my opinion that's superb service as I can guarantee no other retailer would offer you the £10 voucher.;2016-08-05T05:24:06+0000;7

My concern is what will happen to  the 'perfect ' fruit and veg , that will not be sold as a result of shoppers switching  over. Most customers  buy the same quantity quantities of fruit and veg , each week, If they want carrots, for example,  and switch to a bag of  wonky carrots,  this will mean their regular bag of carrots remains unsold. Is there a danger of  replacing one  mountain of waste with another?  What is the answer,  should growers produce less  crops,  should we all eat more ? Any thoughts ?;2016-08-04T23:03:28+0000;0

This is from the Angel branch. I have contacted him but he said he will try but there may not much he can do about. What I found frustrating the most is that u use the ticket machine system to measure the staying with the card so if it was out of use then how can they give me the ticket. I didn't think that I went over the limit! £130 is a big amount of money. Thanks Chris;2016-08-04T15:26:18+0000;0

The manager Peter He wasn't helpful at all, he asked me to prove the receipt of my purchase and I said "" come on, please reasonable the date of the parking notice was the 5th of May, if I knew the parking ticket was existed I would kept the receipt but I didn't even know it was there in the  first place"" then he said "" don't use the word come on here to me"". I offer to give him my Nectar card and my family Nectar cards as well as we all shop here and you can see how often and how much we spend per week at your place. He didn't show any interest. Then I went to the parking attendant to ask for help and he said to me I could be lying that I never received the ticket in the first place. I asked him explained to me and he refuse to and asked me to call European Car Park. I rang the place up and all they said to me were there is nothing they can do. I feel very vulnerable now as I really don't know what to do. Can you please help me with this issue as I'm flying out tomorrow and not come back for 2 weeks. Thanks;2016-08-05T08:12:27+0000;0

Sorry you had a frustrating experience in our Nairn store. The colleague, however, is correct in saying that it is illegal. The term ""alcohol-free"" can be applied to products which contain less than 1% alcohol but because there's still alcoholic content - albeit a tiny amount - sale to anyone under 18 is prohibited, in keeping with UK licensing laws.

I am not  a clone - you do not know me or my long term interest in such matters so do not judge so quickly or respond to something not addressed to you so sharply. I will leave Maria from Sainsbury's to respond in more detail - all she makes mention of in the Basics range is the slightly smaller parsnips- hardly the wonky, mis-shapen ones or particularly wide-ranging which is the point I was trying to get over. I have no idea of your history or the cause of your antipathy in such matters but as this is something I was taking up with Sainsbury's and your input is merely rude and ill-mannered I would thank you to refrain from entering this thread again.;2016-08-04T17:07:09+0000;0

I do not believe that customers really care very much if a carrot is not arrow straight - they just want fresh fruit and vegetables at reasonable prices.   I am only an occasional Sainsbury s shopper  but I may consider shopping there more often if you stopped the tonnes of waste caused by your requirements  which I consider immoral.   No housewife during WW11 cared what shape fruit and vegetables were - she was just so grateful to be able to buy any!;2016-08-03T17:11:31+0000;10155074249789377_10155074378579377;pageowner;0;Hi Lesley, we use produce of all of shapes and sizes.

Rang up when I got home and spoke to a lovely employee who contacted the store only to be told no one was there to deal with it and that they didn t know which delivery driver it was and that someone from the store would call me first thing this morning  they didn t. Called this morning again for another lovely employee to contact the store to be told they had been left a note but didn t know what it was and that all drivers were busy today but there MIGHT be one between 2-3 which I said was not acceptable as I am out for the day and these items should have been priority. I was obviously unhappy about this and the lady went back to the store and explained this wasn t acceptable as I placed an order to be delivered at a certain time  it has all been paid for (yesterday the money has been taken from my account) and it is not my fault that 16 items have not been delivered. They then said they have a driver around 5:30 - 6:30 this evening and will call me once they ve contacted the driver (still waiting for a call) Both the ladies at the call centre were very apologetic and helpful but the way this is being dealt with by the store is shocking.

I had been at Flambards (the amusement park next door) all day and had popped in on my way home with my very tired three year old daughter and ten week old baby in tow. Not long into my shop  down the butter aisle  my daughter decided to throw the mother of all tantrums which she continued for the remainder of my shop; screaming  shouting  kicking  attempting to climb out of the trolley  actually managing to climb out of the trolley and running off... It was not an enjoyable visit to say the least! I was humbled by the support of other shoppers who could clearly see (and most definitely hear!) what my  darling  child was putting me through. Then one of your employees  Jonathan  approached me and offered his assistance. He offered to pick up any items I still required from the shop (I had already finished my shop though) and then took my trolley and pushed it towards the tills  where he then proceeded to open a till especially to serve me. Another member of staff  Ryan  helped him to load my shopping on to the conveyer belt and bag up my shopping. They also offered to help me out to the carpark to load the shopping into my car (I didn t take them up on this offer but in hindsight wished I had as I battled with strapping in two children while it poured down with rain!). I was so grateful for Jonathan and Ryan s help this afternoon and for being very patient and even trying to put a smile on my daughter s face at the till (when she had calmed down a tiny bit).

It was not an enjoyable visit to say the least! I was humbled by the support of other shoppers who could clearly see (and most definitely hear!) what my  darling  child was putting me through. Then one of your employees  Jonathan  approached me and offered his assistance. He offered to pick up any items I still required from the shop (I had already finished my shop though) and then took my trolley and pushed it towards the tills  where he then proceeded to open a till especially to serve me. Another member of staff  Ryan  helped him to load my shopping on to the conveyer belt and bag up my shopping. They also offered to help me out to the carpark to load the shopping into my car (I didn t take them up on this offer but in hindsight wished I had as I battled with strapping in two children while it poured down with rain!). I was so grateful for Jonathan and Ryan s help this afternoon and for being very patient and even trying to put a smile on my daughter s face at the till (when she had calmed down a tiny bit).

Then one of your employees  Jonathan  approached me and offered his assistance. He offered to pick up any items I still required from the shop (I had already finished my shop though) and then took my trolley and pushed it towards the tills  where he then proceeded to open a till especially to serve me. Another member of staff  Ryan  helped him to load my shopping on to the conveyer belt and bag up my shopping. They also offered to help me out to the carpark to load the shopping into my car (I didn t take them up on this offer but in hindsight wished I had as I battled with strapping in two children while it poured down with rain!). I was so grateful for Jonathan and Ryan s help this afternoon and for being very patient and even trying to put a smile on my daughter s face at the till (when she had calmed down a tiny bit).

I'm a busy working mum with two young children and a fisherman husband who does not work a 9-5 working day, I'm responsible for ensuring the fridge and cupboards have food in as I'm sure you'll appreciate he cannot access a shop when he's at sea! Being the summer holidays we've had lots going on with friends and family so naturally the weekly food shop has not been at the top of my to-do list, hence nipping in to sainsburys on my way home to grab a couple of bits to see us until I could do a proper shop.

Secondly, she probably was tired but she was happy enough on arrival at the shop and actually wanted to go in as she wanted to get some stickers for her sticker book at home. Thirdly, it's nice to hear of your empathy and I'm sure your children were angels every minute of every day. Fourthly, if I didn't need to go shopping, believe me I would not have done. I always try to do any shopping while my daughter is at nursery if possible in between my own work schedule, but with a fisherman husband who works away a lot, or does long days leaving at 4.30am and not getting home until 8pm when he's working out of our home port, I'm sure you can understand that there will always be occasions when I have no choice but to take the children with me. On this particular day I was at a theme park right next to the shop, I had to pick up a couple of bits to ensure there was food to send my husband off to sea with the next day (and I'm sure you're aware that there are no shops out at sea for him to grab food from), the logical thing to do was to nip in on my way home, it was around 3pm and like I said I only needed a handful of items. If I did not take the chance then to do a quick shop chances are I would not have made it to a shop until at least 9pm by which time I'm normally ready for bed myself. Excuse me for having a busy life; I'm a working mum with two young children and a husband who does not have a 9-5 job, and I'm most glad to hear you no longer work in retail - with an attitude like yours what a blessing that is to shoppers all over! Now if you can't say anything nice, there's no need to say anything at all 👍🏻";2016-08-03T19:58:38+0000;55

Well done! The exact opposite happened to me in a local supermarket in the Isle of Man, I had picked up a ready bagged bag of potatoes at a reduced price, along with the rest of my shopping, when I got through the checkout, the bottom of the bag gave way and there were potatoes all over the place, the girl at the till just stared and said nothing, she didn't even offer a new bag to put them in. I picked them up and she impatiently repeated how much I owed, I paid with my debit card... The card machine said thank you, I pointed out to her that even the machines were more polite than the humans serving, absolutely no response. It makes you wonder what these youngsters are taught!

It was not an enjoyable visit to say the least! I was humbled by the support of other shoppers who could clearly see (and most definitely hear!) what my  darling  child was putting me through. Then one of your employees  Jonathan  approached me and offered his assistance. He offered to pick up any items I still required from the shop (I had already finished my shop though) and then took my trolley and pushed it towards the tills  where he then proceeded to open a till especially to serve me. Another member of staff  Ryan  helped him to load my shopping on to the conveyer belt and bag up my shopping. They also offered to help me out to the carpark to load the shopping into my car (I didn t take them up on this offer but in hindsight wished I had as I battled with strapping in two children while it poured down with rain!). I was so grateful for Jonathan and Ryan s help this afternoon and for being very patient and even trying to put a smile on my daughter s face at the till (when she had calmed down a tiny bit).

I had been at Flambards (the amusement park next door) all day and had popped in on my way home with my very tired three year old daughter and ten week old baby in tow. Not long into my shop  down the butter aisle  my daughter decided to throw the mother of all tantrums which she continued for the remainder of my shop; screaming  shouting  kicking  attempting to climb out of the trolley  actually managing to climb out of the trolley and running off... It was not an enjoyable visit to say the least! I was humbled by the support of other shoppers who could clearly see (and most definitely hear!) what my  darling  child was putting me through. Then one of your employees  Jonathan  approached me and offered his assistance. He offered to pick up any items I still required from the shop (I had already finished my shop though) and then took my trolley and pushed it towards the tills  where he then proceeded to open a till especially to serve me. Another member of staff  Ryan  helped him to load my shopping on to the conveyer belt and bag up my shopping. They also offered to help me out to the carpark to load the shopping into my car (I didn t take them up on this offer but in hindsight wished I had as I battled with strapping in two children while it poured down with rain!). I was so grateful for Jonathan and Ryan s help this afternoon and for being very patient and even trying to put a smile on my daughter s face at the till (when she had calmed down a tiny bit). Despite the drama  I left the store feeling very humbled by the majority of people in it and especially the kindness of your two very helpful employees Jonathan and Ryan who made such a difference for me today!";2016-08-02T19:58:20+0000;10155071419214377_10155078046719377;ae753f0a4e5bcb51eeec74d3d00ae67947f7b542;0;Wow you don't get service like that any more well done lads x;2016-08-04T20:13:26+0000;3

Just snapping because you don't feel that shop staff should 'have' to stop their actual job to go help a customer is seemingly a bit daft. What those boys choose to do, as she clearly didn't ask them, was firstly their choice and secondly was providing customer service which is part of every shop workers role. Not all staff would have gone to that extreme for somebody but these lads did and that deserves a pat on the back. As a shop manager in the past it was gratifying to hear people say nice things about my staff and I always made a point of sharing it with them and the rest of the shop. People are quick to complain about staff but not so quick to compliment.  So maybe if you had just worded your opinion a little differently to maybe, it's unfair to give everyone the expectation they should all recieve this treatment when a lot us us shop workers are already doing too much as it is, might not have caused so many people to become irate with you.

Anyone posting negative comments please think before you write comments like this as there could be an underlying problem. I had the same problem with my son. I could never understand it until at the age of 7 he was diagnosed with Aspergers and all became clear. I used to wonder why people couldn't control their kids (don't get me wrong there are kids who throw tantrums when they don't get what they want) but without knowing anything about the child no one should make any judgement. It's bad enough with trying to control a situation without people glaring at you and even worse on more than one occasion being told what an awful mother I was and should perhaps attend parenting classes!;2016-08-07T17:37:47+0000;1

Its almost like something has gone wrong in storage.  Even the Walkers crisps I bought last week seemed ""softer"" than normal. If I list it all, Im going to look so bad.  Its silly things like the Finest Chilli and rice (chilled) says cook for 20 mins at gas mark 5..its barely warm at that. Your own thin base ham and pineapple pizza (chilled) says 8-10 mins, the reality is nearly 20 mins. We have always had your own chilled thin and crispy pepperoni pizza and the last two times my other half has had severe stomach pain after. Your own Angel cake with still a week on the date had a definite off taste to it. Its not a recent thing either. Last year I had exactly the same issue with bread not lasting and complained on more than one occasion. It is getting worse;2016-08-02T19:56:32+0000;0

I have to say I found the whole experience like pulling teeth!

I was looking at getting a baby sleep bag  which had a sticker for half price. There was another design which was also Half price but not the size I wanted. There were 2 of each design right at the back. When I took it to the till it came out full price. When I questioned this I was told people have been going round putting the stickers on  and its a new line. Why if you have a new line only have 2 and have them right at the back. I have seen that design in store for months. I asked to see a manager but I was passed to someone who works in the clothing department who just looked on the system and said its full price  and she can not sell it for half price. My question is that it has been advertised at half price you should really honour this  as it is misleading. My opinion to stop this happening again and for people moving the stickers for half price is that you change your system so this confusion does not happen again. But why would someone put a sticker for half price on an item and put it back if they didn t want it.  I was not happy with the way I was spoken to and left the store  without any compromise on the item I wanted to buy which was advertised as half price.;2016-08-02T16:25:41+0000;10155070893504377_10155070907889377;pageowner;0;Really sorry about this Nicole. The price that the item scans through as is the correct price, unfortunately if there was a mistake with the sticker the store wouldn't usually be able to honour this, but I'll certainly log your feedback about it being unclear.

You got that one right on so many different levels. From the loving relationships with his mum and big sister to the idea that he goes to main stream school. Just like any other kid. You touched on such simple hopes and aspirations a parent can have for their child who has Down syndrome.

Now supposing they decided to DOUBLE UP the price to TWO PENCE EACH, the total for 180 of these items would then be £3.60 so no, it does NOT answer my question whatsoever and I'm now starting to wonder whether to bother shopping online with Sainsburys ever again.;2016-08-02T16:19:38+0000;0

I regularly use this store to pick up a few bits. I went to use the self check out and was attempting to buy a cold and flu syrup. A new member of staff who must have only been about 18 asked me for proof that I was 16 years old +. I dug around in my bag and found my Postgraduate university identity card with my picture on which clearly states I m a postgraduate student and also showed my NUS card again with my photo and my date of birth. Despite this he refused to sell me the flu syrup and seemed to find the whole thing incredibly funny at my expense.
