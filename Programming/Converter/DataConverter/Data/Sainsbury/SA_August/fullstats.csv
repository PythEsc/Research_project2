I was riding my motorbike home and halfway through the ride realised that my rear lights had failed. It was getting dark and I was worried about not being seen. I decided to stop at your Badshot Lea store in the hope of finding a cycle light or something as a temporary fix. I asked one of your assistants for some help and they could not have been more helpful. He took time to help me look at a few options  none of which were any good sadly. This lovely gentleman then told me to wait and he would see what was upstairs. He came back with his OWN cycle light for me to use. I made it home in one piece thanks to my kindly donated DIY tail light.   I was so grateful to that man and all his help. He is a credit to your business and you should be proud of your colleagues for going that extra mile.;;;;;2016-08-31T20:32:15+0000;1472675535;2016-08-31 22:32:15;4;7;4;0;11;7;1;6;2;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Let me paint the picture.....  Imagine if you will that you are a 30 year old woman (that s me  by the way) recently heartbroken  on her way to spend the afternoon with your very pregnant bestie. You have told her you are going to take round some tasty treats and soul food....and for the purposes of clarity  by soul food  what I actually mean is cake.   You stop off at your local Sainsbury s store (Barnwood in Gloucester) on the hunt for nomaliscious squidgy  sweet  chocolately  cakey deliciousness and make a beeline for the patisserie counter.   Now  as I m sure you are fully immersed in your current role (female  30  heartbroken craving cake  delivering to very pregnant friend) I m sure I don t need to tell you the importance of making the right decision at the patisserie counter.  Everything rests on this. The wrong cake and the afternoon could descend into a hormonal blub fest. You re also more than a little bit skint  so splurging on fancy cakes is a HUGE treat.   You choose a couple of safe bets: jam doughnut  cream eclair... But then.... your eyes alight on a thing of beauty! The label describes it as a millionaires tart. You lick your lips  thinking of a dense chocolate ganache on top of a smooth caramel  encased in crisp buttery pastry case. It is the last one left  it s as if it was meant for you!   You race to your friend s house (at a responsible speed  in line with the rules and regulations of the Highway Code)  barely able to contain your excitement. In her kitchen  you cut the tart into shareable portions  salivating as the hidden caramel oozes out...your friend looks over your shoulder and exclaims  WHAT is that?! It looks AMAZING  I can t wait to try it!   On the sofa  binge watching Say Yes To The Dress with the plate of cakes between you  you save the best til last- opting for eclair and doughnut first - you are the first to try the tart  you lick a little bit of the caramel from your finger ...so so  and take a big bite into the chocolatey filling aaaaand:   IT S DISGUSTING.   No  really. It s a big giant let down...just like every man... (Whoops  not integral to the story...moving on)   You look at your friend with eyes filled with disappointment and sadness. She also takes a bite.   BFF: ugh! *pulls tart away from mouth  then begins to do a visual inspection*  You: I know! Why is it so sweet?  BFF: it s like biting into a big gloop of icing sugar. You: *pulling a face* why isn t it ganache? Shouldn t it be ganache?  BFF: it SHOULD be ganache  You: do you think they just ran out in the bakery and decided to make do with the chocolate fondant they use for the eclairs?! BFF: that s EXACTLY what it tastes like.  You: Sainsbury s has let us down.   So there you have it. A tale of disappointment and woe. I hope this immersive experience has helped you to truly understand the extent to which poor product quality can impact upon a person s day. If you re going to have a  patisserie  counter  at least stock it with proper stuff  otherwise we might as well just go to Greggs.... even the NOTION! 😱  With great sadness  Emily-Rose (the heartbroken one) and Bethan (the pregnant one);;;;;2016-08-31T09:58:29+0000;1472637509;2016-08-31 11:58:29;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;6;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Once I got out to the car I opened pack and realised id ordered black tracksuit bottoms instead of blue. So went in to exchange. Walked back through store twice to check both areas where the uniform is kept. No blue bottoms. So went to customer service desk. Explained to lady on desk and asked if she possibly had any more out the back (I have recieved good service previously when asking staff to check out back). Her response was  i have no idea ! She then told me that I needed to walk back through the store (5th time in my visit) to find another member of staff to ask them. I did and managed to get them from stock room. Went back to desk to exchange. Straight forward or so I thought. No she informed me I would need to return first pair. Then buy second pair. And I wouldn t be refunded immediately as it was an online purchase. I told her I didn t understand and that I just wanted a straight swap just black to blue. She said it can t be done. (I d like to say that if I didn t have my receipt she wouldn t have even known that it wasn t purchased in store ) she was unable to explain why I couldn t just swap and why I had to pay again. Just kept saying thats the way its always been. Since shes worked there a year.Very bad attitude also was abrupt and short with me. At last she asked if I wanted a printed receipt or just to wait for an email. I said yes I d like a reciept please and she said of course you can no problem. But by the tone of her voice it obviously was a problem. I left the store very frustrated and quite angry. I d also like to add that I have worked in retail for ten years and where I work her  service  would be unnacceptable.;;;;;2016-08-30T17:51:12+0000;1472579472;2016-08-30 19:51:12;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Yes  I had removed the tags prior to going to iron them  which had me notice they were girls school trousers and not boys. When I purchased them they were among the boys clothing at the store  therefore had clearly been mixed up and I just grabbed the age required. I still had the tags and know items are sold without the tags as they put a code in instead  so then they told me if they took these trousers back then their store would lose money as these particular trousers are not sold in their store (now I don t mean to be rude  but that is ridiculous  there are numerous stores around the country with people exchanging/refunding)! So the fact they had no tags on them  but were there and that this store didn t sell these trousers meant I wasn t eligible for an exchange. Well like I said to them I will go and get the tags put back on and then instead of exchanging I will go to a different store that I ve never had a problem with exchanges or refunds in the past.  I have 3 boys  so definitely did not require girls school trousers and had purchased all their uniform in your store  but to exchange one set of trousers was a little too much. I even had PE shoes on hand to pay for too  safe to say I decided against buying them and will head to another shop instead.  You ll have the trousers back soon  once the tag is bag on.

Why is it that your taste the difference  97% pork sausages are now only available in a pack of 16  and not as a pack of 6? I don t have the freezer space for a bigger pack  nor do I want to spend £3.50 on a packed of sausages  when you were selling them for £2 before. Me thinks sainsbury are ripping us off a little. Esp as I ve noticed a lot of stores are now only stocking larger packs of everything  and putting the prices up. Getting a bit exasperated with you sainsbury and thinking a change of shop is in order. Explain please.

We called up to double check where it was to get a ride young man on the phone who was basically laughing at us  we were put through to another department who attempted to contact the branch but no one was answering  I then  quite simply asked the girl to explain why my children would not the able to have their breakfast in the morning  she tried to put it on us but we had called back as soon as we had the contact about their being an issue with the card (in honesty it was probably an old card initially as we do not often is this and were only using it because we got a £10 voucher). At this point it was getting late and I was not getting anywhere  feeling quite upset and stressed I asked the girl to get management to please call us in the morning to discuss this further but sadly  so far  no response. This has caused is considerable inconvenience as we had to pop to local shop for breakfast food (and give a disappointed three year old toast when we had promised bagels for breakfast) and I have now had to give up my morning to go to the supermarket.having a three year old and a one year as a working mum i use this service in good faith with the trust that I was paying to make my life a bit easier.

I have left very disappointed and surprised after a visit to your Weymouth store after s long day at work. Saturday 27th August I was looking forward to a hot pizza  freshly made in store. When I arrived and asked about gluten free options I was told its not possible to make a gf pizza but gf pizza bases were available on the shop floor.  My family had previously enjoyed pizzas from your Weymouth store as they do not have a wheat intolerance. I would have liked to have the convenience of a hot pizza made especially for my dietary needs as anyone who is vegan or vegetarian would.  I do not chose to eat a wheat free diet and feel penalized by the lack of tasty food to chose from. This is why I ask you to become the first supermarket to make gf bespoke pizzas as you normally would. I realise cross contamination I an issue but if major pizzerias are able to fulfill an exciting menu for gf then why not Sainsbury s? GF and wheat avoidance is a huge problem and big market. This is evident in trying to purchase bread and the shelves are empty from sales. I look forward to your thoughts and possibilities about taking this forward.;;;;;2016-08-27T20:11:58+0000;1472328718;2016-08-27 22:11:58;1;2;1;0;3;2;2;0;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

The first time I was asked to do this my son screamed the shop down and not one of your member of staff offered to help.  So today when I was asked I left my shopping and walked out as my son was started to get annoyed already. My partner contacted you the first time and nobody got back to us. As of now I shall started shopping elsewhere.

They immediately cancelled the card and gave him a number to call to get a new one.  Imagine the confusion of a deaf 85 year old man who was recently bereaved.   What is worse  the number they gave him was out of date and not working.  You really need to check on the training of your staff to make sure they  not only know what they re talking about but also do it in a more sensitive way.

Why do you have to add Wheat flour to dishes which traditionally don t use it - A Bhaji made properly is naturally gluten and wheat free.   Why have you changed it?  Very disappointing.

(I would like to point out this is not all the male staff members of this branch  as some are lovely  but some have been truly horrendous)   Dear Sir/ Madam   Living in Winnersh  in very close proximity to your store  I have shopped there my entire life. I have always been pleased with the service  but unfortunately the last few weeks  I have been hugely disappointed.  On multiple occasions recently I have been leered at  or made to feel hugely uncomfortable with comments in response to the way I m dressed or the way I look and sadly this has been from your staff. If these comments were mere compliments I would be flattered  but the tone in which they are spoken and the gestures that follow make it incredibly clear these are not just  compliments . In fact  I have felt vulnerable more than once in your store of late and it is making me wish there was another store I could use in the vicinity.  I urge you to please ensure your male staff members are respectful of women entering your store. As a young woman in summer I dress appropriately for the heat. I should not be spoken to inappropriately because I choose to wear a skirt. I have often seen men walk around topless in this store in the summer and not once have I seen them treated in this way. As a leading business I feel that Sainsbury s should be promoting equality and the safety of women. You may think a few comments  winks or hand gestures are nothing  however  a woman should not be made to feel insecure or unsafe during her weekly shop.  Yours sincerely   Tamsyn Armstrong;;;;;2016-08-25T20:59:12+0000;1472158752;2016-08-25 22:59:12;2;4;2;0;6;4;2;2;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Mike has asked me to respond on his behalf.   We have also been approached by campaigners for Changing Places  Space to Change toilets  as well as individuals who are seeking specific changes to our accessible toilets. It is important to us that we get it right for all our customers  which is why our accessible toilets working group is currently researching available options before deciding on our next steps. This includes working with the Centre for Accessible Environments and the Business Disability Forum  to develop our approach to both facilities and signage for all customers.   We have also taken on board the need to demonstrate more clearly that people with non-visible conditions are very welcome to use our accessible toilets  or ask for help in our stores.  We are going to think about how we can do this better  and are currently discussing this internally.     We take our responsibilities to customers who have non visible disabilities very seriously.  An example of this is training  which all of our stores undertook this July  on how to give great service to customers with non visible disabilities  including autism  deafness  dementia and mental health conditions. We have plans to build on this  so that we can ensure that all customers  including customers with non visible disabilities  have a great experience in all our stores.   I am grateful to you for taking the time to contact us  allowing us the opportunity to address your concerns.

I ordered 18  75cl bottles of prosecco (to get the 25% off deal) along with a few groceries (so that I could also use my £18 off a £60 first online delivery code).  Delivery man arrives. With 4  75cl bottles and 14  37.5cl bottles. Yes  I m sure the prosecco was the highest priced one you do  but I had half the volume and in my case  I do not want quality over quantity. Delivery man couldn t understand why I wouldn t accept the delivery and stropped off.   How the heck would anyone think an acceptable substitute would be to send half the volume of something???

Your Twitter team seem to have lost all ability to communicate  and I m not sure who has taken over your call centre but the 5 people I ve spoken to today have been pretty average to be fair  none of them sounded like the kind of people dressed head to toe in orange and beaming from ear to ear. One of them even cut me off. Another said  you can speak to a manager if you want but they ll only tell you the same as me   and I was promised a manager call back within 30 minutes  which is reasonably efficient. Unfortunately that was over an hour ago  and in the words of Diana Ross   I m still waiting.    The problem is with your fabulous offer which I gather is meant to attract new online customers  you know the one where you spend £60 or more and get £18 off? Ever the savvy shopper  I signed up tout suite and filled my basket with delicious goodies. I even read the T&Cs very carefully  which state  When using a promotional money off voucher the value of the goods other than spirits  liqueurs or wine when on any buy 6 save 25% multibuy must be at least equal to the money off offered by the promotional voucher.    Soooooo... The voucher offers £18 off  and the T&Cs say that at least that amount has to be made up of goods that are not spirits  liqueurs or wine  right? Of my basket which came to £68  over £30 of it isn t alcohol. Perfect!  Not perfect. The voucher code wasn t accepted  so I called  customer services  (I ve used apostrophes as the service was pretty non existent so I don t want anyone to do me under the Trades Descriptions Act). The man told me I had to spend £60 to qualify and that none of it could be alcohol. It doesn t say that anywhere!  I called again later and spoke to someone else  who told me he couldn t look at the order until I paid for it. He assured me that if I paid for it we could sort everything.  I paid for it. Then he cut me off whoooops.  I called back. The lady told me her colleague was correct and that I d not spent enough  and if I wanted to speak to someone in  customer care  that she could put me through. (Again  apostrophes re potential incorrect use of the word  care  - goodness me  this legal stuff is a nightmare  someone should write some T&Cs to clear things up.)  Then I spoke to Niamh in customer care! But she didn t care. She said I could speak to the manager but that he would only tell me the same thing. She also told me I needed to spend £6 more on non alcohol  and that if I took the vodka off the order and added a £6 steak that it would go through fine.   Stupid me! I did not know you sold a steak for £6 that could get me as drunk as a bottle of Russia s finest. Does it taste as good with lime and lemonade?  Anyway. The manager call was promised at 7.30pm by Niamh. She said all the managers were too busy to speak to me. She told me it would be within half an hour. That was 1.5 hours ago.   Oh  and she also told me that she understood exactly what the T&Cs meant. As if that meant it was OK for this new condition to just be an unsaid rule  a bit like a dirty secret.   I have to go now because it s the last in the series of Long Lost Family in a minute  and to be frank I m not even sure that one of Nicky Campbell s  specialist adoption intermediaries  could get me any further with you lot tonight.   What I will say is that if my order arrives on Friday without this being sorted (and/or with steak instead of vodka) I will look forward to our next set of correspondence with great delight!;;;;;2016-08-24T19:54:57+0000;1472068497;2016-08-24 21:54:57;4;9;7;1;17;9;4;5;5;0;4;0;0;3;0;0;0

Finding foods - particularly lunches and ready meals - without cheese or fromage frais and the like - is quite hard.   Chinese and Asian dishes are usually great because those traditions don t use dairy.  So I am deeply disappointed that Sainsburys have introduced soft cheese to fish sushi (completely inauthentic) which takes away that lunch option for a reasonably large cohort of the community.  Presumably it is a cheap filler?;;;;;2016-08-23T07:18:59+0000;1471936739;2016-08-23 09:18:59;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

It should have been a behind-the-scenes transfer  seamless as far as customers are concerned. However  what we actually have from the customers  point of view is an in-store pharmacy that is  out of stock  of many everyday over the counter items  with no prospect of serving customers  needs until Lloyds takes over  which isn t for a couple of weeks. From my observations  this is business wide  rather than individual stores. So far  I have seen identical scenarios in 2 different stores  a pharmacy with empty shelves and diminishing stock.    If this extends to prescriptions  this could cause problems for patients who need their prescriptions filled when issued  not in 2 weeks time.;;;;;2016-08-22T20:57:44+0000;1471899464;2016-08-22 22:57:44;0;5;0;0;5;5;1;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Every day in fact  as i live above it! I ve checked my bank transactions and between my partner and I we have spent over 3 grand there since January  so what follows came as a shock. As i live directly above your shop (My apartment is situated directly above sainsburys)  I park in the private car park belonging to the apartment complex. Unfortunately  my FOB had broke  and in desperate need of somewhere to park my car  I used the two spaces located next to the private bay. These are signed as  Visitors bays  for commodore court in our communal area  so i had thought it would be okay to leave it here  on a Sunday  whilst I arranged for a new FOB. you can imagine my shock when i returned only two hours later to find a parking charge on my car (in the perceived  visitors area )  especially given the fact i shop at sainsburys everyday and i had parked there previously without issue when FOB issues had arisen in the past.   I understand the need for deterrents when it comes to people misusing the car park  but here are the issues with this application :  1) I use sainsburys on a daily basis and live literally directly above it.  2) I was in no way hindering the use of the customer car park (i parked in two unmarked bays directly adjacent to the marked bay car park) 3) This was an unfortunate circumstance in which i was unable to gain access to the private car park for tennants use 4) There is signage in the communal area to the effect of these two bays being private and for visitors of the complex).   So you can understand my confusion and disappointment  especially when i wanted to talk to the store manager  but being told  we dont deal with the parking  sorry . As i mentioned before  my girlfriend and I used sainsburys on a daily basis  so this doesnt seem right that we are penalised for using what appears to be visitors parking bays for the Commodore Court complex. If this cannot be resolved  we will take our grocery needs elsewhere  as we have shopped at sainsburys everyday for over a year  and wouldnt want to give more money to you if you are unable to see the situation fairly.   I would appreciate if someone could contact me to discuss  as this has caused considerable stress  and would prefer an amicable solution instead of taking our business elsewhere.

After buying a 32  LG television in September 2012  they item  through a manufacturing defect has stopped working. Under the sales of goods act (as it was purchased before 1st October 2015)  as a consumer  I am entitled to a repair or a replacement  of which Sainsbury s  Internal  team have denied and after spending £35 on an engineers report to show the fault  as per Sainsbury s request  they are now willing to reimburse the fee and give £46 towards the repair even though the repair is £134.52 + the initial £35 for the fee.  Sadly  Sainsbury s  this isn t how consumer law works and I will be making Trading Standards aware that you are restricting consumer rights as well as the consumer ombudsman  and will be putting this message across various social media platforms for potential customers to see so that they don t get stung in the same way like I did.  I d advise anyone looking to buy a television to shop elsewhere  including Richer Sounds who actually honour warranties and consumer law.  Sainsbury s  you can expect to hear from small claims court  of which you will be liable for all costs brought forward  meaning that this will cost you a lot more than simply just replacing the television as you should under consumer law.

I live in Dunfermline and make the 10 mile trip to sainsbury once a month. I had done my shopping then remembered I had a girls top to return as my daughter received it for her birthday and didn t like it. I had said to her we could change it and buy something she would like. We stood at the empty customer service desk for a minute then an assistant came  went straight to the announcement microphone and called for help on the cash desks  made no eye contact and left! 2 other members of staff walked by and saw me  then two other customers joined my queue. About a minute later 3 ladies walked down together with clothes in their hands and one shouted  I ll be there in a minute!   She never came back. 30 seconds later the first assistant (who ignored me) came onto the desk  I tried to return the top  it had the plastic tag but no label on and Tu on the label. Also had the hanger. She said she couldn t do anything to help me! Previous shops  Asda  boots  Tesco have always excepted returns. I left her with the top as what else could I do with it? My daughter wouldn t wear it. I would have probably spent more money getting something she liked if she had been more helpful. Just wanted to let you know  been shopping there for past 8 years  this has made me rethink.;;;;;2016-08-21T11:57:49+0000;1471780669;2016-08-21 13:57:49;1;4;1;0;5;4;3;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I just thought if that was my mum I d would like to think that someone would ask if she was alright! So I walked over  blocking some ignorant shoppers offered to take her trolley to the car and off load her shopping  the lady cried as she said that she often struggles and she gets so frustrated with herself. She had an adapted car so could drive home and promised me she would ask her neighbour for help to put the shopping away. Where has respect and common decency for others gone! Shame on the Sainsbury s staff  one who looked at me with disgust as I offered to help! I believe in  paying it forward  it took no time or effort to help this person  but meant a great deal to her.

Where I used to live in Congleton  Cheshire the supermarkets were Aldi & Tesco & Morrison s.  Morrison s was great - all the trolleys are doubles.  Tesco is awesome.  I pull into a mother & child space & there are a selection of trolleys right there.  I now find myself having to drive almost 30 minutes to the nearest Tesco in Telford or shopping online with Tesco.   I would love to try Sainsbury s  but it seems there is a strict limit to how many children are allowed in store at any one time?!?   Move over Challenge 25  Sainsbury s have Challenge children.   I accept I may never get one of the three mother & child spaces (I also stopped playing the lottery)  that s okay  I m small enough to help my kids squeeze in & out of the car doors  but once that challenge is complete I then find myself unable to shop because there is never a trolley!  I m informed by the very helpful  trolley man  that there are two double trolleys.  Two!!!!!  So only two mothers/families with more than one young child can shop at a time.  Iv e only been here a few weeks  but Bridgnorth appears to have an average number of children!   I have twins as do many other women & many more have two or more young children.   I accept you policy  but is there a possibility of introducing a rota system for the trolleys  so I can book one in advance?  Maybe a barrier with a guard to check the number of children in the car before allowing entry to the car-park would save the disappointment of parking & squeezing out of the car only to get straight back in to drive to Tesco.  Maybe just a blanket ban on people carriers?  A member of staff on the door to confiscate the extra child/children & issue a receipt for their return at checkout  subject to a minimum £40 spend of course.  Free condoms provided to shoppers who already have one child? Although that would take a few years to have an effect.    Please help!  There must be a solution so that the people of Bridgnorth who have more than one child can shop with you. Maybe something really simple & obvious that I ve missed!?!;;;;;2016-08-19T13:16:00+0000;1471612560;2016-08-19 15:16:00;6;3;6;0;9;3;2;1;2;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;0

As it was so hot I felt something light and maybe fishlike was on the cards. Imagine my delight when I found some taste the difference  smoked haddock rarebit filo tartlets  staring up at me. Perfect with some new potatoes and a bit of salad for a bit of al fresco dining. I returned home and put them straight in the oven. They soon smelt delightful and looked even better.  Can you now imagine my utter disappointment when my husband asked if it was supposed to be fish as he didn t have any in his (I was about to start mine as I had been saving the best until last). I thought maybe it was mixed in with the sauce but low and behold a flake of haddock did appear. I then started mine and was even more upset that my husband had manage to get the one with the most fish in it. I didn t even have a flake in mine. Now for a product which is supposedly a luxury range I would have thought I may get a few chunks of haddock in them  especially when the description on the box reads  filled with smoked haddock . I must say the filo was lovely and crispy and the copious amount of sauce was very tasty  it would have been nicer still with some flesh of an ugly sea dweller.  Had I not been so tired and hungry I would have retuned them but instead I just ate the saucy pastry and my two hounds enjoyed my husbands. I didn t take a photo either as I couldn t be bothered to fetch my phone.  I think its fair to say that I was punished for being lazy tonight  I know Saint Jamie of  processed food damnation will relish at the thought of another person being forced to cook instead of taking the easy way out. So could you please either start putting some haddock (to be honest you could stick any fish in there but please stay away from the sea horses) or label them as something more appropriate like Fish surprize  or magical haddock.

My mother only had a few items and therefore used the self service tills. She clicked the option for a 5p carrier bag.  After she had paid for her shopping she didn t know where the bags were kept so she asked the sales assistant. To which the lady abruptly (and rudely) replied  well you ll have to pay for that . My mother answered that she had already paid for one and was just asking where they were. To which the assistant snatched the receipt from the machine to check  before thrusting it upon my mother barking  here s your receipt   she made my mother feel like a liar and a criminal.  I understand that since the 5p charge has come into effect that your staff receive a lot of abuse. However this was completely uncalled for and down right rude.

I ve just wasted ten minutes of my lunchtime searching a) for a car park payment machine that was working and b) searching for a car park payment machine that was directed to by a  Pay At Meter  sign. Neither of which existed today. Might have been an idea to put signs on the meters saying none of them were working. This would have helped several other people wandering around searching for things that didn t exist. And if that wasn t bad enough when I needed authorisation at the self service checkout  the assistant standing not 10 feet (yes  less than 10 feet) away from me was looking in every direction bar the one she should have been. Those tills are not exactly quiet. A quick ten minute shop turned into half an hour of pain.

I generally shop of an evening as I work and find evenings quieter  which generally means this is a quicker experience.  This evening  the whole experience took over 2 hours and I have been banned from using the store by the Duty Manager and was unable to purchase my shopping.   I purchased a large shop and was at the check out when a customer in front spoke with me and I replied to the customer with a comment regarding a dog.  At this very point  the cashier says  I m calling my Manager as you have a dog in your bag .  My first thoughts were that the cashier was not very bright and mildly entertaining as there was no reason to believe this to be the case.  I then realise that the cashier was serious and makes several phone calls whilst I am left standing at the check out.  I ask her to stop wasting time and  stop being a jobs worth  she then comments   I have to tell my Manager .  After around 15 minutes I was so fed up with the nonsense that I walked out of the store and left my bag in the car.  On my return  the Manageress appears.  I explain that I am unimpressed by this behavior of being accused of having a dog in my bag when the Manageress says  I have been rude to her staff and she will not serve me in her store   I am outraged at this stupidity and I am told by the Manageress that I said   her staff was a  jobs-worth . As a busy person who does my shopping at this store every week and spend somewhere in the region of £650 per month  I am appalled at the accusations I have been accused of  not to mention the time wasting.   Having read in the news last week that Sainsbury s had an incident with a gay customer kissing  I am wondering whether their staff are secretly sabotaging their business.   I felt it necessary to let other customers know of this crazy experience  which incidentally was witnessed by many  one of which has given me his details as he suggested I approach the local newspaper with this crazy story.   I will of course approach them tomorrow along with the Independent who was happy to print the story of the gay couple.   Sainsbury s  if you care to see the colour of my money again I expect an apology from the staff which behaved appalling this evening and wasted several hours of my valuable time  and off course more time tomorrow shopping at Waitrose  where I am only ever treated with such great customer service.;;;;;2016-08-17T23:39:34+0000;1471477174;2016-08-18 01:39:34;4;74;6;2;82;73;28;45;143;0;4;0;2;0;0;0;0

This store has not had it in and every day I m giving an excuse of stock issues? As if it s my issue. Every day I was told it s showing as in stock but they can t find it? My response well order more  surely that s common sense? I was then lied to on several occasions that stock was ordered and will be in the next day... Not true! I then spoke to someone on the 15th of August who explained that yes it s showing as in stock but that stock has went missing and no one has changed it to nil on the system which is why new stock wasn t automatically ordered... This has taken me 2 weeks to find this out! As this is my only local store who stocks this milk I don t find this acceptable!

Seriously thinking of changing to another supermarket website that is easier to use!!!  Aug. 11th - Why do you make unnecessary changes to the groceries website that make the user experience worse? I have been doing online shopping with you for over 9 years and during all that time I have had my Favourites as a Single List. Within that single list  all items have been grouped into categories such as fresh produce  dairy  meat  drinks  food cupboard  household etc  generally following the layout of a store. Now two weeks ago you have implemented an update and my single list of favourite items are now just listed in alphabetical order. So for example  different types of cold meat  pates  etc are listed by the brand or store name and no longer grouped together. Even different sizes of Sainsburys brand of milk cartons are no longer listed together because of the size difference of 1 pint  2 pint and 4 pint. Whereas previously  I could see at a glance everything in a category everything is now muddled and instead of just clicking through 9 pages in 10 minutes  my orders are taking nearer 30 minutes to complete because I m having to check that I haven t missed anything. If I go to Favourites by Aisle  I then have to click on each aisle listing to then find a product which is very time-consuming and not as quick as the old layout. I might as well just go through each category of the food groceries and I feel this change makes a nonsense of having Favourites. Why did you have to change the layout of the Favourites as a single list. It was so easy and quick which is what online shopping is meant to be about  not having to check and recheck my trolley to make sure I haven t missed anything. I phoned the online shopping line today to complain but of course  no-one can say why this has happened and of course  we are now stuck with a stupid useless list.  Do these people who implement these updates actually use the website each week and understand how consumers actually use the website  no  someone comes up with some silly idea and thinks its an  improvement ! If you can implements  updates  then please reinstate the groupings within the Favourites as a Single list. I m sure its not that difficult. And will anyone actually take any notice of my post or will it just be ignored. Has anyone else noticed the change and are they as frustrated as me?;;;;;2016-08-16T20:09:46+0000;1471378186;2016-08-16 22:09:46;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I mentioned this on leaving the store to the checkout manager and asked that my feed back got back to him. Saying it is a hard job working with the public but this young lad had got it right! Twice I have been in the store since and asked him if he had been spoken to and he has not! I have asked again that could my comments be passed on to mangers. Surley this sort of feed back is as important if not more so than complaints? I find it awful that no positive feed back has got back to this young man! I would like to think it now will!;;;;;2016-08-16T16:27:41+0000;1471364861;2016-08-16 18:27:41;2;3;2;0;5;3;1;2;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

When pulling up to the pump I witnessed an elderly lady get covered in petrol from a pump that was clearly leaking. My partner went into pay and witnessed the lady that was covered in petrol telling the member of staff who was in there early - mid twenties what has happened. The member of staff instantly responded that the pump wasn t leaking and no he isn t going to look at the pump as he has already checked this out once today (which would suggest a problem anyway)  My partner overheard this and said to the colleague it s defiantly leaking I seen the pump cover the lady in petrol at this point the staff member laughed and just continued with the transaction.  I can t believe that this is the customer service that is given or that this is the way your staff talk to customers especially elderly ones.

Why I asked. Health and Safety was the reply! Given you don t seem to supply wine carriers this seems a lttle odd! Other supermarkets and indeed some sainsburys do this. Rather intrigued as to what wine box related  incidents have led to this strange outcome. Granted I could cut myself  fall over it or indeed get my head stuck in it! All very unlikely and I am possibly more likely to walk into a trolley  fall over a basket or bump into a human. Can I kindly suggest that in the spirit of consistency and my welfare that these are removed from the store as well?

It s also happened with a pack of chicken breast that we ordered once  it arrived and we only had ONE day to eat it until the eat before date arrived.

I have been doing online shopping with you for over 9 years and during all that time I have had my Favourites as a Single List. Within that single list  all items have been grouped into categories such as fresh produce  dairy  meat  drinks  food cupboard  household etc  generally following the layout of a store. Now two weeks ago you have implemented an update and my single list of favourite items are now just listed in alphabetical order. So for example  different types of cold meat  pates  etc are listed by the brand or store name and no longer grouped together. Even different sizes of Sainsburys brand of milk cartons are no longer listed together because of the size difference of 1 pint  2 pint and 4 pint. Whereas previously  I could see at a glance everything in a category everything is now muddled and instead of just clicking through 9 pages in 10 minutes  my orders are taking nearer 30 minutes to complete because I m having to check  that I haven t missed anything. If I go to Favourites by Aisle  I then have to click on each aisle listing to then find a product which is very time-consuming and not as quick as the old layout. I might as well just go through each category of the food groceries and I feel this change makes a nonsense of having Favourites. Why did you have to change the layout of the Favourites as a single list. It was so easy and quick which is what online shopping is meant to be about  not having to check and recheck my trolley to make sure I haven t missed anything. I phoned the online shopping line today to complain but of course  no-one can say why this has happened and of course  we are now stuck with a stupid useless list.  Do these people who implement these updates actually use the website each week and understand how consumers actually use the website  no  someone comes up with some silly idea and thinks its an  improvement ! If you can implements  updates  then please reinstate the groupings within the Favourites as a Single list. I m sure its not that difficult. And will anyone actually take any notice of my post or will it just be ignored. Has anyone else noticed the change and are they as frustrated as me?;;;;;2016-08-11T21:02:38+0000;1470949358;2016-08-11 23:02:38;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

They also forced they way inti my car and stole my keys along with my home keys leaving me shocked and stranded. When I threatened them with the police they simply walked away and told me to do so - clearly a helpful lot and a cut above the law. Glad to say that Surrey Police did recover my stolen items. I would like to thank all those that have not shopped in the past week at Sainsbury s in Knaphill  Surrey. I would like to thank all those that also did not shop at other Sainsbury s and also those that reduced their shopping by at least a single item. I also understand that more of you will be doing so upon your return. Also if you are looking at insurance  travel  credit card etc... do not consider Sainsbury s. I certainly  Tasted The Difference  last week and would not wish that upon my enemies with no consideration for the disabled nor children or people s property or just people.

I ve been asked this now for nearly a week following my latest experience with Sainsbury s where I along with my son were subjected to verbal abuse and having my car keys stolen along with my house keys and other important items. It certainly is stressing. It certainly was a shock. It is also being stranded and its certainly is being a victim. However. the best definition for  Taste the Difference  has to be in that magical word  Difference . Whilst the retail industry is constantly fight losses due to shop lifting by employing security and relying on the powers of the law for convictions  the  Taste the Difference  is the complete opposite. This is where an innocent disabled person  along with their family  is subjected not only to verbal abuse  but having Sainsbury s break into their car and steal property  leaving the customer in a distressed state  abandoned and helpless  and relying on the emergency services (police) for help. So  Taste the Difference  is Sainsbury s way of  fighting back  !!! It s been nearly a week and the experience is still fresh and a talking point within our community and certainly before they built Sainsbury s (Knaphill  Surrey). I still urge people to avoid shopping there and to consider alternatives such as Waitrose in Goldsworth Park and Morrisons in Woking  where I believe they value customers irrespective if they have a disability and also do not practise  Tasting the Difference  with their customers - more of a great shopping experience. If you are going to shop in Sainsbury s then I would urge you to reduce your shop by not purchasing an item and consider either buying it next time or better still elsewhere. Thanks to all that have supported me and those that will do so in the future.;;;;;2016-08-10T09:46:39+0000;1470822399;2016-08-10 11:46:39;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I live most local to a Tesco garage and normally always get my fuel there. As a stickler for routine I was debating attempting to get home and avoid the  unfamiliar garage  but I stopped in to your Glastonbury  Somerset garage. The lady who served me was called  Di  and straight away she welcomed me with a warm smile! Having never met me before she asked me straight away how my day had been and struck up conversation with me which was lovely. All too often people forget how much a kind smile can change someone s day. I came away feeling really happy which just goes to show what a massive difference great customer service can make! I work with the public on a daily basis and I think that Di is a perfect example of how we would all like our employees to be! Thank you Di for taking the  time to make my day that little bit brighter! ⭐️;;;;;2016-08-09T17:09:05+0000;1470762545;2016-08-09 19:09:05;7;4;8;0;12;4;1;3;1;0;7;1;0;0;0;0;0

And he still went ahead and handed items over knowing it was not me..in my case I am lucky they where just deliverd to my mother.. it cud have been a complete stranger as he was willing to hand over knowing full well it was not myself  They delivery driver even spoke to mum who had no clue why groceries turned up at her door. When he mentioned my name i.e knowing it was not me my mum accepted thinking I had done her a nice little suprise im sure she was gutted to find out that I had not.. poor thing..  So after a long conversation with the online support team I decided was best just to leave items there as it s lurgan and in in Belfast can t just nip down and collect them so I said I will tmoz.. but the girl from the online team refused to even raise it as a complaint as she put it the store done nothing wrong.. which was very patronising  and infuriating..  How can a company not return fresh produce that had been literally handed over in the two minutes took to contact them and drag the conversation on for 45 minutes. I can understand if had been a few hours r the next day but they had literally just been handed over and my mother only signed for them as it was under my name.. it was ridiculous and being refused to go through to complaints was even more infuriating;;;;;2016-08-09T11:32:33+0000;1470742353;2016-08-09 13:32:33;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

If you are thinking of doing so today then please remember that there are alternatives available: Waitrose in Goldworth Park and Morrisons in Woking. Again thanks also to those on holiday for assurances for your support upon your return and naturally once the children are back to school: Sir Winston Churchill and St John s. For those not familiar with the story  I was treated to  Taste The Difference  on Thursday whilst shopping at Sainsbury s (Knaphill  Surrey). In summary  Sainsbury s subjected me to a verbal assault  on several occasions  and also with my son present ! Whist  stick and stones may ....  worst was to come when then physically entered my car and stole my car keys along with my house keys. Apart from being shake  I was forced to call 999 and ask assistance by the police as I was stranded and also to have own property back! I certainly tasted the difference and as a result we as a family along with friends and others in the community have decided not shop at Sainsbury s (Knaphill  Surrey). We have also extended this to all Sainsbury s. Whilst I cannot possibly win against one of the so called big boys purely on size  I am sure that every little bit helps  so I am asking that you to do the same and not shop at Sainsbury s  ideally ever  but even the once  or even purchase a single item elsewhere  for every item counts. Thank you for your support. P.S. Also to mention Jeroen Peters who requested to stop buying John West Tuna for the effects on other animals/mammals when fishing for the Tuna. Thank you for your support.;;;;;2016-08-09T06:55:42+0000;1470725742;2016-08-09 08:55:42;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Tesco has stopped selling their tuna because it is extremely unsustainable & John West has made no improvement in the last five years.   In 2016  fishing practices shouldn t kill turtles and sharks.

To me it showed how forward thinking  innovative and ethical you were.  However I am afraid I will no longer be a customer at Sainsbury s. I am disappointed to find out that you are selling John West Tuna   even though you are aware that they practice unsustainable fishing practices.  I thought you were better then this leaders of Sainsbury s  - Who makes the decision on what products gets stocked on the shelves? There is a human being making this decision and that person or persons at present are showing me that Sainsbury s does not care for the environment or for it s customers.  It only cares about the bottom line   how much profit it can make at the expense of everyone and everything else. I ask that you do the right   and moral thing and refuse to sell John West Tuna.  Until then I and numerous other Sainsbury s customers will be going to your competitors who have done so already.;;;;;2016-08-08T15:24:04+0000;1470669844;2016-08-08 17:24:04;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Just to refresh some readers this was following  Taste the Difference  treatment from Sainsbury s that extended from their products to include their services where by I was verbally abused on three occasions and later with my son. Worst was to come when they entered my private vehicle and stole my car keys along with house keys and others. Being distressed and stranded without my property and the refusal of Sainsbury s to return these forced me to call the wonderful services of the Surrey Police services who retrieved these from me. No apology to date to both myself and son. Perhaps  Taste the Difference  brand is above the law. In any case  I would like to remind all those that are away on holiday that upon your return (and the online shopping in advance) and those that are about to go away to not shop at Sainsbury s (Knaphill) or any other branch  and if you have to  then please do not purchase a single item that you was going to.

Yesterday I bought your Little Ones size 2 nappies for my 7 week old  I m a new mum and having a baby is a totally new experience and I was lucky enough to have my husband around until this week when he s returned to work  so this weeks been more of an eye opener as a new mum.  So far I have used your nappies for 20 hours  and every  and that no exaggeration  every nappy has leaked urine causing me to have to change my sons clothes at every nappy change!! And it makes it that little bit harder when he hates being undressed and cries constantly until his clothes are back on!   Safe to say Sainsbury s for my washing piles sake  my sons sake and for me  I will be returning to Aldi s and be using their nappies which don t leak and are cheaper . . .;;;;;2016-08-08T09:16:11+0000;1470647771;2016-08-08 11:16:11;2;4;2;0;6;4;3;1;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

They were for my families dinner that night so I didn t think I needed to check the date. I got home and the use by date on the pack was the 5th!! Unacceptable to have out of date meat on your shelves! I am 4 months pregnant so if I d have eaten these without checking the date me and my baby could ve been very ill! I returned to the store and was given £5 off my £70 shopping bill. The sausages were £3 which I expected for free so for my inconvenience of having to travel 20 miles there and back to your store I received £2. Can t say I am happy with this!!

Went with my mum for a coffee after our shopping and the attitude of some of the staff is unbelievable.  My mum bought a scone and the butter was so hard that it broke the scone. Fine no problem. When we asked the lady at the counter if we could have another butter she had the cheek to say we would have to pay for one! We even showed her the broken scone and unspreadable butter. She just shrugged and again said she d have to charge for another. My mum wasn t happy and had to complain to another member of staff.  With a long background in retail I m constantly baffled by the terrible attitude of staff.

No member of staff serving  the only member of staff to be seen was  taking chairs down (feet down) from table tops. I assume the chairs were still there from close of business yesterday  placed on the table tops for the floor to be cleaned. Staff member realises he has customers  came over to take our order....didn t wash his hands. After serving us he promptly returned to removing more chairs from table tops to place back on the floor. At no point during our very brief visit did any member of staff come to clean the table tops prior to other customers now sitting at the tables (with and without children) to eat/drink at.  Husband and I chose to sit  very briefly  at a table with fixed seats  assume no chairs had been stood from the floor to the table. Three tables later....finally found a table without greasy  grubby residue from yesterday s trade on it. Left  without doing the weekly shop  unimpressed with simple basic hygiene standards not being met. Well seriously  would you expect me to buy from your bakery  deli  meat or fish counters if their standards of cleanliness and hygiene match that of your cafe?;;;;;2016-08-07T15:51:26+0000;1470585086;2016-08-07 17:51:26;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

He had been given a visa debit gift card for his birthday and i didn t think twice about handing this over to the cashier  sainsburys being a major retailer after all. I was told that sainsburys systems are not set up to accept these cards  despite the terms and conditions clearly stating they are accepted anywhere that accepts debit cards. I was  therefore unable to use it. I spoke to customer services who were also unable to accept this card. I then spoke to a manager who suggested that i ought to speak to the card provider. Well  i returned home and did just that. The card is fine and armed with the money as i thought. So sainsburys why dont your systems accept these widely available  entirely valid forms of payment? Not good enough from such a huge UK brand. I left both disappointed and frustrated  as well as out of pocket and was not impressed at all with your store manager s response.

I attempted to purchase a bottle of champagne at your store in Oldbury  West Midlands at about midday today and was asked for ID even though I am 35 years old! As I don t drive and don t make a habit of taking my passport with me when I shop  I tried to reason with the woman on the checkout  pointing out I clearly didn t appear under 18  probably wouldn t be buying expensive champagne if I was an underage drinker etc  etc  all to no avail. The woman said she was 41 and still got asked for ID and I would have to come back with my passport. After 30 minutes round trip home and back to collect my passport I returned to complete my purchase- I was heading back to the same checkout as to be honest I wanted to make my point; but the same woman had put a sign up saying the till was closed as I approached  though she was still sitting there. I ended up using one of the self service checkouts  called another member of staff over to approve the purchase  and she DIDN T ASK TO SEE ANY ID! From this  I deduce that I clearly do not appear underage  and that the first member of staff was at fault in insisting on my bringing ID-why have I wasted half an hour of my time bringing something that I wasn t ultimately required to produce? Is it your policy to allow your staff to decide not to serve customers on the grounds that they don t like their face? The woman on the checkout who refused to serve me was middle aged with dark hair and what looked like a false front tooth. I m not going to describe the second member of staff as my problem isn t with her and I don t want to get her into any trouble. Thank you in advance for looking into this.

Thanks also to those on holiday for taking the time to show your support and action upon your return. I also understand that when the children return back to school that we will alternate our shopping between other supermarkets in Goldsworth Park and Woking. For those not familiar with the story  I was treated to  Taste The Difference  on Thursday whilst shopping at Sainsbury s (Knaphill  Surrey). In summary  Sainsbury s subjected me to a verbal assault  on several occasions  and also with my son present ! Whist  stick and stones may ....  worst was to come when then physically entered my car and stole my car keys along with my house keys. Apart from being shake  I was forced to call 999 and ask for the police so that I can my have own property back. I certainly tasted the difference and as a result we as a family along with friends and others in the community have decided not shop at Sainsbury s (Knaphill  Surrey). We have also extended this to all Sainsbury s. Whilst I cannot possibly win against one of the so called big boys purely on size  I am sure that every little bit helps  so I am asking that you too do the same and not shop at Sainsbury s  ideally ever  but even the once  or even purchase a single item elsewhere  for every item counts.

What gets me is the way you have manipulated and demanded on this family business and because they cannot meet your horrific demands you give 7 DAYS notice; even though they have traded there for 7 YEARS.

I was shopping with my 10 month old daughter in her baby carrier. I was very impressed with all the vegan options as I usually don t find as many yummy looking things in other supermarkets. I got to the checkout and an employee unloaded my shopping for me while I nipped to get some avocados. She was very helpful and lovely. When I came back  I was saying this to the lady scanning my shopping how impressed I was with all their vegan options. She was pretty grumpy and just said  oh right . I figured she doesn t want a conversation so continued to pack my shopping up. I was paying by card and my card was declined (embarrassing enough). She says in a very moody voice  its declined . I said I was sorry and it was the only card I had on me. I called my partner to put some money across and told her it will just be a couple of minutes. She then just stood there and looked at me  I was unsure what she was wanting me to do so asked..? She said she would save the shopping and ask someone to take it to costumer service. She was incredibly moody and rude. What was already a very embarrassing situation with a line of people  she made even more uncomfortable for me. Luckily the lady who came to take my shopping to customer services was absolutely lovely  explaining that it happens all the time and not to feel embarrassed. I didn t get their names as I was flustered. If it hadn t been for the two lovely ladies helping me I wouldn t be going back!;;;;;2016-08-06T10:06:00+0000;1470477960;2016-08-06 12:06:00;0;1;0;1;2

I usually shop in store as partner works there but after shopping online with Asda we thought we would try this.Normally takes an hour on other apps but took 3 hours as it kept crashing every time I added something to trolley meaning I had to go through all menus again to find the section I was at. Then just as I was about to checkout it decided to crash again.log me out and clear my trolley.So I ve gone elsewhere.Missed out on a £200 order;;;;;2016-08-05T13:03:01+0000;1470402181;2016-08-05 15:03:01;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The police were called and were making their way to us as the manager of Hampton Sainsburys came over and was extremely boisterous towards me telling me I wasn t allowed my bike in his shop  the security guard explained to him the circumstances and why I was there but he just basically took sides with the van driver  with how he was acting towards me it really seemed as if the pair of them just hates cyclists. The manager continued to be dismissive of me being there and tried snatching my bike out of my hands for no reason  I pulled it back and told him there is no need for him to touch me or my personal property  he then grabbed it again and pulled it away from me  he lost grip of it  and the bike fell on your clothing stand  which resulted in my front hub on my wheel being broken. This wheel now has to be sent back to France where they made it for it to be fixed at my expense and taking two weeks  I am now without a mode of transport. A police report has been made by the two officers who came to deal with this  and in that report it states that your staff member did snatch my bike and broke as a result.  So please get back to me as soon as possible.;;;;;2016-08-05T11:31:03+0000;1470396663;2016-08-05 13:31:03;3;4;5;10;19;4;4;0;4;0;3;0;0;0;1;1;0

I had the receipt and tried to take it back the next day to exchange it for the correct one. The tin had not been opened. I was told by customer service (in store) that there was nothing that they could do about it as it was Sainburys procedure not to exchange baby milk as someone had tampered with a tin before and bought it back and a baby become ill. I felt upset and angry that I had been tarred with the same brush with the dreadful actions of someone else.  However  can t this be said about all the products you sell ? Yet you exchange and refund them. I think the main reason Sainsburys won t exchange it is because they would have to write that tin off as waste  which goes against individual shop targets.  So  with no resolve I emailed customer service who were   sorry I got the wrong milk   not sorry that Sainsburys couldn t do anything about it. I explained that no where in store or on the receipt does it say you can t exchange baby milk. My questions and comments were ignored and skimmed over with the offer of a £10 ( the price of the milk) gift voucher  which at first I was happy with but then I realised you can t use gift vouchers to buy baby milk. So  again I sent another email explaining that the gift voucher was a nice gesture and a way of shutting me up but you failed to mention I can t buy baby milk with it. I got a reply pretty much saying that they take my comments on board and will pass them on to head office which is a polite way of saying get lost nothing more is going to be done.   I don t understand why Sainsburys won t exchange it as a friend of mine did the same thing at morrisons and had no problem changing it. So now I have a tub of baby milk I can t use and a gift voucher that doesn t get me what I need. This might seem petty to some people but it s the principle of the matter. You have just lost a valued customer and the custom of my family and friends over £10  well done.;;;;;2016-08-04T23:47:55+0000;1470354475;2016-08-05 01:47:55;0;7;0;0;7;7;6;1;19;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Unfortunately after trying on many clothes and choosing the ones she wanted everything got a bit too much for her and she started having chest pains  this got worse  I tried to keep her calm and get her seated on a nearby stool which was proving a bit difficult as I had my two month old daughter in the pushchair but thank goodness for an amazing lady called dawn (who works in the clothing section)  she noticed something wasn t quite right and was extremely helpful with both mum and helping me with my baby. She got mum some water and a first aid person who was called Danny (GM) who was also absolutely fantastic. Mum had her spray but by now it was 40minutes in and it still hadn t eased  mum had started to panic which made everything worse  whilst Danny and I tried to calm mum dawn managed to block off the area to give us some privacy and looked after my baby  the paramedics were called and arrived taking mum to the hospital. I am so grateful that both members of staff we dealt with were just beyond amazing and without their help who knows what could have happened.

I m now left with clothes that won t fit me unless I go up a dress size and surplus clothes that my son won t wear thanks to the English weather.

Rang up when I got home and spoke to a lovely employee who contacted the store only to be told no one was there to deal with it and that they didn t know which delivery driver it was and that someone from the store would call me first thing this morning  they didn t. Called this morning again for another lovely employee to contact the store to be told they had been left a note but didn t know what it was and that all drivers were busy today but there MIGHT be one between 2-3 which I said was not acceptable as I am out for the day and these items should have been priority. I was obviously unhappy about this and the lady went back to the store and explained this wasn t acceptable as I placed an order to be delivered at a certain time  it has all been paid for (yesterday the money has been taken from my account) and it is not my fault that 16 items have not been delivered. They then said they have a driver around 5:30 - 6:30 this evening and will call me once they ve contacted the driver (still waiting for a call) Both the ladies at the call centre were very apologetic and helpful but the way this is being dealt with by the store is shocking. I shop monthly online with yourselves and am also a regular customer in your stores and am really disappointed.  My order number is 40868534;;;;;2016-08-03T08:01:48+0000;1470211308;2016-08-03 10:01:48;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I had been at Flambards (the amusement park next door) all day and had popped in on my way home with my very tired three year old daughter and ten week old baby in tow. Not long into my shop  down the butter aisle  my daughter decided to throw the mother of all tantrums which she continued for the remainder of my shop; screaming  shouting  kicking  attempting to climb out of the trolley  actually managing to climb out of the trolley and running off... It was not an enjoyable visit to say the least! I was humbled by the support of other shoppers who could clearly see (and most definitely hear!) what my  darling  child was putting me through. Then one of your employees  Jonathan  approached me and offered his assistance. He offered to pick up any items I still required from the shop (I had already finished my shop though) and then took my trolley and pushed it towards the tills  where he then proceeded to open a till especially to serve me. Another member of staff  Ryan  helped him to load my shopping on to the conveyer belt and bag up my shopping. They also offered to help me out to the carpark to load the shopping into my car (I didn t take them up on this offer but in hindsight wished I had as I battled with strapping in two children while it poured down with rain!). I was so grateful for Jonathan and Ryan s help this afternoon and for being very patient and even trying to put a smile on my daughter s face at the till (when she had calmed down a tiny bit). Despite the drama  I left the store feeling very humbled by the majority of people in it and especially the kindness of your two very helpful employees Jonathan and Ryan who made such a difference for me today!";;;;;2016-08-02T19:58:20+0000;1470167900;2016-08-02 21:58:20;9924;528;10478;547;11553;512;326;186;1196;0;9826;490;59;1;0;0;0

I have phoned numerous times and I have e-mailed but have been told I wasn t charged however I have the bank statement to prove it. I did get some sense out of the staff at the Pontypridd store who told me to e-mail a copy of my statement to your online customer service.

I was looking at getting a baby sleep bag  which had a sticker for half price. There was another design which was also Half price but not the size I wanted. There were 2 of each design right at the back. When I took it to the till it came out full price. When I questioned this I was told people have been going round putting the stickers on  and its a new line. Why if you have a new line only have 2 and have them right at the back. I have seen that design in store for months. I asked to see a manager but I was passed to someone who works in the clothing department who just looked on the system and said its full price  and she can not sell it for half price. My question is that it has been advertised at half price you should really honour this  as it is misleading. My opinion to stop this happening again and for people moving the stickers for half price is that you change your system so this confusion does not happen again. But why would someone put a sticker for half price on an item and put it back if they didn t want it.  I was not happy with the way I was spoken to and left the store  without any compromise on the item I wanted to buy which was advertised as half price.;;;;;2016-08-02T16:25:41+0000;1470155141;2016-08-02 18:25:41;0;5;0;0;5;5;3;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

However twice now my 5 year old daughter has been hit by one of your online shoppers  and both times she has been stood looking at items to buy  not running around or causing mischief.    At five  she is a little too big to sit in the trolley seat comfortably  and can t sit in the trolley when I am shopping  so helps by picking her own items.    Yesterday she was choosing her yoghurts when she was hit by someone for the second time in less that a week.  The staff member was apologetic  but it doesn t help when my daughter 36 hours later still has a mark on her ear where the end of the trolley hit her  and couldn t lay on that side as it was tender.  Is it just Calcot where most of the staff can t see over the end of the trolley which causes the problem?  It isn t a reflection on the staff  more a design issue with your trollies.  I m not sure what the answer is  maybe parking sensors on the front of the trolley or taller staff?;;;;;2016-08-02T15:46:37+0000;1470152797;2016-08-02 17:46:37;1;5;1;0;6;5;1;4;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

My lovely daughter has worked for Sainsbury s stafford  for five and half years. Now after all that time she s leaving for a new career in public services. I want to thank your team for all the help and support your team have given her over the years. A big thank you from one very proud mum.;;;;;2016-08-02T07:55:53+0000;1470124553;2016-08-02 09:55:53;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

You got that one right on so many different levels. From the loving relationships with his mum and big sister to the idea that he goes to main stream school. Just like any other kid. You touched on such simple hopes and aspirations a parent can have for their child who has Down syndrome.

I regularly use this store to pick up a few bits. I went to use the self check out and was attempting to buy a cold and flu syrup. A new member of staff who must have only been about 18 asked me for proof that I was 16 years old +. I dug around in my bag and found my Postgraduate university identity card with my picture on which clearly states I m a postgraduate student and also showed my NUS card again with my photo and my date of birth. Despite this he refused to sell me the flu syrup and seemed to find the whole thing incredibly funny at my expense. I am very angry to say the least and would like to hear from one of your Customer Services team about this. Thank you.;;;;;2016-08-01T10:47:38+0000;1470048458;2016-08-01 12:47:38;0;10;0;0;10;10;1;9;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0
