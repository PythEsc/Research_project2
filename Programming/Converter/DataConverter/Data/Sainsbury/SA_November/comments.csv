What I would like to add is we were grateful to Callum who was the person serving us. we were in the store for an hour and forty five minutes trying to locate stock there or another if they didn t have it. I have to say Callum did everything possible  nothing was too much trouble for him to deal with our faulty tv. He was polite and was trying his best to resolve the issue there and then aswell as doing other jobs on the customer service desk. He made what could have been a stressful situation into one that really wasn t. I really hope he gets recognised for his great customer service we can t fault him. Please pass on our thanks;2016-11-30T22:46:25+0000;10155497541344377_10155498994844377;pageowner;0;Hey!

Ordered my son Lego Dimensions for Xmas last night priced at £39.99 only to notice on the receipt when it was delivered this morning that the offer has now ended and I ve been charged £49.99....now surely when I ordered it last night for delivery  there was no possible way of getting it at that price  so why was I allowed to order it at that price? Had I known the offer was ending I would have waited for the stock to come back in at Smyths and not only would it have been £5 cheaper  but he d would have also got a free fun pack with it!;2016-11-30T17:08:09+0000;10155496609704377_10155496702169377;pageowner;0;Hi Kerry, really sorry about this!

He is 6 years old and questioning whether Santa is real already 😢 so I am going all out this Christmas to make him believe again. He knew the elf was bringing him the advent calendar. Unfortunately I received a call ten minutes ago saying you d swapped the Lego advent calendar for a Lindt chocolate one. It hardly compares  does it. Had I known in advance I could have ordered one online as stores are completely sold out. So thanks for that Sainsbury s.

My little 2 year old  Tilly  has had a really tough couple of weeks with being poorly. We called into the cafe this morning and Tilly was really upset and grumpy - Dee took the time to speak to her and tell her what a lovely girl she is. After we had sat down  Dee came back over with a toy she had bought for Tilly to help keep her calm and occupied whilst I had a few minutes of peace and quiet. It was really appreciated and other customers were really blown away by this kind act and came to talk to Tilly as well. Thank you so much - I used to actually work in this store and cafe and have come here for years. They really do look after their customers � xxx;2016-11-29T10:19:38+0000;10155492071564377_10155492124139377;pageowner;0;That is so lovely to hear Vicky!

At Sainsbury’s we aim to make our customers’ shopping experience as effortless and efficient as possible. Using the customer feedback we receive we've found that when buying children's products, most customers prefer to shop by gender and then age. In line with other major retailers we therefore specify children's ranges under boy's and girl's, much as we do with men's and women's. We believe this makes it easier to navigate and locate products, both in store and online. We really value our customers’ comments, so we take feedback of this nature seriously. Can you confirm which store you visited and I can pass your feedback on? Thanks, Monica.;2016-11-28T18:16:31+0000;0

Usually the Clifton Down store on Whiteladies Road in Bristol.  I did use the online feedback form to ask them to look into other options, but nothing is happening.  Examples include the fresh fruit 'n' veg section where my healthy snacks for work would include plastic containers and film lids, only some parts of which are recyclable.  I often used to buy nuts but they're in totally non-recyclable bags.  The deli/hot food section serves things in plastic-paper bags, which being mixed material are also non-recyclable.  I do understand the need to protect the food and stop grease, but there are other ways and all that we are left with a few minutes afterwards is plastic galore.  The amount they sell each week nationwide must mean a ridiculous amount of money is spent on generating waste for landfill. :/;2016-11-28T15:21:52+0000;1

The new slots require you to put the coin in a sliding carrier  that is then pushed into the lock release mechanism  thus allowing you to take the trolley.   These are much fiddlier than the previous  push it in the slot  mechanisms  and as a person with arthritic hands  very difficult to operate.  I had to have someone help me with it  as I found pushing the carrier in to be impossible.  Were any Disabled Groups consulted about this new design?  Are there plans to introduce a version that differently abled people (and left handers for that matter) find easier to use?;2016-11-28T10:05:55+0000;10155488794364377_10155492935564377;pageowner;0;Hi Liz, For some background on this, this was shown and presented in our disability working group. I think the initial thought was this would be an easier lock to use as you are not having to push the £1 coin in, instead you are placing the coin into the lock and pushing the lock into the mechanism. We appreciate the feedback, we will raise this back into the workshop to see how this reflects back. Hayley;2016-11-29T16:21:05+0000;0

After taking in a large cake order yesterday morning  for a family get together  I was uncertain if the Bakery could do it  as I needed the cakes for the this afternoon. Having spoken to the Store Manager  and Sam from the Bakery department  they would of preferred 5 days notice  but still  assured me they could do it. When I went to collect them this morning  there they were  all boxed  named and ready to go! I was so amazed! I can not thank the fantastic team enough for all their hard work and effort they put in to complete my order. Needless to say  the family get together was so lovely  and having exceptional cakes  made it that extra special! Once again  thank you all.

We aim to make our customers’ shopping experience as effortless and efficient as possible. Using customer feedback, we've found that when buying childrens’ products, most customers prefer to shop by gender and then age. In line with other major retailers we therefore specify childrens’ ranges under boys’ and girls’, much as we do with men and women. We believe this makes it easier to navigate and locate products, both in store and online however you should feel free to purchase whatever items you feel your child would be happiest with. I've logged the details of your experience so that they can be taken into consideration when our ranges are next reviewed, and this'll allow us to continue to improve our products and services.

My 14 year old daughter was with me in Chester today when we walked past your express store in Watergate Street she noticed that there was cash sticking out of the cash point which had been left behind. We removed it and there was £ 50 there and then asked around to see if anyone had seen who used the cash point but no one knew who it was. Holly (my daughter) then had no hesitation in going into your store and handing it in to your staff. I am very proud of her as I am sure you can imagine £ 50 would have made her shopping trip in Chester far more enjoyable. Your staff thanked her for being so honest and said that there was a camera at the cash point and if someone did try and claim it then they could check it was theirs. I was hoping you could find out for us from the store if anyone came back to claim it or not. Holly was worried about how the person would feel when they noticed they had lost it. We look forward to hearing from you hopefully. Kind Regards Clair Eccleston  proud Mum of Holly Eccleston;2016-11-27T18:40:18+0000;10155486852179377_10155486983894377;pageowner;0;Hi Clair!

We look forward to hearing from you hopefully.

Sainsbury’s aim to make our customers’ shopping experience as effortless and efficient as possible.  Using customer feedback, we've found that when buying childrens’ products, most customers prefer to shop by gender and then age.  In line with other major retailers we therefore specify childrens’ ranges under boys’ and girls’, much as we do with mens’ and womens’.  We believe this makes it easier to navigate and locate products, both in store and online.  We really value our customers’ comments, so we take feedback of this nature seriously.

My children are two and four and have a range of interests from playing make believe with toys to outdoor sports and games.  I want them to be warm in the winter and cool in the summer with practical clothes that withstand the general wear and tear of climbing  running  swinging  playing in sand and everything else small children love to do.  They need to be washed after almost every wear due to splashed mud and paint  spilt food and unfortunately the occasional toileting accident.  My children like many colours and enjoy watching a wide variety of TV programmes and films from Pixar to CBeebies.  I am a grown woman in my 30s and I know my children and am able to differentiate between colours and characters that they like without somebody in a marketing department somewhere making arbitrary choices for me.  As a result  I am continually frustrated by the unhelpful way clothes are organised in my local Sainsbury s.  Children s clothes are separated into 3 different age categories as well as gender divides so if I m looking for warm practical trousers that can be worn in the winter months playing outside for both my children  there are 4 different sections I need to look through for me to find something suitable.  If all the trousers were in one place  it would actually make shopping a lot easier.  The gender divide in particular results in awful slogans perpetuating negative stereotypes such as girls are only valued on their appearance and boys are inherently naughty.  Some characters are only available on one gender or age range even though they might have universal appeal.  As an example  clothes with Paw Patrol on them only feature boy characters on the boys clothes and girl characters on the girls clothes.  I have read on another page that you have stated customer preference for arranging clothes as you do but I can honestly say this is not my preference.  Please can you look into organising all children s clothes according to type.  Both my children wear a range of clothes bought from the boys and the girls sections in a variety of shops as well as hand-me-downs from other boys and girls.  Children s body shapes are not that different until they reach puberty and in the interest of bringing up well rounded individuals  I try my hardest not to limit their interests with outdated attitudes.  I have worked in marketing myself and understand the various audience segmentation tools that companies use and how a microscopic focus on ROI leads many companies to treat them as gospel.  In my opinion  however  lazy use of gendered colours  images and slogans just leads to the perpetuation of potentially damaging stereotypes and in this day and age  particularly when it comes to children  I think any company that makes an example of themselves by taking a stand would actually reap far more benefit from a greater proportion of the population.

Sainsbury’s aim to make our customers’ shopping experience as effortless and efficient as possible.  Using customer feedback, we've found that when buying childrens’ products, most customers prefer to shop by gender and then age.  In line with other major retailers we therefore specify childrens’ ranges under boys’ and girls’, much as we do with mens’ and womens’.  We believe this makes it easier to navigate and locate products, both in store and online.  We really value our customers’ comments, so we take feedback of this nature seriously.  I've logged the details of your experience so that they can be taken into consideration when our ranges are next reviewed, and this'll allow us to continue to improve our products and services.

If not, we need to contact Nectar and have them unblock your card. Can you PM us details of the colleague you spoke with please? Maria;2016-11-27T17:16:53+0000;0

I placed an online order on Friday for a Lego Star Wars advent calendar along with 2 other Lego items as part of your 3 for 2 deal  and some groceries. My son has been looking forward to getting this specific advent calendar for Christmas. When I arrived at the Click at Collect point  this afternoon I found that they have substituted the advent calendar with a Minions one and charged me full price for the other 2 Lego items. I just left my entire order behind. Your customer service team was no help at all and can t even tell me which stores have stock of the calendar. The money has already been taken off my account and will only apparently be back in my account towards the end of next week.

Any meat from a supermarket is intensively farmed. British produce doesnt mean it isnt very intensively farmed. Especially for pies and things like black pudding ( thats if it is even british meat being used and not that the components arent just put together in the uk to make for example a pie). When you drive along and see cows in fields quite sparsely populated these arent destined for supermarket beef burgers or steaks. Imagine how much meat tesco, morrisons , sainsburys etc sell and for how little they sell it. I bought a chicken for about £2.30 a few weeks ago and diced beef for £2.59. The only way supermarkets can make money on these products is to intensively farm in a small space. Just raising animals as quickly as they can by constantly feeding them and keeping them awake longer via the use of artificial lighting.;2016-11-27T18:28:45+0000;0

This evening my son and I shopped for household products and food at our local store. On our departure I remembered that we needed logs for our fire.

Pretty unheard of these days as film nights with mum aren t so cool or whatever the word is for that these days. We picked up two bags of logs from your petroleum station on the way out of the store.  Paid £6/bag for what I d normally pay half at other high street named store.  But I figured the time saving was worth it  because it meant longer with my son.  So  fast forward to having a lovely evening of film watching and being snug. I asked my lad to open the bag of logs.   They re a bit damp  he says. We tried for over 3 hours to light the driest logs.  No joy...do no toasty room.  Could have saved myself 2 3/4 hours and £6 overall on my original £12 purchase.  I m not sure that I can find my receipt but I m so beyond disappointed I felt I needed to contact you.  Surely   if you re going to sell these products  you should store them so they should be fit for purpose?  Especially when they are double the cost of many other retailers.

This evening my son and I shopped for household products and food at our local store. On our departure I remembered that we needed logs for our fire.

Pretty unheard of these days as film nights with mum aren t so cool or whatever the word is for that these days.

But I figured the time saving was worth it  because it meant longer with my son.  So  fast forward to having a lovely evening of film watching and being snug. I asked my lad to open the bag of logs.   They re a bit damp  he says. We tried for over 3 hours to light the driest logs.  No joy...do no toasty room.

I took my 85 year old grandfather and my 6 month old daughter in her buggy. I decided we would stop for coffee and cake before shopping  however when we got to the lift to go up to the cafe it was out of order. I then had to walk my grandfather and get the buggy over to customer services to see if there was another way up since the lift wasn t in service  I was advised that the lift had been broken for 2 weeks and they didn t know when it was to be fixed and there was no other way up to the cafe other than the stairs. This was obviously going to prove difficult due to the buggy and my grandfather. In the end I had to ask customer services had to find a member of staff to help me carry my daughter in her buggy up the stairs  wait with her at the top whilst I helped my grandfather up the stairs. Then we had to wait for a member of staff to do the same when we wanted to go down. Luckily there were no accidents when carrying the buggy up and down with my daughter in it!  I understand things break and need fixing but firstly 2 weeks is a long time to have the only lift broken  and secondly we are lucky that my grandfather could use the stairs (albeit took a while for him and knackered him out!). If he was in a wheel chair or not as able  the stairs wouldn t have been an option! By law do you not have to have a lift as essentially you are saying no one in a wheelchair can use your cafe until the lift is fixed?!   Of course we could have not gone to the cafe but my grandfather is diabetic and he needed to eat something to keep his bloods stable.  Not impressed sainsburys with no lift  having to leave my daughter with a stranger  and the general attitude of your customer service staff who really couldn t care less!;2016-11-26T10:48:31+0000;10155482499224377_10155482636474377;pageowner;0;Hello.

Your driver failed to give us 17 of our items  none of which have shown up as being unavailable on our receipt  and I have been charged for. The driver then sent my husband inside the van to look for the remainder of our order. Oh and did I mention that when he called  30minutes late he voiced his disappointment that we live on the third floor and asked for help... my husband obliged on the bases he was running late  and yet what a disaster this all turned out to be. We did not sign for our shop because he couldn t work his hand held computer  accused my husband of loosing the receipt  even though the delivery man later found it in his van  and refused to give us any contact information regarding our concerns that a substantial amount of our shopping was missing even though we had been billed for it. Disgusted and disappointed.  Rude and unprofessional.;2016-11-26T00:28:47+0000;10155481174944377_10155482280694377;pageowner;0;Hey. I'm really sorry about that.

It's not the point really- the dates are normally a good few days from day of purchase and if I had picked it up in store it would likely be either reduced or I would have picked one up with a few days on it. I might not even have a working freezer at the moment or even have one at all- not everyone does. Then it would be wasted and I hate food waste.  The point is that I should be able to buy meat that doesn't need to be eaten within 27hours of arriving at my house.;2016-11-25T22:51:18+0000;0

Myself and two colleagues work shifts covering a 24 hour period for the NHS and on the afternoon of Monday 21st of November we were talking about Black Friday  we all thought it would be a good laugh and a chance to get some bargains to head over to Lincoln s Tritton Road store for approximately 11:45pm ready for the Black Friday deals to be revealed at midnight. In preparation for this little outing we checked your website to see if there was any spoilers as to what was going to be in the deals  to our delight there was a few items - great! Upon searching in a very popular search engine  Sainsbury s Black Friday  your Black Friday page was top of the search engine with a link to your site  once on the site you had a countdown box which was counting down to midnight of Friday 25th November with a message underneath saying  Black Friday deals in store only!  Brilliant  we re all set! Plans were made with meeting places and the designated driver was assigned. Plans were going smoothly despite myself and a colleague finishing late from our shift  spirits were high and it was nice to do something socially. The 20 mile trip was made to our most local 24 hour Sainsbury s talking about what we were looking to buy  especially for our children for Christmas and we arrived at 11:45pm to find the car park very empty. However we just thought people weren t as mad as us! When we arrived at the store there was a number of staff smoking outside the main entrance where the general public were still walking past which I found very disrespectful  personally. As we approached the main entrance one of your staff members said to us   you do know we are shutting at midnight until 6 don t you to get ready for the deals?  We we re all laughing and expecting her to say  just joking!  But she didn t  of course it wasn t her fault she was just a member of staff. However  what disappointed us the most was how misleading your website was  with the countdown ending at midnight we fully expected to be allowed around the store which was 24 hours with no signs saying they would be closing early. Due to the nature of our job we then missed the actual sale at 6am this morning.   And I forgot to get some bread.   A response would be gratefully received.;2016-11-25T09:13:16+0000;10155478683234377_10155478726159377;pageowner;0;Hi Charlotte, I can definitely understand your annoyance, sorry about this.

I was in your Edinburgh south bridge branch this evening and there was just two poor girls working to get through a long queue of people resulting in no one to help me because the machine wasn t weighing my item. The nice bouncer did try to help  but as he is not technically a cashier he couldn t do much. I ended up leaving all my groceries on the check out and going to tesco instead. I will be boycotting sainsburys from now on if you think it is acceptable to give staff less hours and therefore less customer attention. Appalling behaviour especially when a lot of our staff will be already be struggling to pay bills before you doing this. Not that anyone at your HO would understand what it s like to struggle to pay bills.

However, you may be interested in the The Greatest Gift Kit (film kit) is a box set for kids to direct their very own animated Christmas film.

However  on this occasion it is regarding a more serious matter. This evening  myself and my sister were putting air in my car tyres at the Sainsbury s petrol station attached to the superstore in Uxbridge on Coldharbour Lane. However next to us  we spotted a cyclist going passed  although unfortunately for him  a drain cover had broken meaning the drain was uncovered and his wheel got caught and subsequently he flew over the handle bars! We rushed over towards him  and whilst my sister pulled the bike off of him I rang for an ambulance. He was able to sit himself up  however he had gone face first  broke his helmet and smashed his glasses  so as you can imagine there was a lot of blood! I stayed with him whilst my sister went into the store to get more help  but she was met by a member of staff who simply handed her the emergency first aid bag and then wandered off. My sister then had to administer minimal treatment herself until the emergency response arrived! Once the emergency response came we moved inside and were given paperwork to fill out. For the rest of the duration from which the accident took place and the patient being taken to hospital in the ambulance  there was very minimal and poor communication from the 3 members of staff who we met. And we did all the paperwork! We asked the patient the questions  we got his details  we stayed with him until he was taken to the hospital  and we took his bike back to his address where his mum was very appreciative for all we did for him. And that s ok for us  we are both disabled and we appreciate what it means to have someone stop  stay  talk with and help in any way possible when an accident happens. But your staff were useless  showed no empathy and didn t care - that s just wrong. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in Sainsbury s  for not taking care in their outside environment which tonight therefore resulted in an accident. I am also disappointed about their entire attitude towards the patient  ourselves and the emergency response staff on scene. We were in disbelief!!  I want to see that the drains are fixed so that this accident does not happen to someone else  and I want to make sure ALL staff who work for Sainsbury s are first aid trained. In the event of a life/death emergency  tonight  your staffs inability to deal with an emergency could result in someone s death...  I also hope you contact the patient himself and ensure you look after him well!! #SortItSainsburys 👎🏼;2016-11-24T01:06:53+0000;10155474551644377_10155475652389377;4a02f7bf20dffd263751f1513ebbd543b324323c;1;Thank you Marion!

We rushed over towards him  and whilst my sister pulled the bike off of him I rang for an ambulance. He was able to sit himself up  however he had gone face first  broke his helmet and smashed his glasses  so as you can imagine there was a lot of blood! I stayed with him whilst my sister went into the store to get more help  but she was met by a member of staff who simply handed her the emergency first aid bag and then wandered off. My sister then had to administer minimal treatment herself until the emergency response arrived! Once the emergency response came we moved inside and were given paperwork to fill out. For the rest of the duration from which the accident took place and the patient being taken to hospital in the ambulance  there was very minimal and poor communication from the 3 members of staff who we met. And we did all the paperwork! We asked the patient the questions  we got his details  we stayed with him until he was taken to the hospital  and we took his bike back to his address where his mum was very appreciative for all we did for him. And that s ok for us  we are both disabled and we appreciate what it means to have someone stop  stay  talk with and help in any way possible when an accident happens. But your staff were useless  showed no empathy and didn t care - that s just wrong. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in Sainsbury s  for not taking care in their outside environment which tonight therefore resulted in an accident. I am also disappointed about their entire attitude towards the patient  ourselves and the emergency response staff on scene. We were in disbelief!!  I want to see that the drains are fixed so that this accident does not happen to someone else  and I want to make sure ALL staff who work for Sainsbury s are first aid trained. In the event of a life/death emergency  tonight  your staffs inability to deal with an emergency could result in someone s death...  I also hope you contact the patient himself and ensure you look after him well!! #SortItSainsburys 👎🏼;2016-11-24T01:06:53+0000;10155474551644377_10155475123024377;84edf1f16d0fe00be69542fe39f8363c955c3d29;0;Proud of you  Lizzy and Anna x;2016-11-24T05:20:42+0000;0

My father is employed to clean the car park and the rest of the outside space of the store. While he was working on the morning 22.11.16 he was suffering from chest pains  he asked a lot of staff that where starting their shift if they could help him as he was ill. Each staff member just walked past my father and give him a dirty look. My dad was suffering a heart attack at the time he was asking for help and if only one member of staff stopped and spoke to him he would have been diagnosed of being ill and sent to hospital a lot earlier.  I assume that staff at this store is first aid trained. My dad couldn’t either find any staff from the cleaning team to report that he was ill and was leaving the premises to seek medical help.  He had to drive home while suffering from a heart attack. This could have caused a serious accident or tradegy where people lost lifes. When at home my mother saw how bad he was and rang his G.P. His G.P then rang for an ambulance to take him to hospital  when he was assessed by the paramedic of suffering a heart attack and he was blue lighted straight to James Cook hospital  where he was observed by the wonderful staff from the hospital  that afternoon he had to undertake an operation on his heart and had to have two stents fitted.

My father is employed to clean the car park and the rest of the outside space of the store. While he was working on the morning 22.11.16 he was suffering from chest pains  he asked a lot of staff that where starting their shift if they could help him as he was ill. Each staff member just walked past my father and give him a dirty look. My dad was suffering a heart attack at the time he was asking for help and if only one member of staff stopped and spoke to him he would have been diagnosed of being ill and sent to hospital a lot earlier.  I assume that staff at this store is first aid trained. My dad couldn’t either find any staff from the cleaning team to report that he was ill and was leaving the premises to seek medical help.  He had to drive home while suffering from a heart attack. This could have caused a serious accident or tradegy where people lost lifes. When at home my mother saw how bad he was and rang his G.P. His G.P then rang for an ambulance to take him to hospital  when he was assessed by the paramedic of suffering a heart attack and he was blue lighted straight to James Cook hospital  where he was observed by the wonderful staff from the hospital  that afternoon he had to undertake an operation on his heart and had to have two stents fitted.

My dad was suffering a heart attack at the time he was asking for help and if only one member of staff stopped and spoke to him he would have been diagnosed of being ill and sent to hospital a lot earlier.  I assume that staff at this store is first aid trained. My dad couldn’t either find any staff from the cleaning team to report that he was ill and was leaving the premises to seek medical help.  He had to drive home while suffering from a heart attack. This could have caused a serious accident or tradegy where people lost lifes. When at home my mother saw how bad he was and rang his G.P. His G.P then rang for an ambulance to take him to hospital  when he was assessed by the paramedic of suffering a heart attack and he was blue lighted straight to James Cook hospital  where he was observed by the wonderful staff from the hospital  that afternoon he had to undertake an operation on his heart and had to have two stents fitted. I am really glad my father received the right treatment and is recovering well with the support of the hospital and his family.

He had to drive home while suffering from a heart attack. This could have caused a serious accident or tradegy where people lost lifes. When at home my mother saw how bad he was and rang his G.P.

Each staff member just walked past my father and give him a dirty look. My dad was suffering a heart attack at the time he was asking for help and if only one member of staff stopped and spoke to him he would have been diagnosed of being ill and sent to hospital a lot earlier.  I assume that staff at this store is first aid trained. My dad couldn’t either find any staff from the cleaning team to report that he was ill and was leaving the premises to seek medical help.  He had to drive home while suffering from a heart attack. This could have caused a serious accident or tradegy where people lost lifes. When at home my mother saw how bad he was and rang his G.P. His G.P then rang for an ambulance to take him to hospital  when he was assessed by the paramedic of suffering a heart attack and he was blue lighted straight to James Cook hospital  where he was observed by the wonderful staff from the hospital  that afternoon he had to undertake an operation on his heart and had to have two stents fitted. I am really glad my father received the right treatment and is recovering well with the support of the hospital and his family.  I will never shop in Sainsbury’s ever again and hope a lot more people will follow suit because of the rotten treatment of my father suffered in his hour of need.;2016-11-23T19:28:54+0000;10155473770034377_10155476291779377;20ef88e418669741df2b578bae2a88d79a8010c9;0;This needs sharing;2016-11-24T16:30:47+0000;0

I assume that staff at this store is first aid trained. My dad couldn’t either find any staff from the cleaning team to report that he was ill and was leaving the premises to seek medical help.  He had to drive home while suffering from a heart attack. This could have caused a serious accident or tradegy where people lost lifes. When at home my mother saw how bad he was and rang his G.P. His G.P then rang for an ambulance to take him to hospital  when he was assessed by the paramedic of suffering a heart attack and he was blue lighted straight to James Cook hospital  where he was observed by the wonderful staff from the hospital  that afternoon he had to undertake an operation on his heart and had to have two stents fitted. I am really glad my father received the right treatment and is recovering well with the support of the hospital and his family.  I will never shop in Sainsbury’s ever again and hope a lot more people will follow suit because of the rotten treatment of my father suffered in his hour of need.;2016-11-23T19:28:54+0000;10155473770034377_10155476779354377;c859c335aa291674c414ff2ff081a00022450145;0;Absolutely heartbreaking 😔;2016-11-24T19:54:10+0000;0

He had to drive home while suffering from a heart attack. This could have caused a serious accident or tradegy where people lost lifes. When at home my mother saw how bad he was and rang his G.P. His G.P then rang for an ambulance to take him to hospital  when he was assessed by the paramedic of suffering a heart attack and he was blue lighted straight to James Cook hospital  where he was observed by the wonderful staff from the hospital  that afternoon he had to undertake an operation on his heart and had to have two stents fitted.

While he was working on the morning 22.11.16 he was suffering from chest pains  he asked a lot of staff that where starting their shift if they could help him as he was ill. Each staff member just walked past my father and give him a dirty look. My dad was suffering a heart attack at the time he was asking for help and if only one member of staff stopped and spoke to him he would have been diagnosed of being ill and sent to hospital a lot earlier.  I assume that staff at this store is first aid trained. My dad couldn’t either find any staff from the cleaning team to report that he was ill and was leaving the premises to seek medical help.  He had to drive home while suffering from a heart attack. This could have caused a serious accident or tradegy where people lost lifes. When at home my mother saw how bad he was and rang his G.P. His G.P then rang for an ambulance to take him to hospital  when he was assessed by the paramedic of suffering a heart attack and he was blue lighted straight to James Cook hospital  where he was observed by the wonderful staff from the hospital  that afternoon he had to undertake an operation on his heart and had to have two stents fitted. I am really glad my father received the right treatment and is recovering well with the support of the hospital and his family.  I will never shop in Sainsbury’s ever again and hope a lot more people will follow suit because of the rotten treatment of my father suffered in his hour of need.;2016-11-23T19:28:54+0000;10155473770034377_10155484210879377;95f9f5b8777761655aa989fa1728d0af17709a35;0;Disgusting!

My father is employed to clean the car park and the rest of the outside space of the store. While he was working on the morning 22.11.16 he was suffering from chest pains  he asked a lot of staff that where starting their shift if they could help him as he was ill. Each staff member just walked past my father and give him a dirty look. My dad was suffering a heart attack at the time he was asking for help and if only one member of staff stopped and spoke to him he would have been diagnosed of being ill and sent to hospital a lot earlier.  I assume that staff at this store is first aid trained. My dad couldn’t either find any staff from the cleaning team to report that he was ill and was leaving the premises to seek medical help.  He had to drive home while suffering from a heart attack. This could have caused a serious accident or tradegy where people lost lifes. When at home my mother saw how bad he was and rang his G.P. His G.P then rang for an ambulance to take him to hospital  when he was assessed by the paramedic of suffering a heart attack and he was blue lighted straight to James Cook hospital  where he was observed by the wonderful staff from the hospital  that afternoon he had to undertake an operation on his heart and had to have two stents fitted.

I'm short on time so will just put the complaint here.... You sent me an email asking me to complete a survey, around 15 minutes for 150 nectar points. Originally I wasn't going to bother as that's a ridiculous amount of time for basically very little reward! But I had some spare time and so decided why not, I like sainsbury so 150 points is better than nothing. I spent about 5 minutes then the survey decided that I wasn't the right type of person and said I would get 25 nectar points?????? I referred back to the email and it specifically said all respondents would get 150 points. I certainly wouldn't have bothered doing anything for 25 points!!;2016-11-23T08:54:31+0000;0

Roughly £100 - £130 a week  every week for the past 11 years. As neither me nor my husband drive and now with a 6 week old baby the odd online shop has been a lifesaver and I am normally very happy with the Sainsbury’s service. . However this is the 2nd time I have had reason to complain in the last 4 months. Last night I placed an online order to be delivered today and I am really unhappy with the state my groceries have arrived in. There was a broken custard pot  which I can forgive as accidents do happen. But the custard had leaked out all over the delivery even onto items in other bags. The driver did say he would refund the custard but as I continued to unpack I came across more and more that was covered in custard. In total 14 items had to be washed before I could put them away. In addition to that my sons yoghurts in a different bag had burst or been split too and in a 3rd bag our eggs were broken. Your delivery driver realising that I was becoming more and more unsatisfied only offered the solution of returning my whole order for a full refund. But at this time of night I don’t fancy taking a 6 year old and a 6 week old out to the supermarket to do a week’s shopping I had already done online and already paid for. I didn’t want to return my whole shop… I wanted my whole shop to arrive in a clean usable condition. Too much to ask for???? After your driver left and I continued to unpack my bags I found all my fresh meat looked as though it had been thrown around the store prior to delivery and there was also raw meat products in the same bags as things like cheese and lunch box snacks…. Having worked in the food industry and another main UK supermarket I know this is NOT standard practice nor is it acceptable to store or pack raw meat with other products. Then I found a tray of chicken that has been split open and had raw meat hanging out of it. A red pepper that had clearly been put loose in a bag with heavier items and a great big hole I my Bakewell tart that was for a dinner I am having with my grandparents when they come to visit our new baby (not a very impressive dessert especially without any custard)  broken and snapped asparagus and the list goes on. This is not the kind of service I expect and I will not tolerate it either. I am not stuck with some unusable items  some dirty items and some missing items that I will have to go out and buy making the time I thought I had saved shopping online a complete waste of time. Plus I am going to be out of pocked on a taxi to the store and I dread to think how I will push and buggy and a trolley around the store. All in all this has been a very unpleasant experience. I am really disappointed.;2016-11-22T22:08:15+0000;10155470961389377_10155472416174377;a9a58d7e6bcfb1878b590fdabdbd2192c655f4a0;0;So after initial contact simply asking for my order number nothing but silence from sainsburys...

However this is the 2nd time I have had reason to complain in the last 4 months. Last night I placed an online order to be delivered today and I am really unhappy with the state my groceries have arrived in. There was a broken custard pot  which I can forgive as accidents do happen. But the custard had leaked out all over the delivery even onto items in other bags. The driver did say he would refund the custard but as I continued to unpack I came across more and more that was covered in custard. In total 14 items had to be washed before I could put them away. In addition to that my sons yoghurts in a different bag had burst or been split too and in a 3rd bag our eggs were broken. Your delivery driver realising that I was becoming more and more unsatisfied only offered the solution of returning my whole order for a full refund. But at this time of night I don’t fancy taking a 6 year old and a 6 week old out to the supermarket to do a week’s shopping I had already done online and already paid for. I didn’t want to return my whole shop… I wanted my whole shop to arrive in a clean usable condition. Too much to ask for???? After your driver left and I continued to unpack my bags I found all my fresh meat looked as though it had been thrown around the store prior to delivery and there was also raw meat products in the same bags as things like cheese and lunch box snacks…. Having worked in the food industry and another main UK supermarket I know this is NOT standard practice nor is it acceptable to store or pack raw meat with other products. Then I found a tray of chicken that has been split open and had raw meat hanging out of it. A red pepper that had clearly been put loose in a bag with heavier items and a great big hole I my Bakewell tart that was for a dinner I am having with my grandparents when they come to visit our new baby (not a very impressive dessert especially without any custard)  broken and snapped asparagus and the list goes on. This is not the kind of service I expect and I will not tolerate it either. I am not stuck with some unusable items  some dirty items and some missing items that I will have to go out and buy making the time I thought I had saved shopping online a complete waste of time. Plus I am going to be out of pocked on a taxi to the store and I dread to think how I will push and buggy and a trolley around the store. All in all this has been a very unpleasant experience.

My Boyfriend and I are moving in together this month  and so we had saved up our points all year so we could get some new house stuff. We spoke to a member of staff who told us we could double up £25 to £50 worth of points. After much deliberation  we decided to spend our points on a toaster and kettle. When we then went to redeem our points  another staff member  Rob  was serving. He explained that there was a £40 limit on the points. Rob was really helpful and polite  when scanning the toaster we discovered it was on sale anyway  which only left us with £5 over the £40. Then Rob offered as a gesture of  goodwill  he could take the last £5 off  so we could still get both the items with our points. I want to say thank you so much to Rob  you really made our day! Amazing customer service!;2016-11-22T21:47:49+0000;10155470856214377_10155472138429377;pageowner;0;Hi there Emma, it's great to hear my colleague was so helpful to you!

My little boy took ill on Thursday so I phoned 111 who advised me to take him to the hospital. After seeing my little boy so poorly and being physically sick I jumped in my car and headed for A&E. On the way I noticed my petrol light was on so I pulled in to get fuel. I put £25.00 of fuel in and went to pay to find I hadn t picked my purse up...(Yes I should have checked I had means of payment which I thought was in my little boy bag however in the haste of the moment I must have forgot to pick it up as it wasn t!)  After informing the young women at the counter who was very  helpful  in informing me it was a criminal offence and that she would be calling the police who would Pursue me immediately I told her I had to leave and couldn t wait the 30 mins for her to ring the police and carry out the checks etc. I offered for my husband (who was 78 miles away racing down the m6 to meet me at the hospital) to pay over the phone via our joint account to which she replied it wasn t acceptable and someone needed to bring me the money or my purse. I then attempted to return to my car to get my little boy at which point she very loudly told me I couldn t and had to remain in the shop. Obviously I went to get my little boy out of the car to find him being violently sick everywhere. After returning to the shop and cleaning him up the best I could I told her I would be calling the police to tell them I was having to drive off and told them they would find me at the the A&E department. To the very kind young gentleman who offered to lend me the money to enable me to leave to take my little boy to get the help he needed thank you so much. You really are a life saver! I didn t know this chap from Adam and despite offering him my name  address and tel num he just took my num and said he would call me later - which he did and my husband left the money with the neighbour ready for him to collect.  Once the other women working in the Petrol station saw how poorly my little boy was they were very apologetic asking if they could do anything and apologising for adding stress to what was a very stressful situation for me. I know the staff have protocols to follow and I know I could have been pulling a fast one however they could clearly see I was distressed  upset and hopefully genuine. This is my local store  I hold a nectar card which although I didn t have on me it was in my purse I m sure she could have found me on the system somehow.  After speaking to people about my experience they have all said that if they have done it before or knew of someone who has done it they have had to fill a form in and take payment within 24 hours or face being reported to the police.

I offered to leave my details - name, address, contact details, vehicle reg and even insurance details (god knows why lol on reflection) but she refused and said she was going in the back to call the police. That is why I called the police myself to tell them I was driving off but as they answered the kind chap offered to lend me the money.;2016-11-23T08:31:19+0000;0

My little boy took ill on Thursday so I phoned 111 who advised me to take him to the hospital. After seeing my little boy so poorly and being physically sick I jumped in my car and headed for A&E. On the way I noticed my petrol light was on so I pulled in to get fuel. I put £25.00 of fuel in and went to pay to find I hadn t picked my purse up...(Yes I should have checked I had means of payment which I thought was in my little boy bag however in the haste of the moment I must have forgot to pick it up as it wasn t!)  After informing the young women at the counter who was very  helpful  in informing me it was a criminal offence and that she would be calling the police who would Pursue me immediately I told her I had to leave and couldn t wait the 30 mins for her to ring the police and carry out the checks etc. I offered for my husband (who was 78 miles away racing down the m6 to meet me at the hospital) to pay over the phone via our joint account to which she replied it wasn t acceptable and someone needed to bring me the money or my purse. I then attempted to return to my car to get my little boy at which point she very loudly told me I couldn t and had to remain in the shop. Obviously I went to get my little boy out of the car to find him being violently sick everywhere. After returning to the shop and cleaning him up the best I could I told her I would be calling the police to tell them I was having to drive off and told them they would find me at the the A&E department. To the very kind young gentleman who offered to lend me the money to enable me to leave to take my little boy to get the help he needed thank you so much. You really are a life saver! I didn t know this chap from Adam and despite offering him my name  address and tel num he just took my num and said he would call me later - which he did and my husband left the money with the neighbour ready for him to collect.  Once the other women working in the Petrol station saw how poorly my little boy was they were very apologetic asking if they could do anything and apologising for adding stress to what was a very stressful situation for me. I know the staff have protocols to follow and I know I could have been pulling a fast one however they could clearly see I was distressed  upset and hopefully genuine. This is my local store  I hold a nectar card which although I didn t have on me it was in my purse I m sure she could have found me on the system somehow.  After speaking to people about my experience they have all said that if they have done it before or knew of someone who has done it they have had to fill a form in and take payment within 24 hours or face being reported to the police. Thankfully after being on a enebaliser for 2 days and then oxygen for a further 24 hours  2 chest X-rays  inhalers and antibiotics my little boy had a severe chest infection and bronchitis.

My little boy took ill on Thursday so I phoned 111 who advised me to take him to the hospital. After seeing my little boy so poorly and being physically sick I jumped in my car and headed for A&E. On the way I noticed my petrol light was on so I pulled in to get fuel. I put £25.00 of fuel in and went to pay to find I hadn t picked my purse up...(Yes I should have checked I had means of payment which I thought was in my little boy bag however in the haste of the moment I must have forgot to pick it up as it wasn t!)  After informing the young women at the counter who was very  helpful  in informing me it was a criminal offence and that she would be calling the police who would Pursue me immediately I told her I had to leave and couldn t wait the 30 mins for her to ring the police and carry out the checks etc. I offered for my husband (who was 78 miles away racing down the m6 to meet me at the hospital) to pay over the phone via our joint account to which she replied it wasn t acceptable and someone needed to bring me the money or my purse. I then attempted to return to my car to get my little boy at which point she very loudly told me I couldn t and had to remain in the shop. Obviously I went to get my little boy out of the car to find him being violently sick everywhere. After returning to the shop and cleaning him up the best I could I told her I would be calling the police to tell them I was having to drive off and told them they would find me at the the A&E department. To the very kind young gentleman who offered to lend me the money to enable me to leave to take my little boy to get the help he needed thank you so much. You really are a life saver! I didn t know this chap from Adam and despite offering him my name  address and tel num he just took my num and said he would call me later - which he did and my husband left the money with the neighbour ready for him to collect.  Once the other women working in the Petrol station saw how poorly my little boy was they were very apologetic asking if they could do anything and apologising for adding stress to what was a very stressful situation for me. I know the staff have protocols to follow and I know I could have been pulling a fast one however they could clearly see I was distressed  upset and hopefully genuine. This is my local store  I hold a nectar card which although I didn t have on me it was in my purse I m sure she could have found me on the system somehow.  After speaking to people about my experience they have all said that if they have done it before or knew of someone who has done it they have had to fill a form in and take payment within 24 hours or face being reported to the police. Thankfully after being on a enebaliser for 2 days and then oxygen for a further 24 hours  2 chest X-rays  inhalers and antibiotics my little boy had a severe chest infection and bronchitis. Thankfully after his 2nd chest X-ray this morning it was confirmed he didn t have pneumonia.  We are now finally home but I would just like to show my sheer disgust to the young women in the petrol station that morning. I know I was 100% at fault for having no means of payment on me but there was certainly a better way of dealing with the matter in question!

Firstly thank you for your reply it is much appreciated. Unfortunately I wasn't given a receipt as I handed the lady the money that was lent to me in the back store room and then shot off to the hospital. From my phone records I rang my husband at 7.30am to ask him to pay, rang the police at 7.33am and was back on the road and on the phone to my husband at 7.45am so the incident would have taken place just before 7.30am. There was only 2 staff working from what I recall seeing a young women in her 20's or early 30's with blonde hair and a older women with short dark hair - who was very helpful in helping me with my little boy in the store cupboard and was very apologetic.;2016-11-23T08:25:12+0000;0

I was dubious as My daughter cut her hand on one of your knives which had been given to us as child friendly but in fact was not suitable for children  this was about 6 months ago and following a complaint  which was resolved  I was assured there is children s cutlery available in your family friendly café s. I was surprised today  when again we asked for children s cutlery  to be presented with the same adult cutlery as before. This is sharper than your usual cutlery as it s for people who are disabled. I challenged staff and was disappointed to be told this is what he d been told to give to children and was the only cutlery available for them. When will children s safety be put first!?!

None of our food waste go to landfills, instead it is donated, turned into animal feed or used in anaerobic digestion.

We d finished our shopping in your Bretton  Peterborough store and my mum and myself were getting my son s coat on. My daughter was stood next to us waiting for her coat to be put on. We hear a huge thud and turn to find my daughter flat out on the floor deathly white. We grabbed her off the floor and she started screaming much to our relief! The security guard near by saw what happened and came over to check she was ok and called for first aid. He waited with us until someone came. A lady called Sue appeared and checked her head  I m not 100% sure if she was first aid but still took us to the pharmacy for my daughter to be checked over. He gave us advice about signs of concussion and we bought some paracetamol to give her straight away. Another lady appeared with a bag of ice from the fish counter for my daughter s head. My daughter was obviously still very upset  so Sue kindly went to find her some chocolate buttons which she gave her for free. And then asked us to go sit in the cafe and got us all a coffee for free too and asked us to stay for a while to make sure my daughter was ok. Sue took my details for the accident book and has said she s going to ring me tomorrow afternoon to check my daughter is still ok.

We d finished our shopping in your Bretton  Peterborough store and my mum and myself were getting my son s coat on. My daughter was stood next to us waiting for her coat to be put on. We hear a huge thud and turn to find my daughter flat out on the floor deathly white. We grabbed her off the floor and she started screaming much to our relief! The security guard near by saw what happened and came over to check she was ok and called for first aid. He waited with us until someone came. A lady called Sue appeared and checked her head  I m not 100% sure if she was first aid but still took us to the pharmacy for my daughter to be checked over. He gave us advice about signs of concussion and we bought some paracetamol to give her straight away. Another lady appeared with a bag of ice from the fish counter for my daughter s head. My daughter was obviously still very upset  so Sue kindly went to find her some chocolate buttons which she gave her for free. And then asked us to go sit in the cafe and got us all a coffee for free too and asked us to stay for a while to make sure my daughter was ok. Sue took my details for the accident book and has said she s going to ring me tomorrow afternoon to check my daughter is still ok.

The lady was called Namb and she showed an amazing level of customer service. A slightly older lady was in front of me and she was struggling with her shopping. The checkout lady took her time to help the customer load her shopping and then organise and pack it while explaining what she was putting in each bag so the customer knew where everything was when she got home. Your employee apologised to me several times for the wait  but it was just lovely to see someone displaying such care and patience for a customer. Sainsbury s  if you hand out employee of the month awards  this member of staff deserves one  she is a credit to your company.

Thank you so much - I know such generosity and thoughtfulness will be much appreciated by Alison and her family.;2016-11-21T21:27:40+0000;10155467256959377_10155469088174377;pageowner;0;Hi Sarah, that's so lovely to hear.

I know this looks scary, but the actual correct amount of points have been taken off. To ensure our Double up promotion works correctly, Nectar add an extra 4000 points to your card, then remove 8000. This is to ensure you are only really spending 4000 of our own points.

I salute those who try to raise alarms in the early stages of potentially disastrous practices, but unfortunately, it would seem that people in general only start to become aware when it is almost too late.  That said it doesn't mean that we should just thrown in the towel and do nothing at all.  It is a pity we have allowed 'big business' to operate with impunity throughout the world - all in the search for profit above what is ethical and sensible.  We are allowing moneygrabbers to mortgage the futures of our children and grandchildren.

We dont need it in our diet in the western world when we have other options,  there are many people that do not eat fish for ethical reasons so yes some people are actualy doing thier bit before it's too late ... and you could too Kev.;2016-11-22T00:26:04+0000;0

Not buying it only serves to make the deaths of other sea creatures that get caught up in the tuna nets worth even less as well as wasting perfectly good food into the bargain. I find it amazing how we all get so  conservation aware when the deeds have already been done. Just for one time I would like to see conservation groups start their campaigns BEFORE its too late to make a difference instead of getting all precious when its too late;2016-11-21T19:59:04+0000;3

My girlfriend and I are strictly vegan  due to a combination of dietary requirements and moral reasons. We often shop in our local sainsburys store in bedford and are very happy with the range on offer. Our particular favourite is your  free from  pesto which we eat a couple of times a week. Last week we did our regular shop and picked up our usual pesto  from the  free from   aisle along with pasta and a selection of vegetables.  This evening we decided to roast the veg and stir the pesto in. Not thinking we had to check the jar  we proceeded as usual  chopping up a variety of veg and adding the sauce. To our horror (luckily before we had eaten it) we discovered that the pesto which we had purchased was the original variety  containing cheese.

We often shop in our local sainsburys store in bedford and are very happy with the range on offer. Our particular favourite is your  free from  pesto which we eat a couple of times a week. Last week we did our regular shop and picked up our usual pesto  from the  free from   aisle along with pasta and a selection of vegetables.  This evening we decided to roast the veg and stir the pesto in. Not thinking we had to check the jar  we proceeded as usual  chopping up a variety of veg and adding the sauce. To our horror (luckily before we had eaten it) we discovered that the pesto which we had purchased was the original variety  containing cheese. Not only are we having to start cooking again but we have also wasted roughly ten pounds on ingredients that will now be thrown away.  We thoroughly enjoyed shopping regularly in your stores but this evening s events have been a shock. If  for example  I had an allergy to an ingredient in the pesto which we purchased  the end result could have much worse. We look forward to your reply  yours faithfully   James Dudley.;2016-11-21T19:38:56+0000;10155466978744377_10155478211894377;a8a16a74fc923e3b557b5f7f1300dd9bea97f0d1;0;;2016-11-25T04:50:04+0000;3

We wholeheartedly share Greenpeace's goal of improving fishing practices across the world, which makes it all the more disappointing to be the sole focus of this campaign. John West is working with WWF to drive up its sustainability status by 2018 and we are closely monitoring the progress. We have been absolutely clear that If targets are not met, we will reconsider our relationship with JW. But we know it's more effective to work with businesses to tackle issues rather than simply turning our backs. Holly;2016-11-21T20:42:51+0000;0

It was the 3rd time I have had this sandwich and until today it has been adequate for what you might expect for £1.10. However  today I bit into the same sandwich which was both dry and chewy  and seemed to be made of thicker bread with less filing. I am extremely disappointed as your lack of vegetarian sandwiches has already lead me to seek lunch elsewhere but today I decided that Sainsbury s sandwiches cannot be trusted. My feelings have been hurt deeply as I don t feel that you take the lunch needs of vegetarians seriously enough 😕;2016-11-21T13:39:48+0000;10155465950669377_10155466507109377;pageowner;0;How disappointing for you.

At the moment, the Café pies come from a small supplier who hand make our delicious pies for us.  At the moment they aren’t set up to make the volumes it would take to supply the aisle with the same pies as well. They do make some pies for our deli counters such as a turkey, bacon and stuffing slicing pie, and a cheese and bacon tartlet so we hope you’ll give those a try if you’re a fan.

Can you give me some more details on how you feel that you're limited? While there is a £40 limit, you are only converting £20 of points to get this. If you wanted to buy a £100 item then yes, you would need to pay £60 towards it, however you've made an extra saving of £20 thanks to the bonus points we've offered for free as part of the event. We provided this event so that customers can double their points they've accrued over the year and we're always looking for feedback we can use for future promotions so I'd be happy to forward on any that you have.

Please be assured we pride ourselves on having good supplier relationships and work with them to ensure our high standards are met. Ethical trading is a key part of this relationship. We require all our suppliers to meet the Sainsbury’s Code of Conduct for Ethical Trade which is based on the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code for ethical sourcing. Our code covers 12 key principles, and this includes no child labour.  Our suppliers are required to show compliance against this code and to provide evidence of continuous improvement in worker welfare. Suppliers must have in place their own code of conduct, policies and systems to manage ethical trade, and be able to report their progress to us. We also risk assess all our suppliers and conduct regular, independent, third party ethical audits where required. I hope this puts your mind at ease when purchasing these products from us.

Has the recipe changed?   They seem overly sweet and the sugar isn t helping the baking process as they are also more crunchy than soft cookie. Which also isn t helped if they are overbaked.  Plus there are less white chocolate bits in and as for the raspberry - even David Attenborough would have a hard time finding it 😢 They were the only thing making my Uni assignments bearable but now in my last year I can t have anything distracting my work so sadly might have to search elsewhere for something to replace them.   Or can you change the recipe back?🙏🏻;2016-11-20T18:05:53+0000;10155463043959377_10155465472009377;d7f485a5061df80523ec819cb7ed48ba02645d44;1;That's the problem.

'Tesco and Waitrose have committed to remove John West tuna from their shelves if they don’t clean up their act. But Sainsbury’s are refusing to do the same.  Earlier this year, the Greenpeace ship Esperanza travelled to the Indian Ocean to investigate unsustainable fishing practices. They found destructive fishing devices (that kill sharks and turtles) belonging to Thai Union, the company who owns John West.  Meanwhile in the UK, hundreds of you took action in Sainsbury’s stores up and down the country. You’ve visited your local branches, called Sainsbury’s customer services and posted on their social media channels. Over 100,000 emails have been sent to Sainsbury’s CEO – the issue was even raised at their AGM!

The process for redeeming points with the Double Up promotion has changed this year. To process the redemption via Sainsbury's till systems they will initially have to remove the full value of points and then refund half the points back instantly. However, due to a technical issue, it is now taking up to 72 hours to refund the points. Sorry for any inconvenience caused. Craig;2016-11-20T14:04:19+0000;0

Congratulations to Sainsbury s for taking the plunge and introducing vinyl albums in your stores  with my nectar double up I had already earmarked several albums to restart and enhance my collection. I went in store and looked at what I wanted to buy  and I was a little concerned as to the way they were merchandised. Earlier this year I was in your Exeter store and saw you were selling vinyl there  but these were displayed in bins where you could flip happily through   the ones displayed in your Fareham Broadcut store were placed overlapping on shelves no wider than two inches wide...  when I saw it I thought that this is a disaster waiting to happen  and sure enough it did within two minutes someone came along picked a record from one end and twenty plus albums fell to the floor  I helped to put them back on the shelf and looked through carefully taking albums out and looking at the track listing. I did notice some damage on the David Bowie albums which were my target to buy on the double up. A week later I am in and looking again at the albums  all the damaged albums are still there on the shelf  I sorted them out and took them over to the service desk and explained the damage to the assistant and as far as I could see they put them out of the way. I was in again on Thursday to choose my albums for the double up  all the albums I was going to choose were badly damaged  they were hunky dory lp  and Aladdin sane by bowie  and welcome to the pleasure dome by frankie goes to Hollywood..... I chose other lps that were undamaged. By different artistes. Not Happy.... The point I am making is that these albums are a premium price and are being treated like bags of spuds  what was worse was the albums I had given to the assistant as damaged were back out on display STILL DAMAGED!!! Come on get your act sorted out  get your merchandising sorted out and make sure that if damaged goods are re-merchandised they are reduced in price to reflect the damage and state the damage..... I shop in broadcut on a regular basis and I will be raising this issue with the store management as an unacceptable practice.;2016-11-19T22:22:16+0000;10155460202504377_10155462332414377;pageowner;0;Hi Kev!

Earlier this year I was in your Exeter store and saw you were selling vinyl there  but these were displayed in bins where you could flip happily through   the ones displayed in your Fareham Broadcut store were placed overlapping on shelves no wider than two inches wide...  when I saw it I thought that this is a disaster waiting to happen  and sure enough it did within two minutes someone came along picked a record from one end and twenty plus albums fell to the floor  I helped to put them back on the shelf and looked through carefully taking albums out and looking at the track listing. I did notice some damage on the David Bowie albums which were my target to buy on the double up. A week later I am in and looking again at the albums  all the damaged albums are still there on the shelf  I sorted them out and took them over to the service desk and explained the damage to the assistant and as far as I could see they put them out of the way. I was in again on Thursday to choose my albums for the double up  all the albums I was going to choose were badly damaged  they were hunky dory lp  and Aladdin sane by bowie  and welcome to the pleasure dome by frankie goes to Hollywood..... I chose other lps that were undamaged. By different artistes. Not Happy.... The point I am making is that these albums are a premium price and are being treated like bags of spuds  what was worse was the albums I had given to the assistant as damaged were back out on display STILL DAMAGED!!! Come on get your act sorted out  get your merchandising sorted out and make sure that if damaged goods are re-merchandised they are reduced in price to reflect the damage and state the damage..... I shop in broadcut on a regular basis and I will be raising this issue with the store management as an unacceptable practice.;2016-11-19T22:22:16+0000;10155460202504377_10155469891714377;pageowner;0;Hi Kev, We have had a response from the store and the buying team. They have taken action to reduce the risk of titles falling from the bay and therefore getting damaged. This involves implementing an additional plastic insert to the left hand side of the fixture, which holds in the titles should they be pulled forward as described below.

I have just been onto the Sainsbury s customer care line to complain that their St Phillips Bristol is now closed for refurbishment.  I explained it would have been nice if the store had actually told me it would be closing when I was there during the week previously.   They apologised and said that I needed to look on the Sainsbury website to check if a store is open.  After #lol “I said she must be joking  you are expecting me to check your every time I want to go shopping?”. Realising that was not such a clever answer the apologised again and said that we make a note and let their internal teams know. I then asked what does that mean and they just repeated the statement.  I was on the call for over 15 minutes and they never even asked for my name.  I estimate that thousands of customers have turned up to the store only to find it closed.  How can a supermarket chain treat their loyal customers this way.;2016-11-19T12:03:06+0000;10155458520284377_10155459006369377;pageowner;0;Hi Martin, apologies for all the confusion.

I was ordering Christmas presents for family and had pre-arranged which items I would buy for their children so had to be organised. I can honestly say  it was the worst and most time consuming order I have ever made. I thought it would be easier and quicker to buy the items online  with the ease of walking instore and picking it all up at once.  Unfortunately  due to an error on your systems  my payment wasn t processed. I wasn t contacted to say there was an issue with my order and so I went in store to collect my items before I was informed of your error. By this point your event had finished and so I was directed to your website  for the customer service team. When I spoke to them I was told that they could offer an evoucher for the saving I would have received  however all the items online were out of stock. So I would have to look for the items myself in store. And so the evoucher would prove pointless. I requested that I have the items located so I could pick them up in store  which I was told would happen. So I emailed over my most convenient stores and then received an email with the evoucher not long after. After a week of hearing nothing else about the instore stock  I emailed again to ask why I hadn t heard anything and was told that I had received the evoucher  but that wasn t the point!  This is the worst customer service I have ever received. I m fed up now. I have been running round in circles for 2 weeks and I just want this fixed as soon as possible. Are you able to offer any help  because I am at my wits end?

Usually for staple foodstuffs such as milk (Cravendale)  Cava  Gin  Rose Lemonade  artisan bread and my all time FAVOURITE  cheese sauce to dip nachos in.  Imagine my disappointment  stress and anger when 9/10 times they ve sold out of cheese sauce! The other flavour sauces are NEVER SOLD OUT.   Only this very evening I filled my bag for life with Cravendale and Cava but found the cheese sauce stock completely exhausted. I m flipping exhausted I can tell you!!   It s like a falcon punch to my shriveled ovaries  having been trapped in servitude all day  only to be laughed at by am empty cheese sauce shelf.   I just wanted one measly pot of cheese sauce 😥😥😥  Please have a word in the ear of the procurement department  responsible for the provision of stock  to ensure that evening visitors are not cheated out of a cheese sauce supper by daytime muggle shoppers.  Thanking you in advance  for ensuring a healthy stock of cheese sauce ensues forthwith.

I was in the queue  and the customer two in front of myself was a young male with tattoos on his neck and arms. A very smart  well dressed young guy not that this should make any difference. Anyway once he had left the till  the customer in front said  oh did you see those horrible tattoos . The cashier (Jill I think she was called) replied oh I know  weren t they dreadful. The two of them went on to have a conversation about this customer (who had just spent money in your store) in a horrible and judgemental way  stating the tattoos look ugly and make him look dirty (with absolutely no effort to be quiet). The conversation then went on to how the cashier thought all tattoos are horrible  particularly ok girls. Now I don t care what anyone thinks of my personal choices  but they should care about those either but I have tattoos myself. The first conversation would have definitely caused offence to the customer and the second comments could have quite easily offended myself. They didn t  but it s angered me and disgusted me. I work in retail myself as an area manager for Aldi  and if I thought for once moment that a staff member would speak to a customer to blatantly about another staff I d be disgusted.  I reported this to customer services at the time in store  who did agree it wasn t acceptable however I have come home and got angrier and angrier about this. I saw the customer outside and almost told him but I didn t actually want him to know what small minded people had said about him.;2016-11-18T19:10:42+0000;10155455945879377_10155456165099377;a5344d51015270b6d18279bd840221738a5b3665;0;That's disgusting behaviour!

Every tiny reduction in plastic packaging is useful. So you might think I m daft but ... take a look at the Sainsbury s extra care soft toothbrush. You could HALVE the plastic in that wrapper: it doesn t need a plastic bubble both sides  just 1 transparent side backed with flat card. And how many more products could reduce plastic packaging  especially in food? Please. This is important. Remember how consumers and producers reduced and largely got rid of damaging CFC propellants. It s our world and it s at tipping point *now*.;2016-11-18T12:57:16+0000;10155454807594377_10155454832224377;pageowner;0;Hi Chloe, Please see this link http://bit.ly/1CTYoI5 This shows what we do to help the environment.

I was at the Woodhall Farm Sainsbury s in Hemel Hempstead with my mum about an hour ago when I started to feel REALLY faint. This is common for me  I m generally pretty faint or lightheaded if I haven t eaten (which I hadn t). I can usually breathe through it until I can get round to eating something  but this time around I couldn t. I ended up laying myself down outside the store  as sitting upright was too difficult.  Amazingly the first person to approach me was a paramedic! I never caught his name but I d love to thank him for keeping me calm before the Sainsbury s staff came out.  I can t express enough gratitude to the staff members that talked me through my fainting episode  helped me off the cold ground  brought me inside  fed me tea and toast in a quiet area of the store and chatted with me until I felt loads better.  I especially want to thank Natalie who got me through the entire thing while so wonderfully friendly. As I felt better and got up to leave with my mum  Natalie gave me a huge box of shortbread biscuits and told me to eat! I can t get over how generous Natalie and the rest of the staff were (in my dizzy state I forgot their names!) and I wanted to be able to thank them properly. Sainsbury s have incredible customer service  especially at Woodhall Farm where it is truly like a family there within their staff  and that should never be overlooked.  I ll definitely be back in there to thank them all personally. The shortbread biscuits have worked a treat!  Thank you so much  it may not feel like it to you  but what you did for me was nothing short of heroic.  Biiiiig love.;2016-11-18T11:45:19+0000;10155454662899377_10155454710714377;pageowner;0;Hello Jennifer! Aww I'm glad your well. I have contacted the store, they will pass this onto Natalie.

Checkout Staff are the Customer Service face of the store and often the last opportunity for the store to make a positive experience for a customer before they leave the store. They are there to provide a good service, which includes informing customers of any promotions or policies currently operating, especially this time of the year. I worked the checkouts of another major grocery retailer for over 10 yrs and this kind of thing is part of the job of a checkout assistant.;2016-11-17T21:14:25+0000;0

I had an email over a month ago , giving me the dates of this promotion, followed by 3  more over the past week, reminding me, telling me how many points I currently have, and what they are worth. My local Sainsburys  has had brochures out at the store entrance, for about 10days, surrounded by purple balloons, very eye catching. In addition many members of staff  have been wearing purple t shirts with Nectar  logos  The double up   event  takes place a couple of times a year, at about the same times , so this one is always around the 16/18th of November, same as last year. You have been unlucky to miss out on all of this information,;2016-11-17T23:10:03+0000;0

It is sad that they don t seem to see the irony of their own advertising  bearing in mind they will no doubt have most stores working extended hours leading up to Christmas  closing only for Christmas Day  and then re-opening on Boxing Day.

You really need to look at your system for double up! To only be able to double £20 to £40 as a maximum and have to do each voucher in a single transaction was an absolute bloody nightmare! I had my 1 yr old daughter kicking off a rude customer service agent on the desk who didn t know what she was doing and I had £85 that I was changing up across clothing and technology.

You can get your vouchers, for your double up points in advance, this has been possible for a week now, and then put the  voucher and item  through the tills with your shopping, or you can do the whole process at the customer service till.

Had a call from my Nan asking if I had £10 or more worth in nectar points as Sainsbury s have a  double up  scheme through nectar and she wanted a blouse and knew she d technically get it free if she could use my nectar points. I thought why not I can also get myself a clothing item considering I ll have double the amount of money.  I went to Sainsbury s westhoughton  went over to the customer service desk and asked for my double points in clothes vouchers. The lady at the desk gave me two vouchers the top one being a £10 clothing voucher so I assumed I wouldn t have to check the second one underneath as that should also be a £10 clothing voucher as well making it a total of £20 in clothing vouchers hence your double up nectar points scheme. We picked up what we wanted and made our way to the check out  I automatically handed over both vouchers to my disbelief have one of them handed back to me  I read on the voucher it said   £18 off delivery  on the voucher. To this point I was confused paid the lady at the till only getting £10 off the clothes instead of £20. I asked my Nan surely I should have had £20 in vouchers not £10 as it s a double up scheme. So we went back to the customer service desk to be served by the same lady. Mucking us about was an understatement  first of all she was pretty much accusing me of lying claiming I only ask for £10 in clothing vouchers to which I asked her why would I ask for £10 when I asked for the double points scheme! She then went to refund one of the items to then give us another £10 voucher but the item she refunded us was under £10 and asked if I could go and get a chocolate bar or a packet of crisps to round up the amount to £10 to which I had to run around looking for a couple of kitkats to make it a pound so it was rounded to £10. She scanned them and said oh sorry you can t have these with the voucher as it s clothing which I would have thought she would have already knew that anyway to then ask me for a £1 to then refund it and then she was asking me to go back in the clothing department and look for something else that s a £1 so she could allow me to buy my item back and then refund this £1 again! So there s me running around like an idiot to try and find something that was a £1 in the clothing department that I didn t want to get in the first place just so I could get it refunded to then get my item back!  So Sainsbury s I recommend that in future you educate your staff on how to double up points/money  make sure they check what they have printed off for their customers and maybe not muck their customers about making them running all over the shop floors! 😡😡😡😡;2016-11-16T11:38:29+0000;10155447334234377_10155447378709377;82ef7fa29b101940aa65e3a66be4acb779285a35;0;Wow;2016-11-16T12:10:02+0000;1

She then went to refund one of the items to then give us another £10 voucher but the item she refunded us was under £10 and asked if I could go and get a chocolate bar or a packet of crisps to round up the amount to £10 to which I had to run around looking for a couple of kitkats to make it a pound so it was rounded to £10. She scanned them and said oh sorry you can t have these with the voucher as it s clothing which I would have thought she would have already knew that anyway to then ask me for a £1 to then refund it and then she was asking me to go back in the clothing department and look for something else that s a £1 so she could allow me to buy my item back and then refund this £1 again! So there s me running around like an idiot to try and find something that was a £1 in the clothing department that I didn t want to get in the first place just so I could get it refunded to then get my item back!  So Sainsbury s I recommend that in future you educate your staff on how to double up points/money  make sure they check what they have printed off for their customers and maybe not muck their customers about making them running all over the shop floors! 😡😡😡😡;2016-11-16T11:38:29+0000;10155447334234377_10155447470424377;f65fedfdaf3c76b4dc548987ae1afb5fba504ae4;1;I have spoke to one of your Colleagues on private message.;2016-11-16T13:04:58+0000;0

Had a call from my Nan asking if I had £10 or more worth in nectar points as Sainsbury s have a  double up  scheme through nectar and she wanted a blouse and knew she d technically get it free if she could use my nectar points. I thought why not I can also get myself a clothing item considering I ll have double the amount of money.  I went to Sainsbury s westhoughton  went over to the customer service desk and asked for my double points in clothes vouchers. The lady at the desk gave me two vouchers the top one being a £10 clothing voucher so I assumed I wouldn t have to check the second one underneath as that should also be a £10 clothing voucher as well making it a total of £20 in clothing vouchers hence your double up nectar points scheme. We picked up what we wanted and made our way to the check out  I automatically handed over both vouchers to my disbelief have one of them handed back to me  I read on the voucher it said   £18 off delivery  on the voucher. To this point I was confused paid the lady at the till only getting £10 off the clothes instead of £20. I asked my Nan surely I should have had £20 in vouchers not £10 as it s a double up scheme. So we went back to the customer service desk to be served by the same lady. Mucking us about was an understatement  first of all she was pretty much accusing me of lying claiming I only ask for £10 in clothing vouchers to which I asked her why would I ask for £10 when I asked for the double points scheme!

We understand that Christmas is an important time of year for everyone to celebrate with their families. Serving our customers wherever and whenever they want is at the heart of what we do. For the past six years we have had our stores open in order to serve our customers who wish to shop with us on this day. It is an extremely popular day for us and always has a high demand for us to be open – last year there were over two million transactions in our stores on Boxing Day alone. We know that everyone would love more time to spend with their families and we do accommodate to this as much as we can. Gabby.;2016-11-16T10:53:04+0000;0

Hardly worth the cost of being open. I dare you to start a trend by closing on boxing day. People won't starve due to a 2 day closure and you will ultimately end up with happy staff. A happy staff is a productive one.  The only people who truly NEED to work are those in emergency services and care. (which for the record, is where i work) Why help in making society a 24 hour year round entity?;2016-11-16T11:42:06+0000;2

As a business we are required to satisfy a demand when there is one but I can empathise with those who would rather be at home. What I would like to do is log your feedback properly with the right people so it can be considered in the future. What store do you usually shop in? Just for logging purposes.

It's his choice to go that extra mile and he likely does it because he wants to. If it was me I would not want a group of people trying to make themselves feel better by chucking a £1000 at me. The whole campaign is just weird quite frankly. He's won their employer of the year award, (which you have no idea of the prize given) was given reward vouchers and some chocolates. What do you want them to give him? Get in the real world.;2016-11-16T09:45:38+0000;0

It's a nice thing to do for someone to show their appreciation. Not because it makes them feel better. And so what if he's already won an award. He shouldn't get further recognition? That's it? He's had an award let's leave him to it? Right. And bosses of large multi national companies don't get huge, overinflated bonus every year for ""just doing their job"". Yes they do.

Yesterday I went to the large sainsburys in crawley and ended up purchasing some clothes for my little boy  I could nt really afford them but I decided to use my 27.50 of points. No where in the store was there anything saying it was double points  not one poster or anything advertising it..

Could have been summed up with a simple 'No'. I like the sentiment of the advert but I'm not sure that it's a particularly clever move. They are encouraging their customers to spend more time with their families yet their staff will be made to work it. I suspect that there are very few if any colleagues that would be granted permission to take extra time off at Christmas.;2016-11-15T10:15:30+0000;5

Serving our customers wherever and whenever they want is at the heart of what we do. We have been open in selected stores on Boxing Day for the last 6 years and our sales data shows us that more and more people are shopping with us on Boxing Day – last year there were over two million transactions in our stores on Boxing Day alone. Where there is a demand, we will always try to meet this to better serve our customers. Steve.;2016-11-15T12:58:35+0000;0

I expected exactly this response. I know that if your doors are open, people will come, but isn't it time that one of the 'big 6' tried something different? Would it really make that much difference to your profits if you didn't open for just one extra day over the holidays? If you lead, the others will follow and your staff and their families will get 'the greatest gift of christmas' that you so beautifully portray in your advert. Of course, Sainsbury's won't change their opening hours because of my Facebook post but it's worth a try...after all we all call it 'giraffe bread' now...;2016-11-15T13:07:30+0000;2

Obviously these decisions are made a little higher up in the chain but what I can do is log your feedback with the company. You make a good point about the giraffe bread, and it's feedback like this which can help facilitate change in the long run.

It's true about hotel workers, I used to work in one but that's a different story! I think the main thing to take away from this is that as a business we need to balance the needs of the employees and the demands of the customer. Due to a few different factors including Boxing Day sales and the rise of capitalist consumerism there is a large demand for stores to be open on Boxing Day. I'm not trying to justify it, and it's definitely a much bigger issue than individual supermarkets but I hope that I've been able to alleviate some of your concerns.

Very hypocritical of your company to release a christmas advert about the best gift of all, time with families. Something you seem not to place any value for this with your own staff. The only reason people need to shop on boxing day, is because retailers decided to open. How can your staff have valuable family time with just one day off. John Lewis and Waitrose close, because they value their staff, and realise there is no need to open boxing day. I think sainsburys need to practice what they preach. I personally feel ALL retailers should remain closed on boxing day. Retail nowadays are the ultimate scrooges when it comes to their staff;2016-11-14T21:13:48+0000;6

Don t get me wrong I LOVE James Corden however the warm Christmas message I have become used to just wasn t there.   I m sure from your First World War advert of 2014 you understand how much of an impact you can make from your Christmas advert. The message you bring can help make our world a greater place by raising money and awareness. Unfortunately you haven t done that this year.   I have written you a Christmas advert for 2017 that I hope you enjoy.... let s bring awareness to homelessness next Christmas.   It opens up with people shopping  laughing  having coffee through the window of the shop.  A song is sung all accoutically and slow. There s a little girl about 8 years old but she isn t looking at the bright christmas tree or the toys in the shop  she sees the homeless people  the people who are really struggling.   The little girl comes home and writes her list to santa  Dear santa  for christmas this year please help people who don t have homes  the parents see the list and are overcome with emotion.   The shot goes to a few homeless people waking up to cards sitting on their rucksack/trolley. They open the cards and tears roll down their cheeks.   Back to the little girl  she s setting the table  opening the last window in her advent calender. She s sad  she got a bike for christmas but her wish didn t come true.   The doorbell rings.   She perks up... who could this be?  In come the homeless people and she had the biggest smile on her face.   There s a montage of eating christmas dinner  pulling crackers and general warm happiness.  The advert ends with the little girl looking out the window to see Santa s sleigh flying past and she whispers  thanks Santa    Christmas is for sharing   Now obviously I am not a writer but you could do something to help raise awareness. When you release that advert you could make sure every store has a donation box for food banks  the song sung in the advert could be a charity single raising money for a homeless charity  sell hats/scarves/gloves cheap to be donated.   You have the power to raise awareness with your Christmas advert... Use it.

One of the best Christmases I had was on one of the wards at GOSH, bought home the true meaning of Christmas and made me feel grateful, not only at what I had but also being lucky enough to be part of the families celebrations. Your idea is fab though, maybe they'll bring you in to do next year's one.;2016-11-14T13:28:29+0000;0

There s a montage of eating christmas dinner  pulling crackers and general warm happiness.  The advert ends with the little girl looking out the window to see Santa s sleigh flying past and she whispers  thanks Santa    Christmas is for sharing   Now obviously I am not a writer but you could do something to help raise awareness. When you release that advert you could make sure every store has a donation box for food banks  the song sung in the advert could be a charity single raising money for a homeless charity  sell hats/scarves/gloves cheap to be donated.   You have the power to raise awareness with your Christmas advert... Use it.   Thanks for reading  Gemma (former Sainsburys employee);2016-11-14T11:36:12+0000;10155438205704377_10155445706114377;86a210131f8f18b3b148bf502793c2154f8bdc37;0;I quite liked this one this year its not as straightforward a message as previous years but really all it is meaning is that people fuss over what to get each other for Christmas yet just being able have all your family together to spend time with each other is all you need. Christmas is too commercialized these days! But I LOVE the idea of yours for next year! Xx;2016-11-15T22:42:29+0000;0

I am writing to inform you that I will no longer be shopping at Sainsbury’s until your company withdraws all advertising from The Daily Mail newspaper. I am disappointed to hear that you will not reconsider your advertising policy unlike the Co-Operative Supermarket  who are currently reviewing its advertising partners due to concerns from customers. Lego also announced on Saturday that they will withdraw their advertising campaigns in The Daily Mail which has gained the company a huge amount of respect and gratitude from its customers. Thousands of positive comments can be read on their Facebook page and Twitter account. What a great endorsement for Lego!  The Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday’s editorial have behaved despicably in recent years by promoting messages of hatred towards vulnerable and minority groups.  Their style of reporting is deliberately meant to create fear and resentment; very little of what is printed in this publication is based on fact. For example  their recent coverage of child refugees being transported from the Calais “jungle” involved the use of an inaccurate age-recognition app in order to determine their ages with the implication being that grown adults were pretending to be minors in order to gain access to the UK. Such treatment of young people is completely inappropriate  not to mention the fact that it negates The UN Convention on The Rights of The Child. Additionally  as a school teacher who works with many young people who happen to be asylum seekers and refugees  I find this treatment of young people personally upsetting.  It is not only ethnic minorities that are victim to the publication’s despicable treatment. In 2013  courts ruled that school teacher  Lucy Meadows committed suicide in March earlier that year  as a result of her gender reassignment being outed by the national press. Michael Singleton  the coroner for Blackburn  Hyndburn and Rossendale  described the Daily Mail as having carried out a campaign of  ridicule and humiliation  as well as character assassination  of the young woman. The style of reporting adopted by the paper is actively ruining people’s lives and such hate campaigns should not be funded by a well-respected British company such as yours.  It is clear to me that the vitriol and hostility displayed in The Daily Mail is immediately at odds with your company values  particularly those promoted in your advertising campaigns which celebrate ideas of peace  togetherness and the acceptance of difference. The Daily Mail seeks to deliberately create divisions between various groups of people in our society which is of great concern considering the recent rise in hate crimes in the United Kingdom. Wouldn’t you agree that being associated with this newspaper could harm the image of your brand and that advertising in their publications could be counter-productive in the long-term?  I understand that retailers sometimes do not feel the need to question their advertisers’ political view but I feel that the blatant hostility shown towards refugees and Asylum Seekers by The Mail’s editorial goes beyond politics. I am fully aware that all publications are within their rights to express political and ideological bias but I feel in the case of the newspaper in question  they have gone too far and are consistently breaking codes of conduct without facing the consequences. As an advertiser for the newspaper  Sainsbury’s has the influence to encourage our press to change for the better and help restore a sense common decency which sadly seems to have evaporated in recent years as far as the tabloid press are concerned.  I sincerely hope that Sainsbury’s will review how and where it advertises. Until then  I will not be spending money in any of your stores and will continue to make public my views on the subject.  Many thanks    Anwen Ebenezer";2016-11-13T22:07:05+0000;10155436474809377_10155436536309377;d46cb5796929d0a00b01ea34371278b714692a43;0;🙄;2016-11-13T22:26:15+0000;0

What could I do to right this terrible wrong my incompetence had bestowed upon my family?   *Light bulb moment*   I had a £10 off voucher when I did my shopping online (on the condition that I used it before 19/11/16 and spent over £50). Now  I have checked the date several times in the last few hours and according to my... Er  the wife s  Justin Bieber calendar - it is still 13/11/16  so the overseers of time are on my side.  YES!  I shrieked. The wife briefly looked away from MasterChef long enough to give me a deathly stare  as she sat hungry in a grocery-less house.  The only caveat remaining would be that I need to spend over £50  and let me tell you  I shall do that with gusto and ease. If only there were a scenario requiring me to spend under £50 - now that would be a challenge  with my young son clicking  add to trolley  for the 17th time on a pack of drawstring bin liners.

I was greeted with the terrible news that my voucher had expired. How could this be? I had met all the required criteria. How would I break the news to the family that our shopping had all of a sudden become more expensive?  Crestfallen and defeated  I turned the laptop off.

When I picked the box up to put on the checkout it started to bend and collapse. I managed to get it into my car in one piece securely lodged in the boot  sadly the box was such poor quality by the time I got home it had virtually collapsed completely  the strawberry tarts were unrecognisable and the strawberry syrup was all over my shopping and bag.  Took an age to clean everything up.Sainsbury need to rethink the quality of their cake boxes  before I will buy anymore.;2016-11-13T12:16:47+0000;10155434899654377_10155435030359377;pageowner;0;What a shame.

I felt the need to write a review after a recent trip to my local Sainsbury s Saltisford in Warwick on Wednesday 09th Nov @ approx 7.30pm.  I was in a rush as always but needed to stop by to check my lottery ticket and buy some stamps before heading out to see an old friend that night.   I approached the kiosk and was greeted by a big smile from your lovely colleague Sue? (Smaller lady with short blonde hair) Now this is my local JS but I haven t seen this lady working on the kiosk before.  Anyway what was intended to be a quick pit stop turned out to be one of the most heartfelt occasions..  I ve never made it public to family and friends before.. but I suffer with anxiety and I am certainly not the most confident person on the planet.. but I had made a special effort that night as I was going out for drinks with an old friend which doesn t happen often enough. Sue looked at me smiling  eyes lit up and said  well don t you look lovely  I laughed it off as I m not used to somebody being so attentive. She went on to say  you look gorgeous  I love your eye make up with that touch of glitter .. I immediately smiled back and said  thank you  that s the kindest thing a strangers said to me in a while  she waved me off and told me to have a great evening and make the most of it.  I did just that! I walked out that store with my head held higher than it has been in a long time. Suddenly I felt great again.. confident..  so I just wanted to say to Sue  thank you! It s the little things in life that matter and all it took was a 2minute conversation and she had made my week. She didn t have to say anything.. but I m glad she did.  I m a firm believer that what goes around comes around and if anything she deserves employee of the month!   Thank you for being you Sue.

I was in a rush as always but needed to stop by to check my lottery ticket and buy some stamps before heading out to see an old friend that night.   I approached the kiosk and was greeted by a big smile from your lovely colleague Sue? (Smaller lady with short blonde hair) Now this is my local JS but I haven t seen this lady working on the kiosk before.  Anyway what was intended to be a quick pit stop turned out to be one of the most heartfelt occasions..  I ve never made it public to family and friends before.. but I suffer with anxiety and I am certainly not the most confident person on the planet.. but I had made a special effort that night as I was going out for drinks with an old friend which doesn t happen often enough. Sue looked at me smiling  eyes lit up and said  well don t you look lovely  I laughed it off as I m not used to somebody being so attentive. She went on to say  you look gorgeous  I love your eye make up with that touch of glitter .. I immediately smiled back and said  thank you  that s the kindest thing a strangers said to me in a while  she waved me off and told me to have a great evening and make the most of it.  I did just that! I walked out that store with my head held higher than it has been in a long time. Suddenly I felt great again.. confident..  so I just wanted to say to Sue  thank you! It s the little things in life that matter and all it took was a 2minute conversation and she had made my week. She didn t have to say anything.. but I m glad she did.  I m a firm believer that what goes around comes around and if anything she deserves employee of the month!   Thank you for being you Sue. I loved Sainsbury s before but now I have even more reason to smile when I shop there.   ☺️;2016-11-13T11:53:29+0000;10155434857099377_10155444627784377;cdce62979cfb61c6aefbaf5592c6457a601306d8;0;Well done sue you are always a happy and cheerful college xx;2016-11-15T16:06:01+0000;3

I felt the need to write a review after a recent trip to my local Sainsbury s Saltisford in Warwick on Wednesday 09th Nov @ approx 7.30pm.  I was in a rush as always but needed to stop by to check my lottery ticket and buy some stamps before heading out to see an old friend that night.   I approached the kiosk and was greeted by a big smile from your lovely colleague Sue? (Smaller lady with short blonde hair) Now this is my local JS but I haven t seen this lady working on the kiosk before.  Anyway what was intended to be a quick pit stop turned out to be one of the most heartfelt occasions..  I ve never made it public to family and friends before.. but I suffer with anxiety and I am certainly not the most confident person on the planet.. but I had made a special effort that night as I was going out for drinks with an old friend which doesn t happen often enough. Sue looked at me smiling  eyes lit up and said  well don t you look lovely  I laughed it off as I m not used to somebody being so attentive. She went on to say  you look gorgeous  I love your eye make up with that touch of glitter .. I immediately smiled back and said  thank you  that s the kindest thing a strangers said to me in a while  she waved me off and told me to have a great evening and make the most of it.  I did just that! I walked out that store with my head held higher than it has been in a long time. Suddenly I felt great again.. confident..  so I just wanted to say to Sue  thank you! It s the little things in life that matter and all it took was a 2minute conversation and she had made my week. She didn t have to say anything.. but I m glad she did.  I m a firm believer that what goes around comes around and if anything she deserves employee of the month!   Thank you for being you Sue.

I did just that! I walked out that store with my head held higher than it has been in a long time. Suddenly I felt great again.. confident..  so I just wanted to say to Sue  thank you! It s the little things in life that matter and all it took was a 2minute conversation and she had made my week. She didn t have to say anything.. but I m glad she did.

I ve never made it public to family and friends before.. but I suffer with anxiety and I am certainly not the most confident person on the planet.. but I had made a special effort that night as I was going out for drinks with an old friend which doesn t happen often enough. Sue looked at me smiling  eyes lit up and said  well don t you look lovely  I laughed it off as I m not used to somebody being so attentive. She went on to say  you look gorgeous  I love your eye make up with that touch of glitter .. I immediately smiled back and said  thank you  that s the kindest thing a strangers said to me in a while  she waved me off and told me to have a great evening and make the most of it.  I did just that! I walked out that store with my head held higher than it has been in a long time. Suddenly I felt great again.. confident..  so I just wanted to say to Sue  thank you! It s the little things in life that matter and all it took was a 2minute conversation and she had made my week. She didn t have to say anything.. but I m glad she did.  I m a firm believer that what goes around comes around and if anything she deserves employee of the month!   Thank you for being you Sue.

I felt the need to write a review after a recent trip to my local Sainsbury s Saltisford in Warwick on Wednesday 09th Nov @ approx 7.30pm.  I was in a rush as always but needed to stop by to check my lottery ticket and buy some stamps before heading out to see an old friend that night.   I approached the kiosk and was greeted by a big smile from your lovely colleague Sue? (Smaller lady with short blonde hair) Now this is my local JS but I haven t seen this lady working on the kiosk before.  Anyway what was intended to be a quick pit stop turned out to be one of the most heartfelt occasions..  I ve never made it public to family and friends before.. but I suffer with anxiety and I am certainly not the most confident person on the planet.. but I had made a special effort that night as I was going out for drinks with an old friend which doesn t happen often enough. Sue looked at me smiling  eyes lit up and said  well don t you look lovely  I laughed it off as I m not used to somebody being so attentive. She went on to say  you look gorgeous  I love your eye make up with that touch of glitter .. I immediately smiled back and said  thank you  that s the kindest thing a strangers said to me in a while  she waved me off and told me to have a great evening and make the most of it.  I did just that! I walked out that store with my head held higher than it has been in a long time. Suddenly I felt great again.. confident..  so I just wanted to say to Sue  thank you! It s the little things in life that matter and all it took was a 2minute conversation and she had made my week. She didn t have to say anything.. but I m glad she did.  I m a firm believer that what goes around comes around and if anything she deserves employee of the month!   Thank you for being you Sue.

I immediately smiled back and said  thank you  that s the kindest thing a strangers said to me in a while  she waved me off and told me to have a great evening and make the most of it.  I did just that! I walked out that store with my head held higher than it has been in a long time. Suddenly I felt great again.. confident..  so I just wanted to say to Sue  thank you! It s the little things in life that matter and all it took was a 2minute conversation and she had made my week. She didn t have to say anything.. but I m glad she did.  I m a firm believer that what goes around comes around and if anything she deserves employee of the month!   Thank you for being you Sue.

I felt the need to write a review after a recent trip to my local Sainsbury s Saltisford in Warwick on Wednesday 09th Nov @ approx 7.30pm.  I was in a rush as always but needed to stop by to check my lottery ticket and buy some stamps before heading out to see an old friend that night.   I approached the kiosk and was greeted by a big smile from your lovely colleague Sue? (Smaller lady with short blonde hair) Now this is my local JS but I haven t seen this lady working on the kiosk before.  Anyway what was intended to be a quick pit stop turned out to be one of the most heartfelt occasions..  I ve never made it public to family and friends before.. but I suffer with anxiety and I am certainly not the most confident person on the planet.. but I had made a special effort that night as I was going out for drinks with an old friend which doesn t happen often enough. Sue looked at me smiling  eyes lit up and said  well don t you look lovely  I laughed it off as I m not used to somebody being so attentive. She went on to say  you look gorgeous  I love your eye make up with that touch of glitter .. I immediately smiled back and said  thank you  that s the kindest thing a strangers said to me in a while  she waved me off and told me to have a great evening and make the most of it.  I did just that! I walked out that store with my head held higher than it has been in a long time. Suddenly I felt great again.. confident..  so I just wanted to say to Sue  thank you! It s the little things in life that matter and all it took was a 2minute conversation and she had made my week. She didn t have to say anything.. but I m glad she did.  I m a firm believer that what goes around comes around and if anything she deserves employee of the month!   Thank you for being you Sue.

Sue looked at me smiling  eyes lit up and said  well don t you look lovely  I laughed it off as I m not used to somebody being so attentive. She went on to say  you look gorgeous  I love your eye make up with that touch of glitter .. I immediately smiled back and said  thank you  that s the kindest thing a strangers said to me in a while  she waved me off and told me to have a great evening and make the most of it.  I did just that! I walked out that store with my head held higher than it has been in a long time. Suddenly I felt great again.. confident..  so I just wanted to say to Sue  thank you! It s the little things in life that matter and all it took was a 2minute conversation and she had made my week. She didn t have to say anything.. but I m glad she did.  I m a firm believer that what goes around comes around and if anything she deserves employee of the month!   Thank you for being you Sue.

Just over a week ago we paid the Upton store a visit while in England in the hope to deliver a  thank you  card to Ryan Pierce  Mike Paterson and Geraldine for their willingness to help my unwell father in-law that was in hospital recently. Not only did they deliver on that help at the time  but they went more than the extra mile....Furthermore  just when I thought that they couldn t do anymore for us  we were bowled over by the welcome we got when visiting. Ryan  Geraldine and Customer Service Manager  Brenda offered us coffee and cake  gave us two beautiful bouquets of flowers and vowed to help our unwell and ageing family with a tailored service going into the future. Ryan Pierce subsequently told us that he couldn t accept a cash gift that we wanted to give so instead bought 50 selection boxes out of it for the children who are in Arrowe Park hospital!!! It is very clear to us that Sainsbury s Upton contradicts the stereotype of large companies taking from communities  and instead shows us that community spirit and customer loyalty is at the core of their business. It is also clear that these types of people are the unsung heroes in our neighbourhoods  and this whole story is a true example of pulling together to do a good deed - even if it is outside the normal remit.

It is very clear to us that Sainsbury s Upton contradicts the stereotype of large companies taking from communities  and instead shows us that community spirit and customer loyalty is at the core of their business. It is also clear that these types of people are the unsung heroes in our neighbourhoods  and this whole story is a true example of pulling together to do a good deed - even if it is outside the normal remit.  Well done AGAIN Sainsbury s!!;2016-11-12T20:16:49+0000;10155432475449377_10155440940164377;6adb7bf6e3529da8d4b03aeb8bb47ad1b787e45e;0;I worked here when it first opened and it was a great place back then.

Regardless of some of the (worryingly) unsupportive comments above, you're right to ask a supermarket to look at it's policy with regards to advertising. If they don't advertise in papers that incite racial hatred then that's a plus. And you're right to want to challenge the right wing press over some of the general oppressive crap that's published day in, day out. Maybe if more of us were brave enough to do something about it then we could make a difference- no harm in trying 👍👍;2016-11-13T21:18:52+0000;0

I've spoken with the store, who have apologised for the mistake but have advised me that the sandwiches were offered to be made whilst your father waited. I know this is not the convenience that you had wished, so I would like to offer a £5 goodwill gesture, for you to spend on your son in store. Could you PM us your Nectar card details? We'll get that arranged for you. Ash.;2016-11-13T15:32:31+0000;0

Why don't the articles use evidence to back up their arguments? For instance, what has an ""openly gay"" judge got to do with anything? And the way they describe the legal challengers to Article 50, was that necessary? Why can't we engage in open debate and discussion without dragging in irrelevant facts about a person's appearance, gender or sexual orientation? I would be more likely to take on board the opinions of others if we did. http://m.huffpost.com/uk/entry/uk_581c986be4b0c2e24aaf739f;2016-11-12T21:38:03+0000;0

Last night I went to do my online order only to find that now they have removed the Sainsburys Tomato  red pepper and lentil chilled soup as well. This means there are now only 2 vegan soups in their chilled range. During the last month or so  the Sainsburys Tarka Dhal tinned soup (which was gorgeous) has been removed  as has the Swedish Glace strawberry soy icecreams (5 indivual icecreams on sticks) and the Almond Dream Salted Caramel  icecream  . At least I can get the last two from Waitrose for the moment. Also the Basic Baby Lotion has been removed and I cannot find any moisturing lotion suitable for women that has the Leaping Bunny cruelty free symbol on it. One is restriced enough when trying to buy cruelty free products but it is upsetting when the few you like and rely on disappear without warning. If you have to reduce the number of products on the shelves  try removing some of the non-vegan or vegetarian products. There are masses of them to choose from and they cannot all be wonderful sellers. If the vegan products are not moving very well  you could try a  cruelty free promotion  and put them all together in store for a short time.

Quite an experience/ They close at 23.00 so they were preparing for closing and putting out large delivery cages As I was stood at the chilled section one of your employees just pushed the cages along and wandered of  not controlling them.

I was shopping with 2 children  one asleep in a pushchair and another insisting on being in a trolley. Cue a stressed mummy pushing 2 hefty unwieldy things. Firstly a security guard looked after my shopping so I could take the my daughter to the loo. Then the store manager and colleagues saw me struggling and arranged for someone to push my trolley for me  and in the meantime the manager and what appeared to be a top dog manager  helped me around the store  pushing my daughter and guiding me to the produce I needed. Once I had finished paying  one of the trolley guys saw me and helped me to the car. THANK YOU SO MUCH for helping a stressed mummy and making her smile.

However the person making the claim has to have the receipt that shows the cash back transaction. In this case my wife returned in minutes. The store could reasonably ask for proof of identity of the claimant who would then be open to charges of theft/fraud. Given that the vast majority of people are honest Sanisbury's should give the customer the benefit of the doubt. We live within walking distance of this store and have done since it opened over 20 years ago.

Our tills in-store won't be cashed off until Monday, so this is why you have been advised of the wait, however I've been advised that as part of the process all CCTV records are checked as well as the till records. A member of our cash office will be in touch with you on Monday. Ryan.;2016-11-11T18:33:44+0000;1

I don't think they run that system any more as the last time I got cash back at the same store neither I nor the check out clerk signed the receipt. You do have to 'accept' the cash back part of the transaction before you put you pin in. However this leaves the customer vulnerable as the clerk could forget to give the money, as in this case, but guilt/error is presumed on the part of the customer. Hardly the right attitude for a customer focused, and dependent, organisation.;2016-11-11T19:09:59+0000;0

But the fact is your process presumes error/guilt on the part of the customer.  It would also be interesting to know what (if any) pressure the check out clerk is under to not admit they made a mistake? Would they be sanctioned? Would there be a risk of dismissal if the person was new and on probation? If, and I am speculating here, there were sufficient pressure not to admit an error the clerk may well pocket the money just to get the till to balance while having no intent to pocket the money in the first place.;2016-11-11T19:48:26+0000;0

This year is no exception, there are tables inside the store to make a large display of Poppies, and other items,  each day we have different sellers ranging from service  cadets last weekend to wonderful veterans, who  assure me that Sainsburys are proud to look after them during their shift selling poppies. We have displays of poppies hanging from the ceiling of the store, and all staff have a poppy badge sticker to attach to their name badge . Sainsburys Brentwood really could not do more to promote the sale of poppies and to look after all those involved with selling them.  Clearly the manager at Plymouth needs a firm word from someone senior,  but please do not judge all  branches by this one, I would be ashamed too, if I shopped there.

He was a tall lad with brown hair that was spikey. To be honest the customer service across the majority of this store has gone massively down hill in the past few years, it seems that virtually no one has the time to stop and help, they just make you feel like you are an inconvenience for disturbing whatever they are doing. I hope my description is full enough to identify this young lad so that he can be taught some basic manners and customer service. I have my receipt if this can be of any further help to you. Also, if the store is aware of the issue with the lighting in the car park, why has it not been sorted yet, it has been like it for months.;2016-11-11T12:19:52+0000;0

I find  all your delivery drivers polite   helpful and friendly.  I don t often have items substituted   however   when I do   is when my problems start.  Perhaps you could give extra  common sense   training to the people you employ to pick out the shopping   as some of them clearly need it.  If I select three bags of 500g grated mature cheddar on my shopping list   does it not stand to reason that I need around 1500g of grated cheddar in total?  Yes?  No.  Apparently not.  Thank you   so much   for the three bags of 250g grated cheddar you instead sent me.  It s so very useful to me to receive half of what I required.  This may not seem like a big deal   and I agree   it s very minimal in the grand scheme of things. However  I use your service for its convenience and so that I don t have to trek out into a crowded supermarket with a potential timebomb of a 2 year old in tow. This  convenience   is now rendered moot: I have to trek out (in the snow)  to buy the rest of the cheese I need.  Nor is this the first time   if it were  I probably wouldn t be typing this right now.  In the past I have requested nappies in a certain size  only to be sent them in a completely different (and totally useless) size.  Honestly   do the people who do this job think parents want nappies that do not fit their child?  Either supply the correct size in a different brand   or don t bother at all.  Various other stupid substitutes you have sent me (and often charged me more than the original item for)  help to build the aggravation I feel right now.  I hope you take note of my points.  I expect you will not. However  next time you are looking for staff  I have a 12 year old son who displays more intelligence selecting alternative items than some of your existing trained monkeys.;2016-11-09T10:23:34+0000;10155419844679377_10155420615819377;pageowner;0;Hi Claire, sorry about that.

I hopped on down to your store in Trowbridge to buy a few bits  including my husband and I s beloved make your own pizza. They are no doubt the best value pizza s out there  total class. Our usual order? 14  thin  BBQ sauce  chicken and double peppers - simple yet effective  I think you ll agree. Oh and always wrapped so we can have it super hot and melty straight away at home. Perfection. When I got to the counter there was a young lady and a very tall gentleman who I assume was a manager of sorts due to how he was speaking to the young lady. He wrote down my order  said it would be 5 minutes  so off I went and picked up my other bits. I returned around 5 minutes later to find the tall man speaking in an ad-hoc meeting with the young lady and two other counter staff. My pizza had not been made. No bother  I know it doesn t take long to do. The young lady then proceeded to make it with me waiting. It was handed to me upside down as it was right off the vacuum thingy. I have just properly looked at it  having taken the wrapper off. Definitely not double peppers  and to my utter horror it has been made with a tomato base  not BBQ. I have this evening been severely deprived. Tomato base is just not for me; I live for a BBQ base. Now whose fault was it? The young lady being mildly berated by a manager in front of the public reading his instructions wrong  and being taken away for a mini-meet when a customer order was waiting  perhaps not checking what I had asked for?

Now about the pizza, I know tomato base isn't the best but a healthy serving of BBQ sause from a squeezy bottle would have mustered the taste. #ResolvingFirstWorldProblems The staff speaking to each other is totally unnecessary, they should work in silence and never speak to anyone.

I have just came to a very unpleasant letter issues by a debt recovery company informing me I have to pay £130 by 17/11/2016 or they will take me to court. As you can imagine this has caused me a considerable amount of stress and worry.   I have used your store in Penrith and it s car park a number of times. However this has left a very sour taste in my mouth and has left me very reluctant to stop in your stores again.   I was only in your store earlier today and noticed that those cameras which are meant to log cars coming in and leaving your car park are actually not working!! How can you enforce a parking fine if £130 for a car park which hasn t been functioning properly for at least the last 2 months?   £130 is a very steep fine to expect your customers to pay and I think it is an unnecessary stress that you are allowing people to face. I am a single full time working mum who has to work 2 jobs to make ends meet I don t have £130 spare sitting around just to pay out like that.   So as one of your customers I am asking you to act up on this and sort your car park systems out and the company s that run them. As previously mentions the cameras in your Penrith branch car park have no been working for some time so how can you enforce it for one car and not another?   I would very much appreciate it if you spoke to your car parking company and got this car park fine cancelled as it has been unfairly given due to having no other letters regards this other that this 1 I have reviewed to day.

I ordered my online grocery shop on Saturday 5th November to arrived between 9-10am on Monday night. I went through the 3D security and received the standard confirmation email and text regarding my order. However 10.20pm on Monday night I had still not received my shopping. I rang the customer service team and spoke to someone that was most unhelpful and said that the driver had already been past my home and they had rung. However I had not received any phone call or voicemail and they have delivered to my address previously. The customer service team member said my transaction had not gone through yet they had packed everything in the store to deliver to mine? As soon as there was any issue regarding my order I should have been contacted immediately. However if I had not have rung up late last night I doubt the store would have contacted me. The customer service member then said that it was too late for any more deliveries to come back out despite the fact they deliver in my area between 10pm-11pm so someone could have come back out with my shopping. I was informed and assured the manager of the local Taplow store would contact me first thing in the morning regarding this. However this never happened. This is very heartless from such a big chain superstore that a manager can not respond to my complaint. I now have no idea where my shopping is or how I will be getting my money back. One thing for sure is I will not be recommending anyone in future to use Sainbury s online delivery service as there customer service on this particular occasion was completely non existent.;2016-11-08T09:43:33+0000;10155415791404377_10155416781649377;pageowner;0;Sorry about that Chris!

I bought a microwave about 1 year ago and the microwave started to smoke and catch fire whilst cooking something in it so I contacted my local sainsburys who asked me if I had the receipt to which I answeres I lost the receipt  I called customer careline to tell them and they told me to send my microwave oven to them so that they could run a quality test on the microwave. I received a letter saying that they would be in touch within 15 days. I heard nothing for about 4 weeks and then I called them and asked what had happened to my microwave. They told me they were waiting for an answer from their quality control. Well a couple of days past and they called me up and told me that some dried food was inside the microwave oven and this is why it caught light  they then told me that they could not give me another microwave. I asked them if I could have my microwave back because if it was only food that had caught light then of course it would still work and I would be able to get my microwave back  well they told me they would call me back that day to see if they could get me my microwave back  it has now been 1 week and still no telephone call or my microwave back.. Do not buy any sainsburys microwave oven grill because they are rubbish and only last 1 year avoid at all costs!!!

They told me they were waiting for an answer from their quality control. Well a couple of days past and they called me up and told me that some dried food was inside the microwave oven and this is why it caught light  they then told me that they could not give me another microwave. I asked them if I could have my microwave back because if it was only food that had caught light then of course it would still work and I would be able to get my microwave back  well they told me they would call me back that day to see if they could get me my microwave back  it has now been 1 week and still no telephone call or my microwave back.. Do not buy any sainsburys microwave oven grill because they are rubbish and only last 1 year avoid at all costs!!! Sainsburys also do not work with a resolution dispute service like the retail ombudsman service so you can t make a complaint to anyone but sainsburys!! So there is no point buying their products.. Thanks Sainsburys you let me down;2016-11-07T22:21:49+0000;10155414228854377_10155417825679377;4f303286e8a47f2d284699f69403d23edf06d1ec;1;Sainsburys,  unfortunately we seem to go round in the same circles and I am not very happy...

Seems like a bit of an obvious use case to me (I work in QA) as well as poor customer experience with the charges. Interested in any comments and I can get a refund due to this flaw?;2016-11-07T12:39:04+0000;10155412633479377_10155413536714377;pageowner;0;Oh dear, sorry about that Lewis.

I get those are the rules... Like I said previously. What I'm not happy about is that it excludes FIRST STAGE baby milk and the fact that if I had been advised this I would have happily spent MORE money to be able to use my voucher... Also, are the vouchers that print off from the till generic or does it go by what you buy? Like I said, why bother insulting me with a voucher off pampers size 3&4 when your system knows full well I buy size 5? And the fact I purchased two chocolate bars I didn't want! It's not about the money, I've never complained to a store in my life before. It just infuriated me that I was made to run around looking for chocolate bars for nothing, holding up a queue of 5 tutting and impatient customers for nothing! Christchurch, Dorset. Sorry, but I don't feel like you've taken my comments on board. Sainsbury's;2016-11-07T17:50:03+0000;0

But after visiting the restaurant with my two young daughters i was flabbergasted at the sheer lack of organisation and customer service!!! We arrived about 11.45 and with a less than half full restaurant we Queued for over 10 minutes to be served. My children had chosen a sandwich meal deal which you choose the pre made sandwich at the refrigerator. As 1 of my children will only eat a sandwich without butter I decided to pick a pre made sandwich for my youngest child then with intention to ask the staff if they could make a sandwich fresh with no butter. They lady behind the counter was less than helpful and refused point blank to make a sandwich saying   this is something we do not do!!  Feeling annoyed I decided that I would order some hot food instead  but was told that we would have an half an hour wait for hot food. Confused at this point that a restaurant which was not even half full and just before lunchtime was already delayed with hot food by half an hour shows a complete lack of organisation. My biggest complaint is that a restaurant was unable to make a ham sandwich with no butter (2 slices of bread and a piece of ham) is absolutely disgraceful!! We did buy the 1 sandwich meal with the pre made sandwich and neither of my children ate the sandwich as the lumps of butter stuck to the bread made the sandwich inedible. I feel any organisation which provides a food service  particularly children s meals should always have an healthy option and a company of Sainsburys stature should be showing their customers they are fully onboard with the issues regarding obesity concerns with the younger generation.

My first port of call was a pair of gloves for my two oldest children. On my way to the clothing I passed a mum with her little boy; he wasn t very happy about something but I didn t bat an eyelid  I m a mum  I know what it s like. A short amount of time passes and I m in the food aisles now  I heard a child crying and shouting  people are literally stopping to stare  and it s this little lad with his mum. I don t know how old he was but I wouldn t say he was older than about 6/7  his mum had to get on the floor to comfort him  and I wanted to go over to her and tell her what an amazing job she was doing considering 1) her little boy was having a massive moment and 2) half the bloody store just stop and stare  some tutting like they ve never seen a child make any noise before. I m still pacing the aisles looking for tinned peaches  which I eventually find and pass the mum again and I just give her a friendly smile  I have been there so many times with my 5 year old who can t deal with super markets  she s got sensory issues with noises  having to sit still  having to be quiet and I ve had the meltdown in the supermarket and the whole world staring many  many times... I eventually get to the checkout and I m bagging up my items when I hear the little boy crying  he s at the checkouts now  a few rows down from me. The girl who is serving me is scanning my items when her colleague behind  who s also scanning someone s shopping  turns around and says very loudly   someone needs to sedate their child.  In absolute shock that she had even said that  I could help but react.  It s not so easy when you ve got kids.

So to everyone in the big Sainsbury's this afternoon whilst my youngest was having the meltdown of all meltdowns.....  There are a number of reasons why I as his mum acted like I did :  1) being angry dealing with anger DOES NOT nor will it EVER have a successful outcome for either party  2) hugging and calming (calming and soothing) your child is the best and most effective method of reducing the huge levels of cortisol that are flooding their brains during a meltdown  (if they will let you) ⭐️just to add here - if a brain floods with cortisol it can 'shut down' the rational, thinking, problem solving part of the brain and so this is NOT a good time to try and reason with them.... physiologically their brain is being high jacked and survival is the focus....they ARE NOT NOT CHOOSING the right choice.... ⭐️ 3) instilling in your child that they can ask for a hug can be a way of asking for your help because they know they have gone past what they can manage alone 4) I do not condone my son shouting, screaming or hurting me but I am working hard to show him that patience, love, reassurance and sometimes planned ignoring are better and do not leave us both more damaged emotionally or physically 5) modelling has to be just that..... I need to model behaviours that I wish to see in him, even when he appears to have 'lost the plot'. I need to be that role model   And that after giving him the space and love and time for cortisol levels to reduce significantly, we have had a truly beautiful conversation about both our feelings, we both recognise how painful that was for both of us, but that we love each other so wholly unconditionally that nothing will ever come in the way of that. Our behaviour can always be improved but our behaviour is not something that is who we are. We have discussed strategies for dealing with anger but most importantly we have restored peace between us and in his words  ""my heart has screwed itself back together so I can love fully again"".   So to all my mum friends out there, know we ALL have these really challenging and testing times, BUT all we can do is the best we can do!  Love to you all but mostly to my two beautiful children who teach, forgive and love me daily. I love you ALWAYS and am hugely proud to be your mum!!! ❤️️❤️️❤️️❤️️❤️️  NB Thank you to the one lady who smiled at me whilst I was sat on the floor hugging my son in the middle of an aisle;2016-11-06T21:29:20+0000;75

As a mum of two (one of which struggles with his emotions) I have had many many a moment very similar to this with customers stood gawping at me and some even passing me by making rude comments about the way I am dealing with my child. This I understand Sainsbury's can not control but to the lovely colleague who once said to me 'my gosh you have a loud child I hear him other end of the store' then walking off was not really helpful. Wish at the time I had complained but unfortunately I was going through a very hard time in my life and my self confidence was at an all time low. Joanna Liversidge you know you are a superstar!! Becky Airey really wish a customer like you has passed by me that day.... a simple smile like that would have made the situation that little bit better..... maybe I wouldn't have then picked my screaming child up and walked out without my shopping as I just needed to leave the place and maybe I would have spent the time in store dealing with my child in the manner I know works for him without feeling the pressure of trying to quieten him down asap.

I m still pacing the aisles looking for tinned peaches  which I eventually find and pass the mum again and I just give her a friendly smile  I have been there so many times with my 5 year old who can t deal with super markets  she s got sensory issues with noises  having to sit still  having to be quiet and I ve had the meltdown in the supermarket and the whole world staring many  many times... I eventually get to the checkout and I m bagging up my items when I hear the little boy crying  he s at the checkouts now  a few rows down from me. The girl who is serving me is scanning my items when her colleague behind  who s also scanning someone s shopping  turns around and says very loudly   someone needs to sedate their child.  In absolute shock that she had even said that  I could help but react.  It s not so easy when you ve got kids.  I blurted in her direction  the girls serving me looks a little worried as I think she can also sense that it wasn t the best thing to say.. Maybe it bothered me more because the child was doing exactly what my eldest was doing  and I felt sympathy for her  not annoyance at the child. Even if you thought that the child was  in need of sedating   you wouldn t say it in front of customers. I m pretty sure she didn t have any children  I mean  if she did  she wouldn t have ever come out with a comment like that. I could have been anyone  I could have had my eldest with me  who would have also not been very happy to be there  I could be a mum with a severely autistic child who s struggling with being where they are. It s completely not professional at all and its stayed with me all evening. I wanted to go and give the mum a high five before I left and tell her how well she was still doing  she had patience like no other even by the time she got to the checkout. I know how hard it is to get round the place and keep everything together! I don t know what the girl was called on the checkout  but she was very young  blonde hair  lots of make up with dreadful eyebrows. I m not sure I want to come in the store with my children anymore  so you might have just lost yourself some custom. Today they happened to be waiting in the car with Daddy.

I think it was very unnecessary, and it annoys me even more when comments come from people with no children... 😒 Because they have absolutely no idea.   I've been contacted anonymously, and now I know the name of the girl on the checkout (confirmed with a photo) so I can make a formal complaint. I spend a lot of money in there, and a comment like that yesterday has made me rethink where I'll be going in future.;2016-11-07T08:00:42+0000;4

Big sigh of relief when it's done and praise baby for getting through what can only be similar to emotional jenga!

Even when there isn't an upcoming event, there's still so much filling their little brains, and it's doing exactly what supermarkets want it to do -  except as an adult we can think rationally about what we buy, and accept it when we can't have something but it's not so easy for children.   Can't believe how many people have reacted and shared my post, thank you so much, it's served its purpose in one way already as I'm glad Joanna got to read it.

I don t know how old he was but I wouldn t say he was older than about 6/7  his mum had to get on the floor to comfort him  and I wanted to go over to her and tell her what an amazing job she was doing considering 1) her little boy was having a massive moment and 2) half the bloody store just stop and stare  some tutting like they ve never seen a child make any noise before. I m still pacing the aisles looking for tinned peaches  which I eventually find and pass the mum again and I just give her a friendly smile  I have been there so many times with my 5 year old who can t deal with super markets  she s got sensory issues with noises  having to sit still  having to be quiet and I ve had the meltdown in the supermarket and the whole world staring many  many times...

In absolute shock that she had even said that  I could help but react.  It s not so easy when you ve got kids.  I blurted in her direction  the girls serving me looks a little worried as I think she can also sense that it wasn t the best thing to say.. Maybe it bothered me more because the child was doing exactly what my eldest was doing  and I felt sympathy for her  not annoyance at the child.

I m pretty sure she didn t have any children  I mean  if she did  she wouldn t have ever come out with a comment like that.

If you carried on to the end of this post you'd see that this was not a spiteful person who'd raised this to sainsburys, but more of a mother and a obviously well educated individual, who knows what's right and what's wrong,or do you agree with the sedating comment made?? I think becky put it rather brilliant actually and in a very effective way stating all the facts..   And as a mother to young children I think alot of us all here say well done to Becky Airey and the fact that this was bang out of order...

On my way to the clothing I passed a mum with her little boy; he wasn t very happy about something but I didn t bat an eyelid  I m a mum  I know what it s like. A short amount of time passes and I m in the food aisles now  I heard a child crying and shouting  people are literally stopping to stare  and it s this little lad with his mum. I don t know how old he was but I wouldn t say he was older than about 6/7  his mum had to get on the floor to comfort him  and I wanted to go over to her and tell her what an amazing job she was doing considering 1) her little boy was having a massive moment and 2) half the bloody store just stop and stare  some tutting like they ve never seen a child make any noise before. I m still pacing the aisles looking for tinned peaches  which I eventually find and pass the mum again and I just give her a friendly smile  I have been there so many times with my 5 year old who can t deal with super markets  she s got sensory issues with noises  having to sit still  having to be quiet and I ve had the meltdown in the supermarket and the whole world staring many  many times... I eventually get to the checkout and I m bagging up my items when I hear the little boy crying  he s at the checkouts now  a few rows down from me. The girl who is serving me is scanning my items when her colleague behind  who s also scanning someone s shopping  turns around and says very loudly   someone needs to sedate their child.  In absolute shock that she had even said that  I could help but react.  It s not so easy when you ve got kids.  I blurted in her direction  the girls serving me looks a little worried as I think she can also sense that it wasn t the best thing to say.. Maybe it bothered me more because the child was doing exactly what my eldest was doing  and I felt sympathy for her  not annoyance at the child. Even if you thought that the child was  in need of sedating   you wouldn t say it in front of customers. I m pretty sure she didn t have any children  I mean  if she did  she wouldn t have ever come out with a comment like that. I could have been anyone  I could have had my eldest with me  who would have also not been very happy to be there  I could be a mum with a severely autistic child who s struggling with being where they are. It s completely not professional at all and its stayed with me all evening. I wanted to go and give the mum a high five before I left and tell her how well she was still doing  she had patience like no other even by the time she got to the checkout. I know how hard it is to get round the place and keep everything together! I don t know what the girl was called on the checkout  but she was very young  blonde hair  lots of make up with dreadful eyebrows. I m not sure I want to come in the store with my children anymore  so you might have just lost yourself some custom. Today they happened to be waiting in the car with Daddy.

I have often been that mum in the supermarket so I know how it feels when your little ones are not happy and you are very aware of the all the eyes that are on you and all the disapproving looks! It is always nice to see that one smiley face that says I understand what it's like and it reminds you that you are not on your own and that all children go through this. I'm not sure I would've have liked to have heard that comment coming from a member of staff. They have no idea of circumstances and sound like they have no clue on what it can be like having children. Very unprofessional of her.;2016-11-08T07:14:13+0000;1

A short amount of time passes and I m in the food aisles now  I heard a child crying and shouting  people are literally stopping to stare  and it s this little lad with his mum. I don t know how old he was but I wouldn t say he was older than about 6/7  his mum had to get on the floor to comfort him  and I wanted to go over to her and tell her what an amazing job she was doing considering 1) her little boy was having a massive moment and 2) half the bloody store just stop and stare  some tutting like they ve never seen a child make any noise before. I m still pacing the aisles looking for tinned peaches  which I eventually find and pass the mum again and I just give her a friendly smile  I have been there so many times with my 5 year old who can t deal with super markets  she s got sensory issues with noises  having to sit still  having to be quiet and I ve had the meltdown in the supermarket and the whole world staring many  many times...

The girl who is serving me is scanning my items when her colleague behind  who s also scanning someone s shopping  turns around and says very loudly   someone needs to sedate their child.  In absolute shock that she had even said that  I could help but react.  It s not so easy when you ve got kids.  I blurted in her direction  the girls serving me looks a little worried as I think she can also sense that it wasn t the best thing to say.. Maybe it bothered me more because the child was doing exactly what my eldest was doing  and I felt sympathy for her  not annoyance at the child. Even if you thought that the child was  in need of sedating   you wouldn t say it in front of customers. I m pretty sure she didn t have any children  I mean  if she did  she wouldn t have ever come out with a comment like that. I could have been anyone  I could have had my eldest with me  who would have also not been very happy to be there  I could be a mum with a severely autistic child who s struggling with being where they are.

I blurted in her direction  the girls serving me looks a little worried as I think she can also sense that it wasn t the best thing to say.. Maybe it bothered me more because the child was doing exactly what my eldest was doing  and I felt sympathy for her  not annoyance at the child.

Maybe it bothered me more because the child was doing exactly what my eldest was doing  and I felt sympathy for her  not annoyance at the child. Even if you thought that the child was  in need of sedating   you wouldn t say it in front of customers. I m pretty sure she didn t have any children  I mean  if she did  she wouldn t have ever come out with a comment like that. I could have been anyone  I could have had my eldest with me  who would have also not been very happy to be there  I could be a mum with a severely autistic child who s struggling with being where they are. It s completely not professional at all and its stayed with me all evening. I wanted to go and give the mum a high five before I left and tell her how well she was still doing  she had patience like no other even by the time she got to the checkout. I know how hard it is to get round the place and keep everything together! I don t know what the girl was called on the checkout  but she was very young  blonde hair  lots of make up with dreadful eyebrows. I m not sure I want to come in the store with my children anymore  so you might have just lost yourself some custom. Today they happened to be waiting in the car with Daddy. Please educate your staff on professionalism and manners!  Share this post  I hope the mum in question sees this  take my hat off to her.";2016-11-06T20:11:31+0000;10155410401599377_10155416414494377;65de40db0bbad00f809994a2988da0072da2e608;0;Ok, so the eyebrows. As a professional in that field, I'm qualified enough to make that assessment based on what I physically saw. And it was a way to differentiate her against the other girls around on the checkouts. Did I mean it in a hurtful way, no, it's just how I would describe them. I would say that to her face, and I've made comment on many an issues in my time as a very successful beauty therapist/skin consultant/make up artist and teaching of beauty therapy sciences.   Her comment however, was based on nothing more than what she could hear, and quite frankly should have been kept to herself. She's not a mum so has no idea what it's like to have children to deal with. Maybe if she was a parent, she wouldve said something different. She also has no idea what that little boy might be dealing with! She couldn't see him from where she was. Nor did she know the situation(s) leading up to his meltdown. Or if he deals with issues on a daily basis.

Given that there are thousands of us, that's a lot of us to annoy.  In the desert choices there are two of the same flavour in a pack.  I really fancied a spotted dick and a treacle sponge, not two of each.  So on that occasion I was that annoyed that I took one out and replaced it with the other.   Next month perhaps I should start splitting 6 packs of single flavoured yoghurts.  Perhaps put these on You Tube heading 'choices for single people👍🏻' What do you think?;2016-11-07T19:33:24+0000;0

And this is the second time by your staff as well! I was using the restaurant in your Westwood cross store in Thanet Kent. Me and a friend ordered meals and where told it would take 15m due to it being busy which was not a problem  after a while a nice lady brought us the completely wrong meals so they went back  we weighted for a long time then she came back with two meals which we didn t order again  so we weighted again we where talking and didn t notice how long this was all taking we then where completely forgotten about after a hours weight we had enough and decided to go and get our money back  which was fair enough the lady handing out the meals was very apologetic  she went to get the manager who was the opposite  she said to me I had ordered some that wasn t on the menu till lunch and said that was my fault I pointed out that my friend had order a breakfast and we where brought the wrong meals twice also if it wasn t being severed why had you taken my money if I was told I would have ordered something else  no apology she had a really bad attitude!!

And this is the second time by your staff as well! I was using the restaurant in your Westwood cross store in Thanet Kent. Me and a friend ordered meals and where told it would take 15m due to it being busy which was not a problem  after a while a nice lady brought us the completely wrong meals so they went back  we weighted for a long time then she came back with two meals which we didn t order again  so we weighted again we where talking and didn t notice how long this was all taking we then where completely forgotten about after a hours weight we had enough and decided to go and get our money back  which was fair enough the lady handing out the meals was very apologetic  she went to get the manager who was the opposite  she said to me I had ordered some that wasn t on the menu till lunch and said that was my fault I pointed out that my friend had order a breakfast and we where brought the wrong meals twice also if it wasn t being severed why had you taken my money if I was told I would have ordered something else  no apology she had a really bad attitude!! She took my receipt which is for £6.75 and gave me £5 back? I asked about the rest and she had taken off for the coffee!

The original post is not about enforcing parent/child spaces but enforcing no parking in white hatched areas and double yellow lines outside the store which is dangerous for your customers. I've never had an issue getting a space because I can be arsed to go and look and even subject myself to a little walk, something which these people who are abusing these areas appear too lazy to do. I am requesting that at this store you look to do something because according to John Lewis you own the land. It's clear though from all the Sainsburys responses that you're not willing to even look at a possible solution so that's fine, I'll bob an email to Mike Coupe to see whether he's more willing to help.;2016-11-07T09:43:23+0000;0

Unfortunately I disagree with you Ash. This is an ongoing problem and having already contacted John Lewis to ask them whether there was anything they could do, they stated Sainsburys own the car park therefore I think you do have authority. Moreover I believe that both you and John Lewis have a social and a moral responsibility to ensure the safety of your customers.

It's actually quite dangerous when people park in these areas because you can't see properly to cross the road - especially with small children. Essentially you're saying you take no responsibility and don't care what problems a minority of your customers cause for the rest of us. Tesco have started giving out parking tickets locally to people not abiding by the rules (such as parking in parent and child spaces when they don't have children with them). Perhaps you should look to their example.;2016-11-06T16:54:03+0000;0

In fact it always gives me a smile when I see in the local store I visit that they have to discount due to date most of the sandwiches. I know exactly why you did what you did. To get more money.

You probably make more money from scrapping the total meal deal offer. It s never about the consumer. It s about your bottom line.

You have completely missed the point I was making. The Legion's stand should not have had to give way. This is a large superstore. I remained bemused that there was no alternative. The justification for the fireworks point being near the front of the store was health and safety and the ban on customers carrying fireworks around the store. Perhaps next year the firework collection point should be in the car park in a pop up mobile cabin i.e. Order in store at customer services and then retrieve outside thus freeing space up. I do sincerely hope that from Monday the Legion are relocated in-store. Yours a very disappointed customer;2016-11-06T14:41:05+0000;6

Les went to Sainsburys for a cooked chicken. 10 already cooked but because their water was off they were not allowed to serve the chicken as the staff wouldn t b able to wash their hands! The staff use a fork to put the chicken in the bag. When he asked what would happen to the 10 chickens he was told they would be thrown away! What!!! Have Sainsburys got bottled water. kettles to boil water to wash hands and gloves to stop hands touching the food. He offered to buy them all for £10 but they said they couldn t.

It doesn't  say anything about cow's milk, it didn't say that the second most common ingredient is sugar and it didn't say that it contains wheat flour.

My son is incredibly sensitive to dairy and he's been ill ever since I started buying this product and I didn't know why.

Telling customers to ask a member of staff for allergens implies cross contamination only and not misleading labelling.  If you know that there's a lot of milk  and wheat why not say that there is gluten and dairy, preferably in bold. This is standard in all products. Why not say as well that there's a LOT of sugar when in the package you only mention honey.

So basically what this means is you can write whatever  list of ingredients you'd like on the package and then just tell the customer to take an unnecessary step (just to create confusion) to find out the real list of ingredients. So, you can pretend the product doesn't have sugar (when it's the 2nd most common ingredient), pretend that it has honey (when it doesn't) and pretend that it doesnt have allergens.

I ve been wearing the above jeans all day and I was delighted with my bargain after taking advantage of your recent 25% off offer  however things turned for the worse this evening....   Following a long conversation on my mobile with a friend  I ventured from my sofa to get myself a glass of wine from my kitchen  it was at this point I noticed my hands had turned blue! Luckily a friend was with me  and he looked concerned as he felt them and also said they were cold! Nervously I sat down and started to think something was not quite right. I shook them and rubbed them together but nothing changed the colour.... I did at the same time have a rather nasty pain in my back (which I have had for a couple of days) and I began to think this was linked!! I duly called NHS 111 for their advise. I spoke to an assistant who asked me a 1000 questions about my well being and she assured me I would now be referred to a clinical consultant  who would call back immediately. Anxiously I waited and within minutes I was now speaking with a very helpful medical professional. Again more questions were asked and I was advised to keep my hands above my head and if the colour didn t change it would be best to see my doctor in the morning!!.   My hands were not changing colour... I was worried  I hadn t eaten all day  and I d been in the same position all day doing my tax return  so my friend suggested I go to the fish and chip shop with him  maybe moving would make a difference to the clear lack of circulation... I duly followed his suggestion.  I returned home  could barely touch my fish and chips as I had lost my appetite as my fear grew as the colour hadn t changed at all.   I then called my best friends mum who was an ex nurse maybe she could re assure me! In the meantime my friend went to his van and retrieved a rather old but still functioning blood pressure reading machine. My friends mum asked a number of questions and got me to take my pulse. She then told me a similar incident happened to her daughter (my best friend) where they ended up at A and E  omg I was really getting scared now  and still my hands had not turned back to a normal colour!!!!!!   After assessing my condition once again  My friends mum did add that when she was in A and E they found out that in fact her blue hand condition was in fact the dye from her jeans.......  Yep  you guessed it!!!! I went to the bathroom washed my hands and low and behold the the lather from the soap started turning blue!!!!   Omg  I was so relieved that it was the dye from my new Sainsbury s jeggings and my life wasn t coming to an abrupt end....  I had suffered temporarily from  jegginginitious    Ha ha what a funny evening I ve had  but may I point out to you  that perhaps your dark blue skinny jeans and jeggings need to come with a health warning!!!!  Kind regards  Karren Kent;2016-11-04T22:10:02+0000;10155403522849377_10155405441389377;pageowner;0;Hey Karren. This post did make me laugh, I'm glad you're not injured.

No more faith in them. False information, extra charges without explanation, agreements not kept, failure to respond when previously arranged, case left to sit for over a week by personal account manager despite promise to sort before this date, and ran over next payment date causing further issues financially.

I am still to receive a call back from you  that you promised me. I went back to the store on 23 October and requested to speak to store manager  Lindsay Cole. Once again  she wasn t available  I was told by Duty Manager - Gary. He s promised to get the store manager to call me  investigate the original complaint and why customer services didn t call em back. As you can guess  no one has called me back. On top of that  while I was in store speaking to Gary  two members of staff stood behind him and listen to the whole conversation. After I ve walked away  my partner was still stood there and heard the lady called Cay say about me :  people would just do anything to get something for free  !!! I ve just called your customer service people again and it was most frustrating and infuriating experience of my life. No one could tell me why I haven t received a call back or offer any other resolution apart from contacting the store manager and asking them again to call me back. I am not prepared to wait another month to hear a reason why no one called me back in first place. I am not interested in the reason why  it is simply unacceptable  there is no valid reason for this to ever happen. I asked to be put through to a manager  a person called James who introduced himself as an Online  Manager had told me that he needs to find out why the store didn t get in touch with me and there is nothing else he can do for me. When I told him this isn t good enough and I am not prepared to deal directly with the store after I ve been treated by staff in such awful manner. James became really nervous on the phone  admitted that he doesn t usually speak to customers on the phone and when I suggested he should put me through to someone who knows how to deal with customers over the phone - he hung up! I am livid and just beyond disappointed with the level of customer service you provide. You ve wasted a lot of my time  cause me stress and upset. I would like to know: is this Sainsbury s stand on how to treat customers? Do you not tell your employees not to make derogatory comments about customers in store  especially while those customers are still ins tore shopping? Is it normal to hung up on customers who is upset because they ve been waiting for a call back for over a month and been insulted in the store? I m appalled. Speechless. I ve spent thousands of pounds in your store this year alone. I am not planning to set my foot in any of your stores ever again.;2016-11-03T11:37:43+0000;10155398156624377_10155398251864377;pageowner;0;Hi Magda, sorry about this.

I saw a campaign from you yesterday around the Fenchurch area (not sure if it was the Fenchurch St branch) whereby your team was handing out free sandwiches  as well as a voucher for the On the Go range. This was a lovely treat and I m sure everyone enjoyed their free lunch. It did strike me  however  that these free lunches were given to people generally who could buy their own  with no real explanation of the campaign  rather than the number of homeless people in the area who I m sure would have appreciated it a whole lot more. I chose to give my sandwich away to someone who really needed it  and I wondered if you would consider this in the future.

Each of our stores have their own arrangements for supporting local charities, food banks and the like, which is all arranged at store level. While I understand where you're coming from, this will have been to promote the new On the Go range and help encourage new lunch time shoppers who would normally go elsewhere. If you're interested in discussing something like this, pop in and speak to your nearest superstore's PR Ambassador - they'd love to chat to you about this. Ryan.;2016-11-03T12:06:34+0000;0

Well sainsburys think it s completely acceptable that you do.  Yet again after giving them the benefit of the doubt  they send me fresh produce in a 3pm delivery slot to be used by that day.  Their stance is its to reduce their food waste but it would seem they have no problem increasing ours  the consumer.  So basically we save them money as they offload their soon to be (questionable that it s not already) out of date stuff and basically we re out of pocket as we have to bin it.  Hmm that seems fair...  If you re a binge eater great then this is the shop for you. If like I  you do a weekly shop to last you the week then I suggest you save your money and get to a shop yourself.;2016-11-03T09:14:31+0000;10155397824499377_10155398089879377;pageowner;0;Hi, so we can look into this, could you Message us an order number, the account holder's name, email address and postcode?

I got to the till and the Cashier  Pam ...saw me and instantly offered assistance to unload the trolley...being a bit stubborn and proud I declined...the lady customer in front of me then offered to help and started unloading my trolley....Pam then summoned a colleague over and insisted I let her help...along with Daisy this kind lady unloaded my whole trolley...chatting to Daisy throughout. Pam then packed all my shopping into bags and loaded them back into my trolley. Those three ladies might just see what they did as part of their job or duty but it really did mean so much to me...and totally made my day.Thank you Pam/her colleague and lady customer of sainsbury s Lordshill!!!!!

If the risk is even small, it could be a minefield for Sainsbo's.

Just need to realise the ridiculous amount of food we waste in this country, the UK is the biggest waster of food in Western Europe. In the UK last year over 1 million people turned to food banks yet we waste millions of tonne of food. It's like bread, think of the time and effort to grow flour, the energy it costs to cook it, the packaging and if it doesn't get sold it goes to waste. We rescue easily close to half a tonne of food destined for landfill every week from a small selection of retailers and it's shocking to see what gets wasted. We're only a small section in Northampton, nationally it must be scandalous!;2016-11-02T21:34:29+0000;0

Carving pumpkins are edible, but it's not recommended to eat them. We operate a zero waste to landfill policy and while we've reduced the price of the pumpkins, any we have left over will be put to good use. As with all our items, if we can't sell them we'll either donate them to local foodbanks (where suitable), turn them into animal feed to support British farmers or send them for anaerobic digestion to turn into green energy that powers one of our stores. Each store makes arrangements with local charities at store level, so I'd recommend getting in touch with them for more info!

( the issue retails to a purchase of fuel we made during the Sainsbury s/Nectar Swipe to Win weekend...we purchased a qualifying sum of fuel but due to an error made by the cashier when paying my Nectar card didn t scan correctly so I didn t receive my bonus points coupon. ) I was then sent into the customer services desk in store where I was advised that my claim would need to be dealt with manually and in due course I would be contacted with regards to the addition of the specific bonus points I d won for that specific transaction.

When I asked why he had not ordered more he said he could not do that with seasonal lines they were handled by head office. Surely the supply management of a seasonal product  with a short window of opportunity  which is also regionally popular should be ordered by a system that capitalises on sales and satisfies customers. #bonefirenightnoparkinatsainsbury;2016-11-02T09:27:13+0000;10155393747189377_10155394013089377;pageowner;0;Sorry about that Julie, DM us your email address.

I'm sorry that when you bought the aforementioned items from our Hinckley store they had exceeded both their display by and best before dates.This incident certainly isn't up to our usual high standards and we have strict stock rotation and checking procedures in place that should prevent it from happening. I've been in touch with my colleagues in our Hinckley store and they will investigate this issue and ensure that staff are more vigilant in the future. As a result of this happening I'd like to apply £10.00 worth of Nectar points to your card ending 5018. Please allow between 3 - 5 working days for them to be applied. I've also logged your comments so that my colleagues both in store and in our trading teams are aware of them. They regularly review our customers' comments to make sure they're meeting our high quality standards, and I'm confident that they'll monitor this issue closely moving forward. We appreciate you contacting us about this and hope to see you shop with us again soon. Kind regards Ian Morgan | Sainsbury's Careline Hope this helps, Megan.;2016-11-03T15:57:57+0000;0

And possibly due to the fact I said I would remain at the kiosk until someone found my item even if I had to grab a blanket and cushions from the shelves and spend the evening in the TV department watching repeated adverts. The young lady I saw told me that they hadn't been trained in how to deal with click and collect for eBay at all. One lady knew how to deal with a DPD collection so that dealt with the elderly gent behind me in the queue. Mystical Sam who never appeared had apparently gone and taken the instruction sheet with her according to the harassed young girl dealing with me. Eventually a more mature lady materialised and took control of things somewhat - informing me that she was Sam's best mate! Hallelujah! Sam does exist after all! This lady valiantly tried to defend Mystical Sam and informed me that Sam had told her on the telephone that she had shown everyone how to deal with eBay collections etc. I wasn't buying it! Doesn't seem she did it very well judging by the fact the young lady ""Lauren"" I think her name was bless her, and several other colleagues stood looking traumatised and mystified and Lauren looked about to burst into tears or spontaneously combust. In fact,  she looked more annoyed than I did. Which I felt rather indignant about to be fair ... I was the one being inconvenienced after all.  However. After half an hour of faffing about my parcel appeared only for another performance  of no one knowing which code to enter into the dreaded handheld device in order that they mark it delivered.  Pretty appalling stuff really after a long day at work where I'd opted for what I assumed would be the quicker and more convenient option from such a large and reputable company.;2016-11-02T09:09:29+0000;0

The varieties grown for carvers and monsters are designed to grow large and be robust so that they can be carved. They are not the best tasting varieties. If customers would like to eat pumpkin we recommend our Edible pumpkin product. These are specially selected varieties which have higher levels of sugar and taste great.

Sainsbury's are advocating you DONT eat the carving pumpkins ( when you clearly can, albeit they wont have quite the flavour of those grown for eating)instead they want you to buy their more expensive eating versions ( which retailer wouldn't?)  FWIW carving pumpkins with the addition of a little cumin, coriander, cream and time, make a lovely soup....and to be equally fair to Sainsbury's, the eating versions are a lot more versatile and have more standalone flavour.;2016-11-02T14:56:47+0000;0

What was the problem is we ordered 2 breakfasts at a cost of £4.55 each. When both breakfasts arrived we got a plate each with a mushroom, bacon and scrambled egg on it. When I asked where the beans and hash browns were she brought them out on separate plates with 1 sausage each. When we asked where the other sausage was she apologised and came out with ANOTHER plate with 2 sausages on it. The toast we got was seeded bread, not the toast we wanted and both came with mushrooms that wasn't even on the board. We were made to look like pigs with 3 plates each.
