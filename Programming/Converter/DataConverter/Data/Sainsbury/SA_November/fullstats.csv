What I would like to add is we were grateful to Callum who was the person serving us. we were in the store for an hour and forty five minutes trying to locate stock there or another if they didn t have it. I have to say Callum did everything possible  nothing was too much trouble for him to deal with our faulty tv. He was polite and was trying his best to resolve the issue there and then aswell as doing other jobs on the customer service desk. He made what could have been a stressful situation into one that really wasn t. I really hope he gets recognised for his great customer service we can t fault him.

Saw the 48  Celcus 4K Smart TV advertised on the shelf for £270. Just the kind of thing we d been looking for  and my 4 and 6 year olds were thrilled. I went to the counter to check they were in stock  only to be told quite coldly by the lad at the counter that  they re not at that price anymore  they re back up to £370 - that label shouldn t be on the shelf.  He then went on to say that  the offer ends on 30th November .  It IS the 30th November! I only realised this after leaving the store with two devastated toddlers. I was in the store at just after 8pm? It is still the 30th  so how can this possibly be the case? I couldn t afford the TV at £370  and so have left feeling extremely upset by the whole experience. Is there any way that Sainsburys can honour the actual quoted price for me please; particularly as the information I was given seems to be inaccurate?";;;;;2016-11-30T21:58:22+0000;1480543102;2016-11-30 22:58:22;1;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

You may have seen my post before it got taken off.  Their reply is below.  It appears you pay 40p even if you only get 1 bag   When agreeing to the carrier bag charge it is 40p for however many bags your shop needs. You don’t actually pay for a set amount of bags  do not choose how many you get and the amount you get is determined by your orders need for bags.    We now offer the option for you to choose whether you would like to have your order delivered with or without carrier bags. If you select not to receive bags you will not be charged the 40p carrier bag charge. You can select this option on the checkout page.  Our aim has always been to reduce the number of carrier bags used by our customers  reflecting the environmental objectives set out in the new legislation. We believe that our 5p reusable bags are the most effective way to do this  as they are made of recycled material and are recyclable plus we will replace them free of charge if they become damaged.  We also donate any profits we make from these reusable bags to good causes.  We do however  still provide single use carrier bags for online orders should a customer request their shopping be bagged. We will no longer have single use bags in our English stores as reusable bags are more environmentally friendly and we also believe that our customers will want something sturdier which they can reuse again and again.  We are therefore charging 5p for a reusable bag  in addition to our 10p bag for life. We will continue to use single use carrier bags for our online deliveries and will charge a flat fee of 40p per delivery. ;;;;;2016-11-30T12:32:36+0000;1480509156;2016-11-30 13:32:36;0;4;0;0;4;4;3;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ordered a Lego Star Wars advent calendar for click and collect today- my day off  ready to arrive with my sons elf on the shelf in the morning. He is 6 years old and questioning whether Santa is real already 😢 so I am going all out this Christmas to make him believe again. He knew the elf was bringing him the advent calendar. Unfortunately I received a call ten minutes ago saying you d swapped the Lego advent calendar for a Lindt chocolate one. It hardly compares  does it. Had I known in advance I could have ordered one online as stores are completely sold out. So thanks for that Sainsbury s. Maybe you could let customers know in advance if you don t have an item  or even better  don t give people the option to buy and pay for a product you can t provide. 😡;;;;;2016-11-30T09:18:45+0000;1480497525;2016-11-30 10:18:45;2;1;2;1;4;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Can you bring back the previous recipe and call the new one the reduced salt/sugar version.

I was disappointed to see how gender stereotyped these dolls were and the choice so limited. We opted for a doll dressed fully in pink with a pink headband as the other choice was a baby dressed in pink or another one dressed in pink. I looked hopefully through the selection of clothes you could buy separately to dress the dolls  again  a pink sleep suit and a purple dress were my options.   Please understand that it is shops that drive the gender stereotyping of childrens toys  not those buying it.   In the real world there are baby boys as well as baby girls. Lots of babies are dressed in neutral coloured clothes or a whole rainbow of other colours (not just blue or pink). Dads look after babies as much as mums so this is not just a girl thing.  I am trying to bring up my children to understand that gender is not relevant in what they choose to do  but so many things surrounding them point otherwise. Perhaps you could consider my comments when looking for new stock.  Kind Regards  Hannah Ringrow;;;;;2016-11-28T17:24:04+0000;1480353844;2016-11-28 18:24:04;10;9;14;2;25;9;5;4;13;0;10;3;0;1;0;0;0

SO have 3 complaints  1) you have erected a barrier in the carpark at your Low Hall site which stops us going into part of the carpark in our camper van - which is our regular vehicle. Please can you have this removed.  2) I went shopping at Low Hall yesterday and your security people were removing a Big Issue seller. I asked them what they were doing and why. They said it was Head Office Policy. I said that wasnt a reason! Very strange to see your xmas tree and all the good-willy messages and to see a homeless person treated like that. I bought a Big Issue from him but he was seen off  3) I wish you would get rid of the voucher system - wastes so much time at the checkout ... and also paper!;;;;;2016-11-28T14:32:59+0000;1480343579;2016-11-28 15:32:59;2;2;2;0;4;2;1;1;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

These are much fiddlier than the previous  push it in the slot  mechanisms  and as a person with arthritic hands  very difficult to operate.

I m not sure who you asked but everyone I know would prefer to shop by item of clothing.  I don t go into a shop thinking I need girls  clothes.  I think she needs some trousers.  It s infuriating having to go to 2 sections to find trousers.  In fact  I have already begun to shop elsewhere as my daughter is very aware of what is being marketed for boys or girls and I do not wish her to be adversely affected by your sizing (eg. boys trousers falling down on her and girls cutting into her waist) or styles (eg. superhero costumes only in the boys section and princess costumes in the girls) or the appropriateness for play (lovely cosy fleecy generously sized hoody for boys  small  fitted  thin hoody for girls - as if they don t go to play outside.)  I used to buy all clothes for my children in your shops  but the segregation  labelling according to gender and differences in sizing are enough to make me take my custom elsewhere until these issues are rectified.;;;;;2016-11-27T19:23:10+0000;1480274590;2016-11-27 20:23:10;2;0;5;0;5;0;0;0;0;0;2;2;1;0;0;0;0

My 14 year old daughter was with me in Chester today when we walked past your express store in Watergate Street she noticed that there was cash sticking out of the cash point which had been left behind. We removed it and there was £ 50 there and then asked around to see if anyone had seen who used the cash point but no one knew who it was. Holly (my daughter) then had no hesitation in going into your store and handing it in to your staff. I am very proud of her as I am sure you can imagine £ 50 would have made her shopping trip in Chester far more enjoyable. Your staff thanked her for being so honest and said that there was a camera at the cash point and if someone did try and claim it then they could check it was theirs. I was hoping you could find out for us from the store if anyone came back to claim it or not. Holly was worried about how the person would feel when they noticed they had lost it. We look forward to hearing from you hopefully. Kind Regards Clair Eccleston  proud Mum of Holly Eccleston;;;;;2016-11-27T18:40:18+0000;1480272018;2016-11-27 19:40:18;26;9;26;1;36;9;9;0;25;0;26;0;0;0;0;0;0

I get completely sick of your labelling of girls and boys clothing - she will be the judge of what she likes!  We have gruffalo pj s from the boys range  it also appears sooty was only available in boys too (one of her favourites). Looking for coats last week I found the girls coats to be very bling and sone in unpractical colours. The boys however we so much better designed with cuffs  hoods  long in the body and with zips and pockets. Needless to say we chose one of those instead!  Now I am amazed to see the Hey Duggee pj set is in the boys section too. What are you thinking?!  They are colourful and completely and utterly gender neutral  all children love hey duggee and that is the point - so why in your opinion do you think girls wouldn t like these?;;;;;2016-11-27T17:59:44+0000;1480269584;2016-11-27 18:59:44;6;10;6;0;16;9;5;4;13;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;0

My children are two and four and have a range of interests from playing make believe with toys to outdoor sports and games.  I want them to be warm in the winter and cool in the summer with practical clothes that withstand the general wear and tear of climbing  running  swinging  playing in sand and everything else small children love to do.  They need to be washed after almost every wear due to splashed mud and paint  spilt food and unfortunately the occasional toileting accident.  My children like many colours and enjoy watching a wide variety of TV programmes and films from Pixar to CBeebies.  I am a grown woman in my 30s and I know my children and am able to differentiate between colours and characters that they like without somebody in a marketing department somewhere making arbitrary choices for me.  As a result  I am continually frustrated by the unhelpful way clothes are organised in my local Sainsbury s.  Children s clothes are separated into 3 different age categories as well as gender divides so if I m looking for warm practical trousers that can be worn in the winter months playing outside for both my children  there are 4 different sections I need to look through for me to find something suitable.  If all the trousers were in one place  it would actually make shopping a lot easier.  The gender divide in particular results in awful slogans perpetuating negative stereotypes such as girls are only valued on their appearance and boys are inherently naughty.  Some characters are only available on one gender or age range even though they might have universal appeal.  As an example  clothes with Paw Patrol on them only feature boy characters on the boys clothes and girl characters on the girls clothes.  I have read on another page that you have stated customer preference for arranging clothes as you do but I can honestly say this is not my preference.  Please can you look into organising all children s clothes according to type.  Both my children wear a range of clothes bought from the boys and the girls sections in a variety of shops as well as hand-me-downs from other boys and girls.  Children s body shapes are not that different until they reach puberty and in the interest of bringing up well rounded individuals  I try my hardest not to limit their interests with outdated attitudes.  I have worked in marketing myself and understand the various audience segmentation tools that companies use and how a microscopic focus on ROI leads many companies to treat them as gospel.  In my opinion  however  lazy use of gendered colours  images and slogans just leads to the perpetuation of potentially damaging stereotypes and in this day and age  particularly when it comes to children  I think any company that makes an example of themselves by taking a stand would actually reap far more benefit from a greater proportion of the population.  Kind regards   Lucy Forrest;;;;;2016-11-27T16:20:36+0000;1480263636;2016-11-27 17:20:36;4;2;6;0;8;2;1;1;0;0;4;1;1;0;0;0;0

However  on opening   the cheese was more like a mild rubbery cheddar  yellow and hard rather than crumbly. Used it anyway   but  it did not behave in the usual way  on cooking  much rubberier than normal.  Have their been production problems   or could it have been cheddar  wrongly  packaged?

This evening my son and I shopped for household products and food at our local store. On our departure I remembered that we needed logs for our fire.  Our home relies on our log burner a great deal due to the age of the house and other factors.  Tonight my teenage son and I planned a film night.  Pretty unheard of these days as film nights with mum aren t so cool or whatever the word is for that these days. We picked up two bags of logs from your petroleum station on the way out of the store.  Paid £6/bag for what I d normally pay half at other high street named store.  But I figured the time saving was worth it  because it meant longer with my son.  So  fast forward to having a lovely evening of film watching and being snug. I asked my lad to open the bag of logs.   They re a bit damp  he says. We tried for over 3 hours to light the driest logs.  No joy...do no toasty room.  Could have saved myself 2 3/4 hours and £6 overall on my original £12 purchase.  I m not sure that I can find my receipt but I m so beyond disappointed I felt I needed to contact you.  Surely   if you re going to sell these products  you should store them so they should be fit for purpose?  Especially when they are double the cost of many other retailers. These bags of wood are beyond damp (and you cannot tell this when you buy them because of how they are bagged and stored. They just feel as cold as the air around them).  Anyway  we used a blanket to add heat but I am beyond frustrated with you Sainsbury s.;;;;;2016-11-26T20:27:28+0000;1480192048;2016-11-26 21:27:28;2;20;4;0;24;20;3;17;7;0;2;0;1;0;0;1;0

So this afternoon gave in... tree went up... opened the lights and tested them... working ... GREAT STUFF! So we put the lights on the tree... decorate it which takes us a few hours... turn the lights on and WOW  the tree looked beautiful. 2 happy girls! Hours pass by  were watching T.V whilst we can see the twinkle of lights in the corner of our eyes and all of a sudden there off and it s dark. As you can imagine 2 very unhappy girls. So I check them but lights are simply not working anymore. Tomorrow morning we are going to have to take all the decorations off and then all the lights.... take a 20 minute drive to our nearest store to hopefully exchange (if this the right thing to do as will this happen again???) or get my money back and on the hunt for some more blue LED lights again... gutted and angry is and understatement. 🙁;;;;;2016-11-26T20:01:43+0000;1480190503;2016-11-26 21:01:43;2;12;6;0;18;12;3;9;1;0;2;0;0;0;4;0;0

I took my 85 year old grandfather and my 6 month old daughter in her buggy. I decided we would stop for coffee and cake before shopping  however when we got to the lift to go up to the cafe it was out of order. I then had to walk my grandfather and get the buggy over to customer services to see if there was another way up since the lift wasn t in service  I was advised that the lift had been broken for 2 weeks and they didn t know when it was to be fixed and there was no other way up to the cafe other than the stairs. This was obviously going to prove difficult due to the buggy and my grandfather. In the end I had to ask customer services had to find a member of staff to help me carry my daughter in her buggy up the stairs  wait with her at the top whilst I helped my grandfather up the stairs. Then we had to wait for a member of staff to do the same when we wanted to go down. Luckily there were no accidents when carrying the buggy up and down with my daughter in it!  I understand things break and need fixing but firstly 2 weeks is a long time to have the only lift broken  and secondly we are lucky that my grandfather could use the stairs (albeit took a while for him and knackered him out!). If he was in a wheel chair or not as able  the stairs wouldn t have been an option! By law do you not have to have a lift as essentially you are saying no one in a wheelchair can use your cafe until the lift is fixed?!   Of course we could have not gone to the cafe but my grandfather is diabetic and he needed to eat something to keep his bloods stable.  Not impressed sainsburys with no lift  having to leave my daughter with a stranger  and the general attitude of your customer service staff who really couldn t care less!;;;;;2016-11-26T10:48:31+0000;1480157311;2016-11-26 11:48:31;0;3;2;0;5;3;2;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;2;0

Your driver failed to give us 17 of our items  none of which have shown up as being unavailable on our receipt  and I have been charged for. The driver then sent my husband inside the van to look for the remainder of our order. Oh and did I mention that when he called  30minutes late he voiced his disappointment that we live on the third floor and asked for help... my husband obliged on the bases he was running late  and yet what a disaster this all turned out to be. We did not sign for our shop because he couldn t work his hand held computer  accused my husband of loosing the receipt  even though the delivery man later found it in his van  and refused to give us any contact information regarding our concerns that a substantial amount of our shopping was missing even though we had been billed for it. Disgusted and disappointed.  Rude and unprofessional.;;;;;2016-11-26T00:28:47+0000;1480120127;2016-11-26 01:28:47;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

On the latest  I was required to spend £60 to get £9 off  which as 15% seemed a good deal. I noted the exclusion of spirits and liqueurs from the offer  and decided to increase my stock of wine at your Waterlooville store. When I got to the checkout  the operator told me that the coupon was not accepted by her machine. I pointed out the lack of excluded items  and she told me that I needed to check the small print on the back of the coupon. I told her I had. She called for a Supervisor  from the group of 4 who were too busy to notice customer needs  so I went to the group and got one to come over. She asked if I had any spirits or liqueurs  and then went away to find another Supervisor. When that Supervisor arrived  she overrode whatever obstacle there was  and the coupon was finally accepted. These coupons are a nice gesture  but if they cause this much hassle to your staff and me  not to mention the customers queueing behind me  then someone needs to take a long hard look at the system.;;;;;2016-11-25T17:12:21+0000;1480093941;2016-11-25 18:12:21;1;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Myself and two colleagues work shifts covering a 24 hour period for the NHS and on the afternoon of Monday 21st of November we were talking about Black Friday  we all thought it would be a good laugh and a chance to get some bargains to head over to Lincoln s Tritton Road store for approximately 11:45pm ready for the Black Friday deals to be revealed at midnight. In preparation for this little outing we checked your website to see if there was any spoilers as to what was going to be in the deals  to our delight there was a few items - great! Upon searching in a very popular search engine  Sainsbury s Black Friday  your Black Friday page was top of the search engine with a link to your site  once on the site you had a countdown box which was counting down to midnight of Friday 25th November with a message underneath saying  Black Friday deals in store only!  Brilliant  we re all set! Plans were made with meeting places and the designated driver was assigned. Plans were going smoothly despite myself and a colleague finishing late from our shift  spirits were high and it was nice to do something socially. The 20 mile trip was made to our most local 24 hour Sainsbury s talking about what we were looking to buy  especially for our children for Christmas and we arrived at 11:45pm to find the car park very empty. However we just thought people weren t as mad as us! When we arrived at the store there was a number of staff smoking outside the main entrance where the general public were still walking past which I found very disrespectful  personally. As we approached the main entrance one of your staff members said to us   you do know we are shutting at midnight until 6 don t you to get ready for the deals?  We we re all laughing and expecting her to say  just joking!  But she didn t  of course it wasn t her fault she was just a member of staff. However  what disappointed us the most was how misleading your website was  with the countdown ending at midnight we fully expected to be allowed around the store which was 24 hours with no signs saying they would be closing early. Due to the nature of our job we then missed the actual sale at 6am this morning.   And I forgot to get some bread.   A response would be gratefully received.;;;;;2016-11-25T09:13:16+0000;1480065196;2016-11-25 10:13:16;0;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0

I was in your Edinburgh south bridge branch this evening and there was just two poor girls working to get through a long queue of people resulting in no one to help me because the machine wasn t weighing my item. The nice bouncer did try to help  but as he is not technically a cashier he couldn t do much. I ended up leaving all my groceries on the check out and going to tesco instead. I will be boycotting sainsburys from now on if you think it is acceptable to give staff less hours and therefore less customer attention. Appalling behaviour especially when a lot of our staff will be already be struggling to pay bills before you doing this. Not that anyone at your HO would understand what it s like to struggle to pay bills. Anyone who reads this  boycott sainsburys and shop somewhere where they care about staff and customer welfare!;;;;;2016-11-25T00:08:50+0000;1480032530;2016-11-25 01:08:50;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am not ashamed to say that it slipped my mind. Being in a hurry to pick my children up  I couldn t return for an item and promised myself that I would pick up something next time. However  the reality of it is... that next time I will probably do exactly the same thing! It got me thinking......... what if you had a designated shelf or two especially for foodbank items near each check out? You could have one member of staff who is in charge of contacting the foodbank to see what items are specifically needed (as I am sure this differs in each locality) and place these items near each till with a noticable  food bank  sign. I (and many others) would be sure to notice and pick up an item before we paid. The foodbank in each area would also recieve items that they need. Just an idea!

However  on this occasion it is regarding a more serious matter. This evening  myself and my sister were putting air in my car tyres at the Sainsbury s petrol station attached to the superstore in Uxbridge on Coldharbour Lane. However next to us  we spotted a cyclist going passed  although unfortunately for him  a drain cover had broken meaning the drain was uncovered and his wheel got caught and subsequently he flew over the handle bars! We rushed over towards him  and whilst my sister pulled the bike off of him I rang for an ambulance. He was able to sit himself up  however he had gone face first  broke his helmet and smashed his glasses  so as you can imagine there was a lot of blood! I stayed with him whilst my sister went into the store to get more help  but she was met by a member of staff who simply handed her the emergency first aid bag and then wandered off. My sister then had to administer minimal treatment herself until the emergency response arrived! Once the emergency response came we moved inside and were given paperwork to fill out. For the rest of the duration from which the accident took place and the patient being taken to hospital in the ambulance  there was very minimal and poor communication from the 3 members of staff who we met. And we did all the paperwork! We asked the patient the questions  we got his details  we stayed with him until he was taken to the hospital  and we took his bike back to his address where his mum was very appreciative for all we did for him. And that s ok for us  we are both disabled and we appreciate what it means to have someone stop  stay  talk with and help in any way possible when an accident happens. But your staff were useless  showed no empathy and didn t care - that s just wrong. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in Sainsbury s  for not taking care in their outside environment which tonight therefore resulted in an accident. I am also disappointed about their entire attitude towards the patient  ourselves and the emergency response staff on scene. We were in disbelief!!  I want to see that the drains are fixed so that this accident does not happen to someone else  and I want to make sure ALL staff who work for Sainsbury s are first aid trained. In the event of a life/death emergency  tonight  your staffs inability to deal with an emergency could result in someone s death...  I also hope you contact the patient himself and ensure you look after him well!! #SortItSainsburys 👎🏼;;;;;2016-11-24T01:06:53+0000;1479949613;2016-11-24 02:06:53;6;12;7;1;20;12;3;9;1;0;6;0;0;0;0;1;0

My mum recently visited the store and tried on a few pairs of gloves but couldn t decide which gloves to buy. On returning home she realised my dad s wedding  ring which she has worn since he past away many years ago was missing.  As you can imagine the ring has huge sentimental value and is irreplaceable  Mum returned to the shop and a lovely assistant whos name she couldn t remember  helped to looked for the ring but with no success. They  were very sympathetic and Tracey from customer service  took my mum s phone number and said they would check with their colleague who works in the department and get back to her. When mum returned home their was a message on her phone from Calum to say he had found the ring and has left it at the customer service desk along with a new pair of gloves with their complements. What a lovely gesture and made my mum s day. Excellent customer service please pass this on to your Darnley store.;;;;;2016-11-23T20:54:59+0000;1479934499;2016-11-23 21:54:59;355;46;400;43;489;46;40;6;35;0;355;43;2;0;0;0;0

My father is employed to clean the car park and the rest of the outside space of the store. While he was working on the morning 22.11.16 he was suffering from chest pains  he asked a lot of staff that where starting their shift if they could help him as he was ill. Each staff member just walked past my father and give him a dirty look. My dad was suffering a heart attack at the time he was asking for help and if only one member of staff stopped and spoke to him he would have been diagnosed of being ill and sent to hospital a lot earlier.  I assume that staff at this store is first aid trained. My dad couldn’t either find any staff from the cleaning team to report that he was ill and was leaving the premises to seek medical help.  He had to drive home while suffering from a heart attack. This could have caused a serious accident or tradegy where people lost lifes. When at home my mother saw how bad he was and rang his G.P. His G.P then rang for an ambulance to take him to hospital  when he was assessed by the paramedic of suffering a heart attack and he was blue lighted straight to James Cook hospital  where he was observed by the wonderful staff from the hospital  that afternoon he had to undertake an operation on his heart and had to have two stents fitted. I am really glad my father received the right treatment and is recovering well with the support of the hospital and his family.  I will never shop in Sainsbury’s ever again and hope a lot more people will follow suit because of the rotten treatment of my father suffered in his hour of need.;;;;;2016-11-23T19:28:54+0000;1479929334;2016-11-23 20:28:54;226;237;488;354;1079;230;212;18;262;0;223;4;4;0;73;180;0

Why is Sainsbury’s not doing the same??? Earlier this year  Greenpeace travelled to the Indian Ocean to investigate unsustainable fishing practices and found destructive fishing devices - that kill sharks and turtles and countless other marine life - belonging to Thai Union  the company who owns John West. Yet Sainsbury’s continues to ignore the public’s please and still puts profits before sound business practices and integrity. Is it not important to your company to protect our environment and safeguard our planet for our future generations?

Please can you let me know what that chocolate gooey yummy delicious thing is on your Christmas advert .. I have searched through your web site for at least 30 seconds and I cannot find it. I fear I will loose sleep over this if I do not know. I LOVE your Christmas advert by the way !

Roughly £100 - £130 a week  every week for the past 11 years. As neither me nor my husband drive and now with a 6 week old baby the odd online shop has been a lifesaver and I am normally very happy with the Sainsbury’s service. . However this is the 2nd time I have had reason to complain in the last 4 months. Last night I placed an online order to be delivered today and I am really unhappy with the state my groceries have arrived in. There was a broken custard pot  which I can forgive as accidents do happen. But the custard had leaked out all over the delivery even onto items in other bags. The driver did say he would refund the custard but as I continued to unpack I came across more and more that was covered in custard. In total 14 items had to be washed before I could put them away. In addition to that my sons yoghurts in a different bag had burst or been split too and in a 3rd bag our eggs were broken. Your delivery driver realising that I was becoming more and more unsatisfied only offered the solution of returning my whole order for a full refund. But at this time of night I don’t fancy taking a 6 year old and a 6 week old out to the supermarket to do a week’s shopping I had already done online and already paid for. I didn’t want to return my whole shop… I wanted my whole shop to arrive in a clean usable condition. Too much to ask for???? After your driver left and I continued to unpack my bags I found all my fresh meat looked as though it had been thrown around the store prior to delivery and there was also raw meat products in the same bags as things like cheese and lunch box snacks…. Having worked in the food industry and another main UK supermarket I know this is NOT standard practice nor is it acceptable to store or pack raw meat with other products. Then I found a tray of chicken that has been split open and had raw meat hanging out of it. A red pepper that had clearly been put loose in a bag with heavier items and a great big hole I my Bakewell tart that was for a dinner I am having with my grandparents when they come to visit our new baby (not a very impressive dessert especially without any custard)  broken and snapped asparagus and the list goes on. This is not the kind of service I expect and I will not tolerate it either. I am not stuck with some unusable items  some dirty items and some missing items that I will have to go out and buy making the time I thought I had saved shopping online a complete waste of time. Plus I am going to be out of pocked on a taxi to the store and I dread to think how I will push and buggy and a trolley around the store. All in all this has been a very unpleasant experience. I am really disappointed.;;;;;2016-11-22T22:08:15+0000;1479852495;2016-11-22 23:08:15;2;10;5;0;15;10;6;4;3;0;2;0;1;0;0;2;0

My Boyfriend and I are moving in together this month  and so we had saved up our points all year so we could get some new house stuff. We spoke to a member of staff who told us we could double up £25 to £50 worth of points. After much deliberation  we decided to spend our points on a toaster and kettle. When we then went to redeem our points  another staff member  Rob  was serving. He explained that there was a £40 limit on the points. Rob was really helpful and polite  when scanning the toaster we discovered it was on sale anyway  which only left us with £5 over the £40. Then Rob offered as a gesture of  goodwill  he could take the last £5 off  so we could still get both the items with our points. I want to say thank you so much to Rob  you really made our day! Amazing customer service!;;;;;2016-11-22T21:47:49+0000;1479851269;2016-11-22 22:47:49;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My little boy took ill on Thursday so I phoned 111 who advised me to take him to the hospital. After seeing my little boy so poorly and being physically sick I jumped in my car and headed for A&E. On the way I noticed my petrol light was on so I pulled in to get fuel. I put £25.00 of fuel in and went to pay to find I hadn t picked my purse up...(Yes I should have checked I had means of payment which I thought was in my little boy bag however in the haste of the moment I must have forgot to pick it up as it wasn t!)  After informing the young women at the counter who was very  helpful  in informing me it was a criminal offence and that she would be calling the police who would Pursue me immediately I told her I had to leave and couldn t wait the 30 mins for her to ring the police and carry out the checks etc. I offered for my husband (who was 78 miles away racing down the m6 to meet me at the hospital) to pay over the phone via our joint account to which she replied it wasn t acceptable and someone needed to bring me the money or my purse. I then attempted to return to my car to get my little boy at which point she very loudly told me I couldn t and had to remain in the shop. Obviously I went to get my little boy out of the car to find him being violently sick everywhere. After returning to the shop and cleaning him up the best I could I told her I would be calling the police to tell them I was having to drive off and told them they would find me at the the A&E department. To the very kind young gentleman who offered to lend me the money to enable me to leave to take my little boy to get the help he needed thank you so much. You really are a life saver! I didn t know this chap from Adam and despite offering him my name  address and tel num he just took my num and said he would call me later - which he did and my husband left the money with the neighbour ready for him to collect.  Once the other women working in the Petrol station saw how poorly my little boy was they were very apologetic asking if they could do anything and apologising for adding stress to what was a very stressful situation for me. I know the staff have protocols to follow and I know I could have been pulling a fast one however they could clearly see I was distressed  upset and hopefully genuine. This is my local store  I hold a nectar card which although I didn t have on me it was in my purse I m sure she could have found me on the system somehow.  After speaking to people about my experience they have all said that if they have done it before or knew of someone who has done it they have had to fill a form in and take payment within 24 hours or face being reported to the police. Thankfully after being on a enebaliser for 2 days and then oxygen for a further 24 hours  2 chest X-rays  inhalers and antibiotics my little boy had a severe chest infection and bronchitis. Thankfully after his 2nd chest X-ray this morning it was confirmed he didn t have pneumonia.  We are now finally home but I would just like to show my sheer disgust to the young women in the petrol station that morning. I know I was 100% at fault for having no means of payment on me but there was certainly a better way of dealing with the matter in question! I will be speaking with the store manager but anyone in the same circumstances if you forget your purse expect to be embarrassed in front of a shop full of people and  spoken to by the staff of Sainsburys like a child!;;;;;2016-11-22T21:38:17+0000;1479850697;2016-11-22 22:38:17;3;22;9;1;32;22;7;15;8;0;3;0;0;0;0;6;0

I was dubious as My daughter cut her hand on one of your knives which had been given to us as child friendly but in fact was not suitable for children  this was about 6 months ago and following a complaint  which was resolved  I was assured there is children s cutlery available in your family friendly café s. I was surprised today  when again we asked for children s cutlery  to be presented with the same adult cutlery as before. This is sharper than your usual cutlery as it s for people who are disabled. I challenged staff and was disappointed to be told this is what he d been told to give to children and was the only cutlery available for them. When will children s safety be put first!?!   On a positive note the customer service desk were extremely helpful and accommodating with an exchange I needed to do today. I just wish you d be more accommodating for your younger customers.;;;;;2016-11-22T21:36:46+0000;1479850606;2016-11-22 22:36:46;2;3;2;0;5;3;2;1;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

We d finished our shopping in your Bretton  Peterborough store and my mum and myself were getting my son s coat on. My daughter was stood next to us waiting for her coat to be put on. We hear a huge thud and turn to find my daughter flat out on the floor deathly white. We grabbed her off the floor and she started screaming much to our relief! The security guard near by saw what happened and came over to check she was ok and called for first aid. He waited with us until someone came. A lady called Sue appeared and checked her head  I m not 100% sure if she was first aid but still took us to the pharmacy for my daughter to be checked over. He gave us advice about signs of concussion and we bought some paracetamol to give her straight away. Another lady appeared with a bag of ice from the fish counter for my daughter s head. My daughter was obviously still very upset  so Sue kindly went to find her some chocolate buttons which she gave her for free. And then asked us to go sit in the cafe and got us all a coffee for free too and asked us to stay for a while to make sure my daughter was ok. Sue took my details for the accident book and has said she s going to ring me tomorrow afternoon to check my daughter is still ok. Today was the most scared I ve been since having my daughter - I ve never seen her so pale or look so scared and in pain. Sue was calm  helpful and generous.

The lady was called Namb and she showed an amazing level of customer service. A slightly older lady was in front of me and she was struggling with her shopping. The checkout lady took her time to help the customer load her shopping and then organise and pack it while explaining what she was putting in each bag so the customer knew where everything was when she got home. Your employee apologised to me several times for the wait  but it was just lovely to see someone displaying such care and patience for a customer. Sainsbury s  if you hand out employee of the month awards  this member of staff deserves one  she is a credit to your company.

My girlfriend and I are strictly vegan  due to a combination of dietary requirements and moral reasons. We often shop in our local sainsburys store in bedford and are very happy with the range on offer. Our particular favourite is your  free from  pesto which we eat a couple of times a week. Last week we did our regular shop and picked up our usual pesto  from the  free from   aisle along with pasta and a selection of vegetables.  This evening we decided to roast the veg and stir the pesto in. Not thinking we had to check the jar  we proceeded as usual  chopping up a variety of veg and adding the sauce. To our horror (luckily before we had eaten it) we discovered that the pesto which we had purchased was the original variety  containing cheese. Not only are we having to start cooking again but we have also wasted roughly ten pounds on ingredients that will now be thrown away.  We thoroughly enjoyed shopping regularly in your stores but this evening s events have been a shock. If  for example  I had an allergy to an ingredient in the pesto which we purchased  the end result could have much worse. We look forward to your reply  yours faithfully   James Dudley.;;;;;2016-11-21T19:38:56+0000;1479757136;2016-11-21 20:38:56;2;71;11;3;85;64;30;34;500;0;2;0;1;8;0;0;0

Even Sainsburys own label tuna is caught by the hook & line method  I m sure if they removed John West Tuna from their shelves sales of their own brand would rise.

By continuing to sell John West tuna you are contributing to the destruction of the marine environment and the demise of the local fisheries who depend on the availability of fish for their food and income. In addition to that  it is a well known fact that the fishing methods used by John West (FADS) to catch large amount of tunas of all sizes (including small tunas) generate a huge amount of bi-catch including turtles  dolphins and sharks. For these reasons I cannot further condone your behaviour and I urge you to take responsibility for your actions and stop stocking John West products or persuade them to source their tuna responsibly. Despite having been a long term customer of yours  I have now decided that I will no longer shop in your stores and I will make it my mission to persuade my friends and family to do the same. These times call for responsible and often tough decisions to be made by everyone in order to preserve our planet for future generations. I am making mine  are you going to do the same?

Finally been moved to write about my Raspberry and White Chocolate cookie experience.  Once upon a time they were so awesome I could eat a whole pack to myself in a day 😳 But for a while now I ve been giving the bakery the benefit of the doubt  build up my excitement that this time they will be perfect again  and yet again been disappointed.  Has the recipe changed?   They seem overly sweet and the sugar isn t helping the baking process as they are also more crunchy than soft cookie. Which also isn t helped if they are overbaked.  Plus there are less white chocolate bits in and as for the raspberry - even David Attenborough would have a hard time finding it 😢 They were the only thing making my Uni assignments bearable but now in my last year I can t have anything distracting my work so sadly might have to search elsewhere for something to replace them.   Or can you change the recipe back?🙏🏻;;;;;2016-11-20T18:05:53+0000;1479665153;2016-11-20 19:05:53;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

After mentioning to the lady on self service she informed us it was a problem with the card machines. So we went to the cash point got cash and paid for the shopping.

Congratulations to Sainsbury s for taking the plunge and introducing vinyl albums in your stores  with my nectar double up I had already earmarked several albums to restart and enhance my collection. I went in store and looked at what I wanted to buy  and I was a little concerned as to the way they were merchandised. Earlier this year I was in your Exeter store and saw you were selling vinyl there  but these were displayed in bins where you could flip happily through   the ones displayed in your Fareham Broadcut store were placed overlapping on shelves no wider than two inches wide...  when I saw it I thought that this is a disaster waiting to happen  and sure enough it did within two minutes someone came along picked a record from one end and twenty plus albums fell to the floor  I helped to put them back on the shelf and looked through carefully taking albums out and looking at the track listing. I did notice some damage on the David Bowie albums which were my target to buy on the double up. A week later I am in and looking again at the albums  all the damaged albums are still there on the shelf  I sorted them out and took them over to the service desk and explained the damage to the assistant and as far as I could see they put them out of the way. I was in again on Thursday to choose my albums for the double up  all the albums I was going to choose were badly damaged  they were hunky dory lp  and Aladdin sane by bowie  and welcome to the pleasure dome by frankie goes to Hollywood..... I chose other lps that were undamaged. By different artistes. Not Happy.... The point I am making is that these albums are a premium price and are being treated like bags of spuds  what was worse was the albums I had given to the assistant as damaged were back out on display STILL DAMAGED!!! Come on get your act sorted out  get your merchandising sorted out and make sure that if damaged goods are re-merchandised they are reduced in price to reflect the damage and state the damage..... I shop in broadcut on a regular basis and I will be raising this issue with the store management as an unacceptable practice.;;;;;2016-11-19T22:22:16+0000;1479594136;2016-11-19 23:22:16;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I explained it would have been nice if the store had actually told me it would be closing when I was there during the week previously.   They apologised and said that I needed to look on the Sainsbury website to check if a store is open.  After #lol “I said she must be joking  you are expecting me to check your every time I want to go shopping?”. Realising that was not such a clever answer the apologised again and said that we make a note and let their internal teams know. I then asked what does that mean and they just repeated the statement.  I was on the call for over 15 minutes and they never even asked for my name.  I estimate that thousands of customers have turned up to the store only to find it closed.

I was ordering Christmas presents for family and had pre-arranged which items I would buy for their children so had to be organised. I can honestly say  it was the worst and most time consuming order I have ever made. I thought it would be easier and quicker to buy the items online  with the ease of walking instore and picking it all up at once.  Unfortunately  due to an error on your systems  my payment wasn t processed. I wasn t contacted to say there was an issue with my order and so I went in store to collect my items before I was informed of your error. By this point your event had finished and so I was directed to your website  for the customer service team. When I spoke to them I was told that they could offer an evoucher for the saving I would have received  however all the items online were out of stock. So I would have to look for the items myself in store. And so the evoucher would prove pointless. I requested that I have the items located so I could pick them up in store  which I was told would happen. So I emailed over my most convenient stores and then received an email with the evoucher not long after. After a week of hearing nothing else about the instore stock  I emailed again to ask why I hadn t heard anything and was told that I had received the evoucher  but that wasn t the point!  This is the worst customer service I have ever received. I m fed up now. I have been running round in circles for 2 weeks and I just want this fixed as soon as possible. Are you able to offer any help  because I am at my wits end?  Kind regards  Justine  Order 3051500;;;;;2016-11-19T11:15:11+0000;1479554111;2016-11-19 12:15:11;0;2;0;0;2;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was in the queue  and the customer two in front of myself was a young male with tattoos on his neck and arms. A very smart  well dressed young guy not that this should make any difference. Anyway once he had left the till  the customer in front said  oh did you see those horrible tattoos . The cashier (Jill I think she was called) replied oh I know  weren t they dreadful. The two of them went on to have a conversation about this customer (who had just spent money in your store) in a horrible and judgemental way  stating the tattoos look ugly and make him look dirty (with absolutely no effort to be quiet). The conversation then went on to how the cashier thought all tattoos are horrible  particularly ok girls. Now I don t care what anyone thinks of my personal choices  but they should care about those either but I have tattoos myself. The first conversation would have definitely caused offence to the customer and the second comments could have quite easily offended myself. They didn t  but it s angered me and disgusted me. I work in retail myself as an area manager for Aldi  and if I thought for once moment that a staff member would speak to a customer to blatantly about another staff I d be disgusted.  I reported this to customer services at the time in store  who did agree it wasn t acceptable however I have come home and got angrier and angrier about this. I saw the customer outside and almost told him but I didn t actually want him to know what small minded people had said about him.;;;;;2016-11-18T19:10:42+0000;1479496242;2016-11-18 20:10:42;4;4;6;0;10;4;4;0;1;0;4;0;0;0;0;2;0

When she asked them whether they would mind moving  they refused and then just ignored her. I think this is totally unacceptable. When another space finally became available she parked and then reported this in store  who then did nothing about it. When she left the store  the car was still parked in the Parent and Child space. I m really not happy about this Sainsbury s.;;;;;2016-11-18T16:07:53+0000;1479485273;2016-11-18 17:07:53;0;5;3;0;8;5;1;4;0;0;0;0;3;0;0;0;0

As one of the market leaders in allergy awareness  maybe the best I ve found so far  I cannot understand why you would take this step backwards leaving us once again trying to source a safe alternative that is becoming increasing difficult.

Every tiny reduction in plastic packaging is useful. So you might think I m daft but ... take a look at the Sainsbury s extra care soft toothbrush. You could HALVE the plastic in that wrapper: it doesn t need a plastic bubble both sides  just 1 transparent side backed with flat card. And how many more products could reduce plastic packaging  especially in food? Please. This is important. Remember how consumers and producers reduced and largely got rid of damaging CFC propellants.

I was at the Woodhall Farm Sainsbury s in Hemel Hempstead with my mum about an hour ago when I started to feel REALLY faint. This is common for me  I m generally pretty faint or lightheaded if I haven t eaten (which I hadn t). I can usually breathe through it until I can get round to eating something  but this time around I couldn t. I ended up laying myself down outside the store  as sitting upright was too difficult.  Amazingly the first person to approach me was a paramedic! I never caught his name but I d love to thank him for keeping me calm before the Sainsbury s staff came out.  I can t express enough gratitude to the staff members that talked me through my fainting episode  helped me off the cold ground  brought me inside  fed me tea and toast in a quiet area of the store and chatted with me until I felt loads better.  I especially want to thank Natalie who got me through the entire thing while so wonderfully friendly. As I felt better and got up to leave with my mum  Natalie gave me a huge box of shortbread biscuits and told me to eat! I can t get over how generous Natalie and the rest of the staff were (in my dizzy state I forgot their names!) and I wanted to be able to thank them properly. Sainsbury s have incredible customer service  especially at Woodhall Farm where it is truly like a family there within their staff  and that should never be overlooked.  I ll definitely be back in there to thank them all personally. The shortbread biscuits have worked a treat!  Thank you so much  it may not feel like it to you  but what you did for me was nothing short of heroic.  Biiiiig love.;;;;;2016-11-18T11:45:19+0000;1479469519;2016-11-18 12:45:19;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I made the cakes with little fuss  and  even though I find icing cakes to be one of the most arduous tasks in the world  I even managed to get the pink icing to look half decent . Feeling rather proud of my accomplishment I added the milk chocolate buttons to the top and considered it a job well done  until... I realised  staring back at me  on the plate  were 6 iced cake boobs of varying size. This was confirmed by Julie  my mother  who I assure you will never let me live this down!   Now  I m not sure who thought it would be a good idea to have pink iced cupcakes and chocolate buttons to decorate them  but I can assume the teachers at my son s school would have probably not agreed.   I would post a picture of the offending cakes but I think that it might be reported and removed due to it containing  nudity .  Luckily after many baking mishaps I have an array of cake decorations in the cupboard and so disaster has been avoided.   To avoid potential embarrassment for others in the future  you may wish to add a warning to the box  change the icing colour or maybe rebrand as hen-do cup cakes?

At the checkout i asked the Assistant to take £10 worth of Nectar points off my card towards the shop  which she did  and then asked if i knew about the Double Up offer.  Apparently i could have doubled my points to get £20 off my clothing.. I wasn t aware of it  and apparently at that point it was too late to do anything about it as she d already taken the points. As this is a scheme only running for a week  is it really Sainsburys policy for your Checkout staff to only ask if the customers know about it AFTER they ve already removed the points and its impossible to get them doubled?

Went in today at 2pm to collect a parcel (that should have been there at nine but didn t get the email to collect til nearly 1pm) and after using your touch screen I waited and waited and waited. By 2.15 I queued at customer services and eventually got served and a woman came out who initially tried to imply u didn t use the screen properly (I had  and I wasn t the only person waiting!) But she re did it all and went off to collect it. And then when she did bring it out she apologised and said my order hadn t been sent to her device  but had been sent to two devices that weren t in use! But then it took even longer as her device wouldn t scan any of the barcodes! 35 minutes it took to collect a parcel! It s not the staffs fault  it s the rubbish equipment that Sainsbury s are providing them!

Me and my son were happily tucking into lunch... me and jacket potato and him a children s chicken and sweet corn sandwich.... I went to give him another piece and ate the other half myself only to find a really sharp piece of bone in it! Obviously I rushed to take the rest of the sandwich off him  resulting in a massive melt down.  After speaking to a member of staff who offered me a new sandwich and informed me that it warns you on the back. In very small print.  To be honest I feel this warning is not big enough. My son doesn t understand not to eat a bone. It would be very messy to check the whole sandwich myself. I free this filling is not an appropriate thing to advertising suitable for a child and could of ended very badly for us today.

I went in to double up the Nectar points I have been saving all year to spend at Christmas  you only had 2 people working on your customer service desk and a massive que! There was another man swanning around  helping  people with doubling up their points but not actually doing anything. When the lady behind me asked if there was anyone else to help on the service desk he said that the other 2 people that should be on there had  had to go and help elsewhere in the store then walked off with a massive smile on his face. This was not helpful  especially as my 2 year old was crying and screaming in my trolley. Both the ladies on the desk were dealing what could only be difficult refund/exchanges as they seemed to be there for ages  in the end I just left  leaving my trolley of shopping there as I couldn t waiting any longer. So thank you Sainburys you have cost me more this Christmas as it is very doubtful I will be able to make it back to a store before your double up event ends!!!!;;;;;2016-11-17T12:20:35+0000;1479385235;2016-11-17 13:20:35;0;5;0;0;5;5;1;4;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I rang Nectar and they promised to send me a new card with my points transferred onto it. I also had a series of coupons from Sainsbury s though so I rang Sainsbury s. The coupons ran for 4 weeks  I had already used week 1  spending £60+ and receiving a coupon for 12p off each litre of fuel I bought  which I also used. Week 2 was spend £60  save £6  weeks 3 and 4 were repeats of weeks 1 and 2. If I used all 4 I would get 500 free points. I rang my local Sainsbury s  they said I couldn t use the vouchers without the card that was stolen. I rang customer services  same result. Nectar weren t interested because they weren t their coupons. Sainsbury s can afford to throw away a minimum of £220 worth of my business  based on a minimum spend of £60 for 3 weeks and £40 fuel for my car. Is my business really that worthless to Sainsbury s? In these days of strong competition from your competitors I would have expected to value loyal customers. My mother has shopped at Sainsbury s for over 50 years but we weren t even allowed to use my vouchers with her card. It s not what I would call good customer service!;;;;;2016-11-16T19:49:11+0000;1479325751;2016-11-16 20:49:11;0;4;0;0;4;4;1;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Concerned I might not be able to use the card in a petrol station I checked on your own website first and found https://www.sainsburysgifts.co.uk/excluded_products.html that it is not listed. I thought if not listed as an excluded product then it is fairly reasonable to assume that it is permissible to use for fuel.  The card arrived today and the first sentence on the back says it cannot be used in petrol stations. Not much use after its already been bought. First sentence on the back of the card. Doesn t crack the top 15 on the excluded products list. You should probably rectify that.;;;;;2016-11-16T19:22:53+0000;1479324173;2016-11-16 20:22:53;0;6;0;0;6;6;1;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

You really need to look at your system for double up! To only be able to double £20 to £40 as a maximum and have to do each voucher in a single transaction was an absolute bloody nightmare! I had my 1 yr old daughter kicking off a rude customer service agent on the desk who didn t know what she was doing and I had £85 that I was changing up across clothing and technology.  So stressful and have to say I very much doubt I will use this double up event again.  Tesco have a much better system where you double your points get vouchers and it all goes through with your shopping.;;;;;2016-11-16T15:08:07+0000;1479308887;2016-11-16 16:08:07;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Had a call from my Nan asking if I had £10 or more worth in nectar points as Sainsbury s have a  double up  scheme through nectar and she wanted a blouse and knew she d technically get it free if she could use my nectar points. I thought why not I can also get myself a clothing item considering I ll have double the amount of money.  I went to Sainsbury s westhoughton  went over to the customer service desk and asked for my double points in clothes vouchers. The lady at the desk gave me two vouchers the top one being a £10 clothing voucher so I assumed I wouldn t have to check the second one underneath as that should also be a £10 clothing voucher as well making it a total of £20 in clothing vouchers hence your double up nectar points scheme. We picked up what we wanted and made our way to the check out  I automatically handed over both vouchers to my disbelief have one of them handed back to me  I read on the voucher it said   £18 off delivery  on the voucher. To this point I was confused paid the lady at the till only getting £10 off the clothes instead of £20. I asked my Nan surely I should have had £20 in vouchers not £10 as it s a double up scheme. So we went back to the customer service desk to be served by the same lady. Mucking us about was an understatement  first of all she was pretty much accusing me of lying claiming I only ask for £10 in clothing vouchers to which I asked her why would I ask for £10 when I asked for the double points scheme! She then went to refund one of the items to then give us another £10 voucher but the item she refunded us was under £10 and asked if I could go and get a chocolate bar or a packet of crisps to round up the amount to £10 to which I had to run around looking for a couple of kitkats to make it a pound so it was rounded to £10. She scanned them and said oh sorry you can t have these with the voucher as it s clothing which I would have thought she would have already knew that anyway to then ask me for a £1 to then refund it and then she was asking me to go back in the clothing department and look for something else that s a £1 so she could allow me to buy my item back and then refund this £1 again! So there s me running around like an idiot to try and find something that was a £1 in the clothing department that I didn t want to get in the first place just so I could get it refunded to then get my item back!  So Sainsbury s I recommend that in future you educate your staff on how to double up points/money  make sure they check what they have printed off for their customers and maybe not muck their customers about making them running all over the shop floors! 😡😡😡😡;;;;;2016-11-16T11:38:29+0000;1479296309;2016-11-16 12:38:29;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Yesterday I went to the large sainsburys in crawley and ended up purchasing some clothes for my little boy  I could nt really afford them but I decided to use my 27.50 of points. No where in the store was there anything saying it was double points  not one poster or anything advertising it.. I was not told at the till when i purchased the items either even though they must of known! I had to go back today to change the sizes of a couple of items.  At the customer service desk where I was queing there was a leaflet about double points up this november  while i stood there reading it I couldnt beleive that i had missed out on this the 27.50 could have been 50!  I asked if I could have it exchanged with points and was told there was nothing I could do.  I have spent ages saving my points and this is how I am repayed! I am gutted as thats alot of money I have missed out on.  I am so disappointed that I will tomorrow return all my clothing items to sainsburys and never shop there again.  When you shop in tesco it is very very clear when they have a promotion on!!!! DISGUSTED;;;;;2016-11-15T20:24:27+0000;1479241467;2016-11-15 21:24:27;1;11;2;0;13;11;3;8;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;1;0

Don t get me wrong I LOVE James Corden however the warm Christmas message I have become used to just wasn t there.   I m sure from your First World War advert of 2014 you understand how much of an impact you can make from your Christmas advert. The message you bring can help make our world a greater place by raising money and awareness. Unfortunately you haven t done that this year.   I have written you a Christmas advert for 2017 that I hope you enjoy.... let s bring awareness to homelessness next Christmas.   It opens up with people shopping  laughing  having coffee through the window of the shop.  A song is sung all accoutically and slow. There s a little girl about 8 years old but she isn t looking at the bright christmas tree or the toys in the shop  she sees the homeless people  the people who are really struggling.   The little girl comes home and writes her list to santa  Dear santa  for christmas this year please help people who don t have homes  the parents see the list and are overcome with emotion.   The shot goes to a few homeless people waking up to cards sitting on their rucksack/trolley. They open the cards and tears roll down their cheeks.   Back to the little girl  she s setting the table  opening the last window in her advent calender. She s sad  she got a bike for christmas but her wish didn t come true.   The doorbell rings.   She perks up... who could this be?  In come the homeless people and she had the biggest smile on her face.   There s a montage of eating christmas dinner  pulling crackers and general warm happiness.  The advert ends with the little girl looking out the window to see Santa s sleigh flying past and she whispers  thanks Santa    Christmas is for sharing   Now obviously I am not a writer but you could do something to help raise awareness. When you release that advert you could make sure every store has a donation box for food banks  the song sung in the advert could be a charity single raising money for a homeless charity  sell hats/scarves/gloves cheap to be donated.   You have the power to raise awareness with your Christmas advert... Use it.

I am writing to inform you that I will no longer be shopping at Sainsbury’s until your company withdraws all advertising from The Daily Mail newspaper. I am disappointed to hear that you will not reconsider your advertising policy unlike the Co-Operative Supermarket  who are currently reviewing its advertising partners due to concerns from customers. Lego also announced on Saturday that they will withdraw their advertising campaigns in The Daily Mail which has gained the company a huge amount of respect and gratitude from its customers. Thousands of positive comments can be read on their Facebook page and Twitter account. What a great endorsement for Lego!  The Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday’s editorial have behaved despicably in recent years by promoting messages of hatred towards vulnerable and minority groups.  Their style of reporting is deliberately meant to create fear and resentment; very little of what is printed in this publication is based on fact. For example  their recent coverage of child refugees being transported from the Calais “jungle” involved the use of an inaccurate age-recognition app in order to determine their ages with the implication being that grown adults were pretending to be minors in order to gain access to the UK. Such treatment of young people is completely inappropriate  not to mention the fact that it negates The UN Convention on The Rights of The Child. Additionally  as a school teacher who works with many young people who happen to be asylum seekers and refugees  I find this treatment of young people personally upsetting.  It is not only ethnic minorities that are victim to the publication’s despicable treatment. In 2013  courts ruled that school teacher  Lucy Meadows committed suicide in March earlier that year  as a result of her gender reassignment being outed by the national press. Michael Singleton  the coroner for Blackburn  Hyndburn and Rossendale  described the Daily Mail as having carried out a campaign of  ridicule and humiliation  as well as character assassination  of the young woman. The style of reporting adopted by the paper is actively ruining people’s lives and such hate campaigns should not be funded by a well-respected British company such as yours.  It is clear to me that the vitriol and hostility displayed in The Daily Mail is immediately at odds with your company values  particularly those promoted in your advertising campaigns which celebrate ideas of peace  togetherness and the acceptance of difference. The Daily Mail seeks to deliberately create divisions between various groups of people in our society which is of great concern considering the recent rise in hate crimes in the United Kingdom. Wouldn’t you agree that being associated with this newspaper could harm the image of your brand and that advertising in their publications could be counter-productive in the long-term?  I understand that retailers sometimes do not feel the need to question their advertisers’ political view but I feel that the blatant hostility shown towards refugees and Asylum Seekers by The Mail’s editorial goes beyond politics. I am fully aware that all publications are within their rights to express political and ideological bias but I feel in the case of the newspaper in question  they have gone too far and are consistently breaking codes of conduct without facing the consequences. As an advertiser for the newspaper  Sainsbury’s has the influence to encourage our press to change for the better and help restore a sense common decency which sadly seems to have evaporated in recent years as far as the tabloid press are concerned.  I sincerely hope that Sainsbury’s will review how and where it advertises. Until then  I will not be spending money in any of your stores and will continue to make public my views on the subject.  Many thanks    Anwen Ebenezer";;;;;2016-11-13T22:07:05+0000;1479074825;2016-11-13 23:07:05;2;1;4;0;5;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;2;0;0;0

He couldn t find my house (despite the fact that Sainsbury s have delivered to me several times before and I have other deliveries every day). He phoned me twice when I was in the middle of bathing my children. I gave him directions twice but he was unable to follow them. The directions were simple from where he was -  go behind the bungalow and through the red gates . I told him this at least ten times. The second time he phoned me  I was on the phone to him for 5 minutes  whilst my child was left in the bath  I was saying over and over  go behind the bungalow and through the red gates . He then asked if I could go and meet him on the main road. I explained that I was in my pyjamas and couldn t leave the children. He was obviously on the phone whilst driving.

The wife was furious and my young son had to resort to foraging for nuts and seeds in the back garden for his lunch (he s only 1  but he ll out-forage me every day of the week).   What could I do to right this terrible wrong my incompetence had bestowed upon my family?   *Light bulb moment*   I had a £10 off voucher when I did my shopping online (on the condition that I used it before 19/11/16 and spent over £50). Now  I have checked the date several times in the last few hours and according to my... Er  the wife s  Justin Bieber calendar - it is still 13/11/16  so the overseers of time are on my side.  YES!  I shrieked. The wife briefly looked away from MasterChef long enough to give me a deathly stare  as she sat hungry in a grocery-less house.  The only caveat remaining would be that I need to spend over £50  and let me tell you  I shall do that with gusto and ease. If only there were a scenario requiring me to spend under £50 - now that would be a challenge  with my young son clicking  add to trolley  for the 17th time on a pack of drawstring bin liners. I like bin liners as much as the next man (maybe more) but that s a little too many even for me.  I digress.  I had loaded all of my groceries into my trolley and proceeded to checkout.  I will be a hero   I thought smugly. This was all going too well. I declared to my wife that I had solved the problem and that soon we would be basking in cupboards full of non-perishables and fresh fruit/vegetables. She smiled. A SMILE!! My son gave me a high-five. Wow. I was a demigod. I was Epaphus  or Helen of Troy. It is a weekend after all - don t judge me  And then it all came crashing down. I was greeted with the terrible news that my voucher had expired. How could this be? I had met all the required criteria. How would I break the news to the family that our shopping had all of a sudden become more expensive?  Crestfallen and defeated  I turned the laptop off. I am but a man - a mortal man who can t use a voucher correctly. You are my only hope - my salvation  if you will. Can you assist me?;;;;;2016-11-13T15:10:34+0000;1479049834;2016-11-13 16:10:34;4;5;7;0;12;5;2;3;0;0;4;0;0;3;0;0;0

Took an age to clean everything up.Sainsbury need to rethink the quality of their cake boxes  before I will buy anymore.;;;;;2016-11-13T12:16:47+0000;1479039407;2016-11-13 13:16:47;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I felt the need to write a review after a recent trip to my local Sainsbury s Saltisford in Warwick on Wednesday 09th Nov @ approx 7.30pm.  I was in a rush as always but needed to stop by to check my lottery ticket and buy some stamps before heading out to see an old friend that night.   I approached the kiosk and was greeted by a big smile from your lovely colleague Sue? (Smaller lady with short blonde hair) Now this is my local JS but I haven t seen this lady working on the kiosk before.  Anyway what was intended to be a quick pit stop turned out to be one of the most heartfelt occasions..  I ve never made it public to family and friends before.. but I suffer with anxiety and I am certainly not the most confident person on the planet.. but I had made a special effort that night as I was going out for drinks with an old friend which doesn t happen often enough. Sue looked at me smiling  eyes lit up and said  well don t you look lovely  I laughed it off as I m not used to somebody being so attentive. She went on to say  you look gorgeous  I love your eye make up with that touch of glitter .. I immediately smiled back and said  thank you  that s the kindest thing a strangers said to me in a while  she waved me off and told me to have a great evening and make the most of it.  I did just that! I walked out that store with my head held higher than it has been in a long time. Suddenly I felt great again.. confident..  so I just wanted to say to Sue  thank you! It s the little things in life that matter and all it took was a 2minute conversation and she had made my week. She didn t have to say anything.. but I m glad she did.  I m a firm believer that what goes around comes around and if anything she deserves employee of the month!   Thank you for being you Sue. I loved Sainsbury s before but now I have even more reason to smile when I shop there.   ☺️;;;;;2016-11-13T11:53:29+0000;1479038009;2016-11-13 12:53:29;384;99;443;20;562;99;79;20;236;0;383;59;0;0;0;0;0

Just over a week ago we paid the Upton store a visit while in England in the hope to deliver a  thank you  card to Ryan Pierce  Mike Paterson and Geraldine for their willingness to help my unwell father in-law that was in hospital recently. Not only did they deliver on that help at the time  but they went more than the extra mile....Furthermore  just when I thought that they couldn t do anymore for us  we were bowled over by the welcome we got when visiting. Ryan  Geraldine and Customer Service Manager  Brenda offered us coffee and cake  gave us two beautiful bouquets of flowers and vowed to help our unwell and ageing family with a tailored service going into the future. Ryan Pierce subsequently told us that he couldn t accept a cash gift that we wanted to give so instead bought 50 selection boxes out of it for the children who are in Arrowe Park hospital!!! It is very clear to us that Sainsbury s Upton contradicts the stereotype of large companies taking from communities  and instead shows us that community spirit and customer loyalty is at the core of their business. It is also clear that these types of people are the unsung heroes in our neighbourhoods  and this whole story is a true example of pulling together to do a good deed - even if it is outside the normal remit.  Well done AGAIN Sainsbury s!!;;;;;2016-11-12T20:16:49+0000;1478981809;2016-11-12 21:16:49;378;4;413;46;463;4;3;1;33;0;377;35;0;0;0;0;0

It s not your delicous produce  your prices or your excellent instore service. It s your advertising choices.  I wouldn t consider myself a political person but I do believe that a line has to be drawn. And when British mainstream newspapers start replicating headlines from state sponsored propaganda in NAZI GERMANY  I believe we ve probably passed that line. While most of us were apathetically not paying attention.  And so it was with great sadness that I discovered that you were spending millions of pounds on advertising in the daily mail  express and sun. For a company whose corporate commitments include  diversity and inclusion  and that supports such worthwhile causes as  humanitarian aid  through the work of family trusts such as the Linbury trust  to be funding newspapers that demand  BRITAIN MUST BAN MIGRANTS  and refer to them as  THE SWARM ON OUR STREETS  is unfathomable.   I would urge you to reconsider your advertising choices and target this budget to publications that uphold the values you claim to hold. I believe that if we  as a country  are to turn back from the dangerous path we appear to be headed down then individuals like me need to make difficult choices that in this case will see me trudging round Morrisons with a 3 year old and 1 year old rather than benefitting from your convenient home delivery. However  more significantly  companies like yourselves need to use the  scale of your business  to contribute positively to the wider world.   Please withdraw funding from the daily mail  express and sun so that I can rebuild my relationship with you because  apart from anything else  I bloody love your pizzas.;;;;;2016-11-12T20:08:35+0000;1478981315;2016-11-12 21:08:35;11;22;13;2;37;22;8;14;9;0;11;0;1;0;0;1;0

I was with my mum and also my 2 year old son (who was very awake & in to everything! ).   My mum & I queued up at the till  I went first and her after me. Don t ask me how  but in some confusion in us leaving the store  we managed to leave my shopping behind at the till. Neither if us realised until 3 hours later when I finally arrived home.   I called the store & spoke to Ben  who was amazing. I was so worried as I don t have the money to do a replacement shop  but he reassured me he had my shopping  & he d replace any chilled or frozen items I had in my bag.   I just wanted to say a massive thank you to Ben. I cried when I found out I d got all the way home with no food  but he was brilliant and is a real credit to sainsburys. If you have a reward system for your employees  I d definitely recommend him. Thanks Ben!;;;;;2016-11-12T15:55:58+0000;1478966158;2016-11-12 16:55:58;7;0;7;0;7;0;0;0;0;0;7;0;0;0;0;0;0

Last night I went to do my online order only to find that now they have removed the Sainsburys Tomato  red pepper and lentil chilled soup as well. This means there are now only 2 vegan soups in their chilled range. During the last month or so  the Sainsburys Tarka Dhal tinned soup (which was gorgeous) has been removed  as has the Swedish Glace strawberry soy icecreams (5 indivual icecreams on sticks) and the Almond Dream Salted Caramel  icecream  . At least I can get the last two from Waitrose for the moment. Also the Basic Baby Lotion has been removed and I cannot find any moisturing lotion suitable for women that has the Leaping Bunny cruelty free symbol on it. One is restriced enough when trying to buy cruelty free products but it is upsetting when the few you like and rely on disappear without warning. If you have to reduce the number of products on the shelves  try removing some of the non-vegan or vegetarian products. There are masses of them to choose from and they cannot all be wonderful sellers. If the vegan products are not moving very well  you could try a  cruelty free promotion  and put them all together in store for a short time. I am sure that many people would be willing to buy cruelty free products if they were easier to find.;;;;;2016-11-12T07:44:24+0000;1478936664;2016-11-12 08:44:24;0;6;0;0;6;6;3;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We have been Tesco quite a lot recently nd my daughter loves it and works wonder in keeping her quiet & occupied whilst shopping  plus its healthier than bags of crisps or sweets being put out! The reason I ask is because we decided we were going to try Sainsbury s for the first time in a while because as a family we enjoy the quality and foods Saonsburys as to offer. We went in and my daughter ran straight for the fruit  picked up a banana and tried to open it  i had to take it off her  I was about to go buy it but queues at the kiosk and self service were really bad and couldn t spend ages queuing for a banana to then shop & queue again! So I put it back which resulted in a crazy tantrum. I m not ones foe giving in to tantrums but it made shopping impossible  I ended up leaving 🙈 but was just a thought as it is a great idea and fab to offer something healthy to kids due to how many families that are struggling and so many children have a poor diet! Thoughts?;;;;;2016-11-12T07:01:43+0000;1478934103;2016-11-12 08:01:43;5;15;5;0;20;15;4;11;5;0;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

I expect a little more after being assaulted by someone s ineptitude.  Perhaps  start store end of day closing when customers are not around as this is dangerous.

My husband was in one of your stores yesterday  and went to the cafeteria to buy a sandwich for lunch.  Unfortunately  there were none left in the cafeteria so he selected a wrap from the fridges in store and went back to the canteen where he selected a muffin and a cappuccino to have with the wrap.  He was told that he wasn t allowed to eat the wrap in the canteen (even though it was a Sainsbury s one - and bearing in mind the cafeteria had nothing to offer).  Is this normal Sainsbury s policy?

The assistant took her to the check out and the check out clerk said he did not recognise her. So now we have to wait for two days while the check the till. What is to stop the check out clerk from pocketing the £30? Nothing. Thank you Sainsbury s.;;;;;2016-11-11T17:46:08+0000;1478886368;2016-11-11 18:46:08;0;19;0;0;19;19;5;14;13;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

You recently sent out an email with a healthy eating survey attached  to get some extra Nectar points. You might find your results are slightly skewed as some of the field validation rules were incorrect. For example  when I entered 0 for number of children it said I had to enter at least 1. I don t have a child (though there s one on the way!). The next question was the age of the child. I figured I d enter 0 since baby isn t born yet. Again I found I could only enter 1 as a minimum. Just thought you d better know incase you re doing some stats based on the data you ve collected.;;;;;2016-11-11T13:22:15+0000;1478870535;2016-11-11 14:22:15;2;5;2;0;7;5;1;4;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

It is  Armistice Day.    There was a lady selling Poppy s in the foyer  she was freezing cold and when asked told me it was Sainsbury s company policy not to allow Poppy s to be sold inside the store. So she had to stand outside.  I find this absolutely disgraceful and said as much to Customise Services. The lady at CS said it wasn t that cold in the foyer and it was heated. It was absolutely freezing.  The queue of people behind me at CS found this equally disgusting and said so.  She said she would mention it to the manager....  Sainsbury s   you should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves  to make a lady selling Poppy s stand outside in the cold when it would make no difference to your store for her to be stood inside is  disgusting.  After I had complained the lady was allowed to stand inside but for me to have to ask for this to happen is appalling and disgraceful.  Today you have lost quite a few customers. You need to review your company policies and make changes otherwise I expect you ll lose a lot more.;;;;;2016-11-11T11:29:48+0000;1478863788;2016-11-11 12:29:48;2;8;2;2;12;8;4;4;4;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I find  all your delivery drivers polite   helpful and friendly.  I don t often have items substituted   however   when I do   is when my problems start.  Perhaps you could give extra  common sense   training to the people you employ to pick out the shopping   as some of them clearly need it.  If I select three bags of 500g grated mature cheddar on my shopping list   does it not stand to reason that I need around 1500g of grated cheddar in total?  Yes?  No.  Apparently not.  Thank you   so much   for the three bags of 250g grated cheddar you instead sent me.  It s so very useful to me to receive half of what I required.  This may not seem like a big deal   and I agree   it s very minimal in the grand scheme of things. However  I use your service for its convenience and so that I don t have to trek out into a crowded supermarket with a potential timebomb of a 2 year old in tow. This  convenience   is now rendered moot: I have to trek out (in the snow)  to buy the rest of the cheese I need.  Nor is this the first time   if it were  I probably wouldn t be typing this right now.  In the past I have requested nappies in a certain size  only to be sent them in a completely different (and totally useless) size.  Honestly   do the people who do this job think parents want nappies that do not fit their child?  Either supply the correct size in a different brand   or don t bother at all.  Various other stupid substitutes you have sent me (and often charged me more than the original item for)  help to build the aggravation I feel right now.  I hope you take note of my points.  I expect you will not. However  next time you are looking for staff  I have a 12 year old son who displays more intelligence selecting alternative items than some of your existing trained monkeys.;;;;;2016-11-09T10:23:34+0000;1478687014;2016-11-09 11:23:34;2;2;2;0;4;2;2;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Why is this important?  Plastic cotton bud stems are the number one item of plastic  sewage-related debris on our beaches and rivers [1] - yet retailers could help prevent this by switching the stick from plastic to paper.  In the marine environment  plastics can be eaten by marine life  often with fatal consequences. Plastic is found in the stomachs of Loggerhead Turtles  Seabirds and many species of UK-caught fish. And pieces that don t get eaten break down into microplastics  forming part of a dangerous plastic smog in our seas.  Retailers are listening - earlier this year  Waitrose and Johnson & Johnson announced they d make the change to paper  and the Coop and Marks and Spencers sell paper-stem buds. Now we need to make sure the others do the same.  Tesco  Sainsburys  Boots  ASDA  Morrisons  Lidl  Aldi  Superdrug and Wilko are currently reviewing their policies on cotton buds ... which is why we need to show them how many of us support the switch to paper!  Even paper stem cotton buds shouldn’t be flushed down the loo. But if they are  they re less likely to pass through sewage filters and will quickly biodegrade if they escape;;;;;2016-11-08T20:53:06+0000;1478638386;2016-11-08 21:53:06;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I hopped on down to your store in Trowbridge to buy a few bits  including my husband and I s beloved make your own pizza. They are no doubt the best value pizza s out there  total class. Our usual order? 14  thin  BBQ sauce  chicken and double peppers - simple yet effective  I think you ll agree. Oh and always wrapped so we can have it super hot and melty straight away at home. Perfection. When I got to the counter there was a young lady and a very tall gentleman who I assume was a manager of sorts due to how he was speaking to the young lady. He wrote down my order  said it would be 5 minutes  so off I went and picked up my other bits. I returned around 5 minutes later to find the tall man speaking in an ad-hoc meeting with the young lady and two other counter staff. My pizza had not been made. No bother  I know it doesn t take long to do. The young lady then proceeded to make it with me waiting. It was handed to me upside down as it was right off the vacuum thingy. I have just properly looked at it  having taken the wrapper off. Definitely not double peppers  and to my utter horror it has been made with a tomato base  not BBQ. I have this evening been severely deprived. Tomato base is just not for me; I live for a BBQ base. Now whose fault was it? The young lady being mildly berated by a manager in front of the public reading his instructions wrong  and being taken away for a mini-meet when a customer order was waiting  perhaps not checking what I had asked for? Maybe his hand writing on the notepad was quite illegible  who knows. RIP BBQ pizza I never had #firstworldproblems";;;;;2016-11-08T19:48:50+0000;1478634530;2016-11-08 20:48:50;2;2;2;0;4;2;2;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have just came to a very unpleasant letter issues by a debt recovery company informing me I have to pay £130 by 17/11/2016 or they will take me to court. As you can imagine this has caused me a considerable amount of stress and worry.   I have used your store in Penrith and it s car park a number of times. However this has left a very sour taste in my mouth and has left me very reluctant to stop in your stores again.   I was only in your store earlier today and noticed that those cameras which are meant to log cars coming in and leaving your car park are actually not working!! How can you enforce a parking fine if £130 for a car park which hasn t been functioning properly for at least the last 2 months?   £130 is a very steep fine to expect your customers to pay and I think it is an unnecessary stress that you are allowing people to face. I am a single full time working mum who has to work 2 jobs to make ends meet I don t have £130 spare sitting around just to pay out like that.   So as one of your customers I am asking you to act up on this and sort your car park systems out and the company s that run them. As previously mentions the cameras in your Penrith branch car park have no been working for some time so how can you enforce it for one car and not another?   I would very much appreciate it if you spoke to your car parking company and got this car park fine cancelled as it has been unfairly given due to having no other letters regards this other that this 1 I have reviewed to day. I am very upset that as a big company like yourself are letting company s like this take advantage!   I hope to here from you soon.   From a very unhappy stressed and worried customer.;;;;;2016-11-08T17:24:29+0000;1478625869;2016-11-08 18:24:29;0;5;0;0;5;5;3;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ordered my online grocery shop on Saturday 5th November to arrived between 9-10am on Monday night. I went through the 3D security and received the standard confirmation email and text regarding my order. However 10.20pm on Monday night I had still not received my shopping. I rang the customer service team and spoke to someone that was most unhelpful and said that the driver had already been past my home and they had rung. However I had not received any phone call or voicemail and they have delivered to my address previously. The customer service team member said my transaction had not gone through yet they had packed everything in the store to deliver to mine? As soon as there was any issue regarding my order I should have been contacted immediately. However if I had not have rung up late last night I doubt the store would have contacted me. The customer service member then said that it was too late for any more deliveries to come back out despite the fact they deliver in my area between 10pm-11pm so someone could have come back out with my shopping. I was informed and assured the manager of the local Taplow store would contact me first thing in the morning regarding this. However this never happened. This is very heartless from such a big chain superstore that a manager can not respond to my complaint. I now have no idea where my shopping is or how I will be getting my money back. One thing for sure is I will not be recommending anyone in future to use Sainbury s online delivery service as there customer service on this particular occasion was completely non existent.;;;;;2016-11-08T09:43:33+0000;1478598213;2016-11-08 10:43:33;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I bought a microwave about 1 year ago and the microwave started to smoke and catch fire whilst cooking something in it so I contacted my local sainsburys who asked me if I had the receipt to which I answeres I lost the receipt  I called customer careline to tell them and they told me to send my microwave oven to them so that they could run a quality test on the microwave. I received a letter saying that they would be in touch within 15 days. I heard nothing for about 4 weeks and then I called them and asked what had happened to my microwave. They told me they were waiting for an answer from their quality control. Well a couple of days past and they called me up and told me that some dried food was inside the microwave oven and this is why it caught light  they then told me that they could not give me another microwave. I asked them if I could have my microwave back because if it was only food that had caught light then of course it would still work and I would be able to get my microwave back  well they told me they would call me back that day to see if they could get me my microwave back  it has now been 1 week and still no telephone call or my microwave back.. Do not buy any sainsburys microwave oven grill because they are rubbish and only last 1 year avoid at all costs!!! Sainsburys also do not work with a resolution dispute service like the retail ombudsman service so you can t make a complaint to anyone but sainsburys!! So there is no point buying their products..

We purchased a Halloween Frankenstein fountain from CRAYFORD sainsburys on Halloween. Set it up in our back garden and lit it. Within seconds it exploded and then a small red/green flame burned for around 1 minute. Thankfully our small children were standing over 15 meters away we left the firework and went inside. Around 15 mins later we looked out the back window and the fountain was pouring out (like it should have done earlier) but on its side. The kiddies were disappointed  money was wasted but more importantly it was dangerous.;;;;;2016-11-07T22:02:13+0000;1478556133;2016-11-07 23:02:13;0;7;0;0;7;7;4;3;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

It is about how to communicate with Deaf customers and how Sainsbury’s wants to be the most inclusive and welcoming supermarket for deaf people.   On one hand this is a brilliant video – on the other – it doesn’t reflect reality as none of my local supermarkets – beit  Tesco  Sainsbury s  Asda  Morrisons  Co-operative  Aldi  Waitrose or Lidl have signing members of staff. Dot Sign are a local ‘Not for Profit’ organisation operating in the South East (around the Guildford and Woking area).  I work as a communication aide for Dot Sign. Making a video clip is brilliant – but the only way to staff that are deaf aware is to either have a deaf awareness session in the work place  send your staff on some deaf awareness/ Taster Sessions or send them to a BSL level 1 certified course.   I wish t make contact with whoever organises staff training – to ensure that some staff in the South East start learning some basic BSL. Please can you give me the contact details of the training coordinator in the South East so that I can make contact with him/her.

I used your recently enabled pay at Pump facility at the Burpham branch on Friday night.

But after visiting the restaurant with my two young daughters i was flabbergasted at the sheer lack of organisation and customer service!!! We arrived about 11.45 and with a less than half full restaurant we Queued for over 10 minutes to be served. My children had chosen a sandwich meal deal which you choose the pre made sandwich at the refrigerator. As 1 of my children will only eat a sandwich without butter I decided to pick a pre made sandwich for my youngest child then with intention to ask the staff if they could make a sandwich fresh with no butter. They lady behind the counter was less than helpful and refused point blank to make a sandwich saying   this is something we do not do!!  Feeling annoyed I decided that I would order some hot food instead  but was told that we would have an half an hour wait for hot food. Confused at this point that a restaurant which was not even half full and just before lunchtime was already delayed with hot food by half an hour shows a complete lack of organisation. My biggest complaint is that a restaurant was unable to make a ham sandwich with no butter (2 slices of bread and a piece of ham) is absolutely disgraceful!! We did buy the 1 sandwich meal with the pre made sandwich and neither of my children ate the sandwich as the lumps of butter stuck to the bread made the sandwich inedible. I feel any organisation which provides a food service  particularly children s meals should always have an healthy option and a company of Sainsburys stature should be showing their customers they are fully onboard with the issues regarding obesity concerns with the younger generation. I am Less than a happy customer.;;;;;2016-11-06T22:21:47+0000;1478470907;2016-11-06 23:21:47;1;2;1;0;3;2;2;0;5;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

My first port of call was a pair of gloves for my two oldest children. On my way to the clothing I passed a mum with her little boy; he wasn t very happy about something but I didn t bat an eyelid  I m a mum  I know what it s like. A short amount of time passes and I m in the food aisles now  I heard a child crying and shouting  people are literally stopping to stare  and it s this little lad with his mum. I don t know how old he was but I wouldn t say he was older than about 6/7  his mum had to get on the floor to comfort him  and I wanted to go over to her and tell her what an amazing job she was doing considering 1) her little boy was having a massive moment and 2) half the bloody store just stop and stare  some tutting like they ve never seen a child make any noise before. I m still pacing the aisles looking for tinned peaches  which I eventually find and pass the mum again and I just give her a friendly smile  I have been there so many times with my 5 year old who can t deal with super markets  she s got sensory issues with noises  having to sit still  having to be quiet and I ve had the meltdown in the supermarket and the whole world staring many  many times... I eventually get to the checkout and I m bagging up my items when I hear the little boy crying  he s at the checkouts now  a few rows down from me. The girl who is serving me is scanning my items when her colleague behind  who s also scanning someone s shopping  turns around and says very loudly   someone needs to sedate their child.  In absolute shock that she had even said that  I could help but react.  It s not so easy when you ve got kids.  I blurted in her direction  the girls serving me looks a little worried as I think she can also sense that it wasn t the best thing to say.. Maybe it bothered me more because the child was doing exactly what my eldest was doing  and I felt sympathy for her  not annoyance at the child. Even if you thought that the child was  in need of sedating   you wouldn t say it in front of customers. I m pretty sure she didn t have any children  I mean  if she did  she wouldn t have ever come out with a comment like that. I could have been anyone  I could have had my eldest with me  who would have also not been very happy to be there  I could be a mum with a severely autistic child who s struggling with being where they are. It s completely not professional at all and its stayed with me all evening. I wanted to go and give the mum a high five before I left and tell her how well she was still doing  she had patience like no other even by the time she got to the checkout. I know how hard it is to get round the place and keep everything together! I don t know what the girl was called on the checkout  but she was very young  blonde hair  lots of make up with dreadful eyebrows. I m not sure I want to come in the store with my children anymore  so you might have just lost yourself some custom. Today they happened to be waiting in the car with Daddy. Please educate your staff on professionalism and manners!  Share this post  I hope the mum in question sees this  take my hat off to her.";;;;;2016-11-06T20:11:31+0000;1478463091;2016-11-06 21:11:31;194;101;222;86;409;94;37;57;197;0;189;13;0;0;0;15;0

And this is the second time by your staff as well! I was using the restaurant in your Westwood cross store in Thanet Kent. Me and a friend ordered meals and where told it would take 15m due to it being busy which was not a problem  after a while a nice lady brought us the completely wrong meals so they went back  we weighted for a long time then she came back with two meals which we didn t order again  so we weighted again we where talking and didn t notice how long this was all taking we then where completely forgotten about after a hours weight we had enough and decided to go and get our money back  which was fair enough the lady handing out the meals was very apologetic  she went to get the manager who was the opposite  she said to me I had ordered some that wasn t on the menu till lunch and said that was my fault I pointed out that my friend had order a breakfast and we where brought the wrong meals twice also if it wasn t being severed why had you taken my money if I was told I would have ordered something else  no apology she had a really bad attitude!! She took my receipt which is for £6.75 and gave me £5 back? I asked about the rest and she had taken off for the coffee! I said that most of it was still in the cup on the table as it had gone cold as It was to be with my meal  she just looked blankly at me and refunded my friends money! Still no sorry for making you weight for a hour nothing she just looked really annoyed  I ask here name and said I would take it further as I have never been treated this badly and could not believe the attitude of someone that was supposed to be a manager! her name was Emma On the way out the lady serving me stop apologised bit late but at lest she did! I use your shops all the time and this hole thing makes me want to use Tesco which I don t like but on principle I think I might!;;;;;2016-11-06T17:04:40+0000;1478451880;2016-11-06 18:04:40;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I wrote to JL yesterday but they have advised that they rent spaces from Sainsburys so they are restricted in their ability to manage those spaces.

But tonight you ve let me down.  We ordered a cold pizza to cook at home.  Who ever made it up loaded it with pickled jalepeno chillies!  Not only was the pizza base soggy from the vinegar on the chillies but it was unpleasantly hot.  Return it to the store i hear you say  well there s a reason that I opted for a cold pizza and thats because i didnt gave enough time to cook.

I was therefore extremely disappointed and disheartened to see that the poppy man had been relegated to the open foyer area of the store where it was absolutely freezing cold and very windy. Historically the Legion s stand has always been in-store beyond the main doors. I contacted the store and was told that there was no room for the stand in-store as it had to make way for fireworks and a security station. I understand that health and safety is important and that theft is a scourge but I m afraid I cannot believe a better place for the Legion stand could not have been found. The Legion s volunteers are a sturdy and brave bunch and unlikely to complain but I consider they deserve better when helping the rest of us remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.;;;;;2016-11-05T12:23:50+0000;1478348630;2016-11-05 13:23:50;230;64;271;40;375;63;49;14;49;0;226;9;1;0;3;28;0

I ve been wearing the above jeans all day and I was delighted with my bargain after taking advantage of your recent 25% off offer  however things turned for the worse this evening....   Following a long conversation on my mobile with a friend  I ventured from my sofa to get myself a glass of wine from my kitchen  it was at this point I noticed my hands had turned blue! Luckily a friend was with me  and he looked concerned as he felt them and also said they were cold! Nervously I sat down and started to think something was not quite right. I shook them and rubbed them together but nothing changed the colour.... I did at the same time have a rather nasty pain in my back (which I have had for a couple of days) and I began to think this was linked!! I duly called NHS 111 for their advise. I spoke to an assistant who asked me a 1000 questions about my well being and she assured me I would now be referred to a clinical consultant  who would call back immediately. Anxiously I waited and within minutes I was now speaking with a very helpful medical professional. Again more questions were asked and I was advised to keep my hands above my head and if the colour didn t change it would be best to see my doctor in the morning!!.   My hands were not changing colour... I was worried  I hadn t eaten all day  and I d been in the same position all day doing my tax return  so my friend suggested I go to the fish and chip shop with him  maybe moving would make a difference to the clear lack of circulation... I duly followed his suggestion.  I returned home  could barely touch my fish and chips as I had lost my appetite as my fear grew as the colour hadn t changed at all.   I then called my best friends mum who was an ex nurse maybe she could re assure me! In the meantime my friend went to his van and retrieved a rather old but still functioning blood pressure reading machine. My friends mum asked a number of questions and got me to take my pulse. She then told me a similar incident happened to her daughter (my best friend) where they ended up at A and E  omg I was really getting scared now  and still my hands had not turned back to a normal colour!!!!!!   After assessing my condition once again  My friends mum did add that when she was in A and E they found out that in fact her blue hand condition was in fact the dye from her jeans.......  Yep  you guessed it!!!! I went to the bathroom washed my hands and low and behold the the lather from the soap started turning blue!!!!   Omg  I was so relieved that it was the dye from my new Sainsbury s jeggings and my life wasn t coming to an abrupt end....  I had suffered temporarily from  jegginginitious    Ha ha what a funny evening I ve had  but may I point out to you  that perhaps your dark blue skinny jeans and jeggings need to come with a health warning!!!!

I went in and between 330 and 345pm my son hit his face on the side of the trolley hard which meant it he cried and bleed  not much but as my son freaks out with blood he went mental crying and causing a scene. One of your members of staff came up to us after a few seconds asking my son if he was ok and if he would like a drink. He was very helpful and grabbed my son a bottle of drink free of charge to help him out and calm him down. This was very helpful and restored my faith in humanity. All i know is that he was called Mark and he was with a few other workers making the shelves look tidy. i would love for him to get recognized for this. It doesn t seem much or a big deal but this helped my son out as he felt so much better and so we could carry on shopping without anymore fuss and looks so thank you Mark.;;;;;2016-11-04T20:44:08+0000;1478292248;2016-11-04 21:44:08;72;25;72;3;100;25;12;13;29;0;72;0;0;0;0;0;0

After piling the boxes on my doorstep the driver mumbled that he d smashed the bottle of wine and had refunded the amount. I felt sorry for him as thought he d had a bad day. Felt less sorry as I was unpacking my shopping and having to wipe everything down as the wine had obviously spilt over everything. However  no refund has appeared so tonight I have spent over an hour on the phone to your customer services who have tried in vain to contact the Bodmin store. I also tried myself only to have the line cut off each time they answered. Eventually  after an hour on the phone to customer services they said they would refund the bottle of wine themselves. And guess what ... that meant being transferred to the refund department which meant yet another wait of 15 minutes on hold. Absolutely appalling service and I ve wasted an hour trying to sort it. I should have just written the money off but I guess that s what Sainsbury s hope for otherwise why make the refund system so flipping convoluted.

I am still to receive a call back from you  that you promised me. I went back to the store on 23 October and requested to speak to store manager  Lindsay Cole. Once again  she wasn t available  I was told by Duty Manager - Gary. He s promised to get the store manager to call me  investigate the original complaint and why customer services didn t call em back. As you can guess  no one has called me back. On top of that  while I was in store speaking to Gary  two members of staff stood behind him and listen to the whole conversation. After I ve walked away  my partner was still stood there and heard the lady called Cay say about me :  people would just do anything to get something for free  !!! I ve just called your customer service people again and it was most frustrating and infuriating experience of my life. No one could tell me why I haven t received a call back or offer any other resolution apart from contacting the store manager and asking them again to call me back. I am not prepared to wait another month to hear a reason why no one called me back in first place. I am not interested in the reason why  it is simply unacceptable  there is no valid reason for this to ever happen. I asked to be put through to a manager  a person called James who introduced himself as an Online  Manager had told me that he needs to find out why the store didn t get in touch with me and there is nothing else he can do for me. When I told him this isn t good enough and I am not prepared to deal directly with the store after I ve been treated by staff in such awful manner. James became really nervous on the phone  admitted that he doesn t usually speak to customers on the phone and when I suggested he should put me through to someone who knows how to deal with customers over the phone - he hung up! I am livid and just beyond disappointed with the level of customer service you provide. You ve wasted a lot of my time  cause me stress and upset. I would like to know: is this Sainsbury s stand on how to treat customers? Do you not tell your employees not to make derogatory comments about customers in store  especially while those customers are still ins tore shopping? Is it normal to hung up on customers who is upset because they ve been waiting for a call back for over a month and been insulted in the store? I m appalled. Speechless. I ve spent thousands of pounds in your store this year alone. I am not planning to set my foot in any of your stores ever again.;;;;;2016-11-03T11:37:43+0000;1478173063;2016-11-03 12:37:43;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I saw a campaign from you yesterday around the Fenchurch area (not sure if it was the Fenchurch St branch) whereby your team was handing out free sandwiches  as well as a voucher for the On the Go range. This was a lovely treat and I m sure everyone enjoyed their free lunch. It did strike me  however  that these free lunches were given to people generally who could buy their own  with no real explanation of the campaign  rather than the number of homeless people in the area who I m sure would have appreciated it a whole lot more. I chose to give my sandwich away to someone who really needed it  and I wondered if you would consider this in the future.

Well sainsburys think it s completely acceptable that you do.  Yet again after giving them the benefit of the doubt  they send me fresh produce in a 3pm delivery slot to be used by that day.  Their stance is its to reduce their food waste but it would seem they have no problem increasing ours  the consumer.  So basically we save them money as they offload their soon to be (questionable that it s not already) out of date stuff and basically we re out of pocket as we have to bin it.  Hmm that seems fair...  If you re a binge eater great then this is the shop for you. If like I  you do a weekly shop to last you the week then I suggest you save your money and get to a shop yourself.;;;;;2016-11-03T09:14:31+0000;1478164471;2016-11-03 10:14:31;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I usually don t have any problems with my online shopping but this time you just mucked up ROYALLY! Firstly  my shopping  due between 8 and 9pm  arrived sometime around 8:40pm  the driver said he d tried to call me on my mobile phone  I had no missed call  nor did I have any voice-mail message. Before the driver arrived I d been on the phone to customer services  who tried to contact the store from where my shopping was being delivered  they couldn t get any decent answer  and I was informed that  if my shopping didn t arrive that night  a customer services rep would call the store and call me. When my shopping arrived  there were missing items  2 x plain bagels  2 x cinnamon and raisin bagels and a bag of sugared ring doughnuts...the ONLY things I actually wanted  everything else could have been ordered from Ocado (which I subsequently did because I sent my order back!) I thought I might have heard from Sainsbury today  with a full explanation  but I have not heard a peep from you  I m absolutely disgusted!!;;;;;2016-11-02T20:30:18+0000;1478118618;2016-11-02 21:30:18;2;7;2;0;9;7;4;3;7;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was shopping in Sainsburys on my own with both girls...Daisy was riding inside the trolley and Poppy was in the seat...During our shop (lots in the trolley) Poppy started to get grizzley...so I carried her for a while and she fell asleep on my shoulder! I got to the till and the Cashier  Pam ...saw me and instantly offered assistance to unload the trolley...being a bit stubborn and proud I declined...the lady customer in front of me then offered to help and started unloading my trolley....Pam then summoned a colleague over and insisted I let her help...along with Daisy this kind lady unloaded my whole trolley...chatting to Daisy throughout. Pam then packed all my shopping into bags and loaded them back into my trolley. Those three ladies might just see what they did as part of their job or duty but it really did mean so much to me...and totally made my day.Thank you Pam/her colleague and lady customer of sainsbury s Lordshill!!!!!

An order that was supposed to be delivered yesterday was advised last minute as not coming  rearranged to this morning whereby the driver gave our shopping to a completely different address - had to retrieve it but only I called asking where he was - finally arriving at my house with a load of unadvised (and random) substitutions  missing items  no commentary from the driver who was then blocking the road (so practically dropped the bags and then bolted off again)  45mins on the phone to Customer Service to receive nothing more than a refund for those items we could immediately identify as missing but charged.

Am standing in your St Marks Wolverhampton store where I ve come to collect my eBay parcel on click and collect service. Am somewhat disturbed to find that no one knows how to do it. Someone called Sam has cleared off with the instruction book and no one has been trained in how to locate and hand over my order.  Absolutely abysmal customer service and care. I suggest Sainsbury s look into their staff training and not offer services that no one knows how to carry out. I desperately need my parcel tonight which is why I opted for the click and collect service and have been here over twenty minutes so far with no clue when this mystical Sam will appear with instructions or even if Sam has gone home.  I need my parcel Sainsbury s.  Am becoming rather annoyed.;;;;;2016-11-01T19:53:03+0000;1478029983;2016-11-01 20:53:03;1;4;1;1;6;4;3;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Whilst trying to deal with a very rude older lady behind me in the queue.  I was finishing packing away my shopping and getting ready to pay. When the lady behind me in the queue told Carol to stop talking to me and to hurry up as she needed to be at work. I then proceeded to say to the lady that Carol had a really great job and I was just finishing packing my shopping away and paying. She then told me that I was rude Young lady who wasn t there to have a gossip and that I was making her late for work. I said to the lady that if she wanted to shop quickly without talking to checkout girl then perhaps she should visit a different supermarket (Aldis)  I also reminded her that if she was supposed to be at work than perhaps you shouldn t of been shopping at that time of day. Carol throughout this was pleasant and professional.   It s normally my generation that is given the tarnish that we don t talk to people that we rushed that we don t pay attention to what s going on around us. However today this old lady disproved this theory.   Lovely customer service. 💖;;;;;2016-11-01T10:16:10+0000;1477995370;2016-11-01 11:16:10;142;38;145;7;190
