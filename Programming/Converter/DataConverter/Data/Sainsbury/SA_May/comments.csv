I've just seen an advert for another corporate monstrosity (Ikea to be precise, link below) who have told me that ""maybe the little things are really the big things"". I don't know what to believe anymore. It's as if everything that I thought I knew and understood has crumbled in front of me and vanished.  A bit like the blessed prosecco.  Pat, I would never compare horrific world events with my concerns over obtaining cheap prosecco. I don't think that I've said anything that would suggest that I equate these things, but I have yet to meet anyone who hasn't at some point got upset or disappointed with the smaller things.  Also, I'm banging on about the principle, rather than the prosecco.  I'd have quite liked the prosecco, mind you. At the price I thought I was getting it at, I wouldn't have cared if it wasn't very nice.;2016-06-01T17:30:42+0000;1

Although in a lot of circumstances you'll save more by buying a larger pack size, we do occasionally run promotions on certain items in order to help them sell. This can mean the larger pack size remains the same price while single units become cheaper due to the special offer. Can you send me a barcode for the item?

I take full responsibility for that but given that the order was for a very large shop  the person I spoke to in the customer service department wasn t at all interested in trying to help me out or find any kind of solution. That then left me with 13 people arriving for a weekend for a special family celebration and no food so I had to rush out myself to go and buy enough for that evening. It was arranged that the shop would then come on Saturday morning first thing but it was only the alcohol and the cupboard produce that arrived - there was no fresh produce. The alcohol also had all their security tags on them which meant we were unable to open any of them. Again  no help from your customer service team who told me they couldn t deliver it until 2pm - so yet again  I had to rush out to the supermarket to go and buy enough for breakfast for everyone. I tried to get hold of your online manager there on a number of occasions and it wasn t until my third message that she called me back. I was expecting to hear back from her with some sort of solution or compensation for all the extra food I had to buy but have heard nothing from her. I shop with you every week and have always had a very good experience but this really is completely unacceptable and so disappointing. During such a competitive time when I would have thought that supermarkets would be trying to keep their loyal and regular customers  this is definitely not what I would have expected.;2016-05-31T18:16:10+0000;10154877542799377_10154877581794377;pageowner;0;Sorry you had such a hassle Coralie.

Then I asked her to price check a melon which was clearly marked in price on the shelf, another man came along and then came back and said no it wasn't I stated it clearly was and once again her said 'no it isn't in a very accusing tone! I then walked away without buying anything absolutely disgusted and went to customer services, however on my way I did pick up the clearly marked price tag and showed them! At this point we asked to see a manager and a very 'scruffy' supervisor came to speak to us! He was called Kev! He then said he apologised about the melon but didn't know what he could do with his staff and would mention it, the man who had done all of this by this point was standing around me, my mum and my 15 month old child in a very nasty way and making us feel like criminals with 2 other colleagues!!

Thanks for your patience Rachel. I've spoken to the Store Manager, Gary. He has advised that, as the store has no public loos, we don't have the ability to allow customers to use the facilities. This is for safety reasons as the colleague toilets are located in areas that are off limits to customers. He's sorry for the experience you've had and advises that the council run the toilets in the car park, which unfortunately means we don't have any control over their opening times. Apologies again for the experience you had. Susanna;2016-05-30T13:31:07+0000;0

After about a year at £1  my usual Thursday delivery slot shot up to £3 overnight. I grumbled  but I m paying it because the drivers continue to arrive within my chosen hour  unfailingly cheerful  polite and helpful  and it s still a reasonable price.   I wish I could say the same for the people who pack the boxes for delivery. Standards are definitely on the decline. Last Thursday I discovered that my milk containers had been placed on their sides in the bottom of a box  and then so much had been thrown  on top  that one of the bottles had leaked milk all over the bottom of the box. Had I not needed the contents of that box I would have sent the whole thing back  but as it was  the driver kindly refunded me the items that had to have packaging completely removed  and also for the rather dented  leaky bottle of milk.   The driver was brilliant; he got some paper towel to help me dry all the items in the box so I could take them to my kitchen. They all had to be washed before I could put them away to avoid the stink of dried milk.  After the driver had gone  I found more items whose packaging had to be disposed of as it had become saturated with milk. I was too fed up to bother chasing refunds etc. and that s really not what I m after anyway. These packing errors make the drivers  jobs more difficult than they already are  and that s just not fair on them.  This isn t the first time I ve had to be refunded for damaged goods  or for rotten fruit/veg. The standard used to be great  but since more people are opting for online services  the standards in the warehouses seems to be slipping somewhat. The delivery drivers - in my area at least - remain some of the best ambassadors for Sainsbury s and you should be proud of them. I wish I could say the same for the pickers/packers; it s as if they simply don t care.";2016-05-30T07:27:38+0000;10154873551619377_10154874631749377;68d816995d4b1242cc7fc4f87d98b9a917051f6c;1;I'm not after freebies or vouchers, so I shan't bother to PM, since that's probably what you'll do. The price for the Thursday 10-11am slot did indeed increase from from £1 to £3 about 2 weeks ago, and has stayed the same since. it was described as a 'fluctuation', but forgive my scepticism on that!  I just wanted to offer some feedback on areas I think the service needs improvement, and areas I think it's great, in the hope you could take something from it.  If the staff who pick and pack the boxes are slipping up maybe there's a problem in the team? If staff are doing a crap job, it's usually because they see no reason to take pride in their work. From professional experience I know that's usually a management issue. One of the greatest motivators to work is being made to feel appreciated. Maybe they aren't feeling it? They don't get the first hand experience with customers that the drivers do, so they'll never get the thanks, and the praise unless their managers offer it. As a manager I learned to deal with good performance in exactly the same way as I dealt with poor performance. I made sure eac individual was made aware of something they'd done well, and what was good about it. it actually goes further than a tiny pay rise, and costs nothing!;2016-05-30T15:40:25+0000;0

I'm really sorry that this delivery hasn't been up to scratch compared to our usual high standards you're used to. I've checked into this and it seems the delivery slots haven't changed price, however they do vary depending on demand and availability so it may have been that your slot has been busier than usual for this delivery, resulting in a higher cost. Can you send me your order number and the account holders name in a PM please? I'll see what we can do to help! Ryan.;2016-05-30T11:10:26+0000;0

I pointed out that you are again and illegally fly posting in Central Milton Keynes. His attitude was one of nonchalance and verging on the surly. He reminded me of my son when he was a errant 14 year old.

She was hungry and I needed to feed her (I am breastfeeding) so went into the baby change room to do this expecting there to be somewhere to sit so I could feed my baby. I was disappointed to see that there was nowhere to sit to feed  the room was incredibly small and I only just had space to take my pram in the room with me and in the end had to feed my baby standing up. I just wanted to express my disappointment and share my experience which wasn t good as a breastfeeding mother and will be a factor in deciding if I visit this store again in the near future. Thank you.;2016-05-27T20:30:08+0000;10154867251299377_10154868472804377;pageowner;0;Sorry about that. We provide these changing rooms to help our customers and I'm sorry they we've disappointed you.

I guess if it s not a known fault  it s just proverbial tough s**t then.....meanwhile I have no TV of course......not exactly the good service I would have expected.;2016-05-27T13:20:09+0000;10154866255764377_10154866534239377;8c72cf53d98e0dad9c5673480dd1b4705c8334c2;0;Sounds like they're following what's set out in the Consumer Rights Act 2015. 😢;2016-05-27T15:26:30+0000;0

I am writing now to ask that Sainsbury’s take responsibility for the sustainability of all tuna tins on your shelves - not just your own brand.  Why is Sainsbury’s selling John West tuna?  You know that John West have broken their commitment to clean up their supply chain. Despite this  you continue to stock their unsustainable tuna  caught using large nets associated with Fish Aggregating Devices  a method that causes indiscriminate harm to marine life  and notably to endangered species such as sharks and turtles.  Sainsbury’s has been helping lead the way toward a sustainable tuna market in the UK. But in the last 2 weeks  Tesco and Waitrose said they could drop John West if they don’t reach high sustainability standards and renounce this destructive fishing method. I would expect nothing less from Sainsbury’s.  I sincerely hope you will take action to ensure Sainsbury’s is selling 100% sustainable tuna.;2016-05-27T12:59:36+0000;10154866220654377_10154866546229377;8c72cf53d98e0dad9c5673480dd1b4705c8334c2;0;Customers should stop buying JW tuna and retailers will naturally stop stocking it.;2016-05-27T15:34:42+0000;1

Having a small (or not so small) baby is hard work breastfeeding or not, and from my experience with my 2 boys a smile or small gesture of kindness makes a huge difference......... I am sooooo happy I helped you Kate. Your little one is a lucky boy. But I think the biggest praise should be to Kate for having the courage to do what she needed and when she needed for her baby.

The sponge had a beautiful  soft  course open texture texture- exactly like  a perfect home made cake. Filled with a beautiful balance of tangy  zesty lemon  complimenting the gentle  smooth  rich texture of fresh cream. FINUALLY a cake that doesn t disappoint.... but much  much more  a  DEVINE cake that delivers on every level. The one down side??... cannot find it online....terrified that it is a  one off  and can never taste again....Sainsbury s please reassure????  Feel duty bound to inform true cake lovers of this perfect addition but also wary...I will have to send out a  posse  if I cannot buy again  due to over demand.;2016-05-27T00:29:14+0000;10154864966969377_10154865929839377;pageowner;0;Hi Julie, glad you enjoyed it!

I hope you have a lovely weekend! Ryan.;2016-05-27T07:41:26+0000;0

I always was of the belief that the extra space was to make it easier to strap your child in as the door opens wider or space so the door opens wide enough to get a baby seat in and out. Turns out I m mistaken! Not happy  the child in question was 10 years old so needed no extra help in or out. NOT HAPPY AT THIS SITUATION AT ALL!  Also wondering why st-annes branch is supporting a food bank that will not help ANYONE in our area! We surprisingly and unfortunately have a foodbank in st-annes but for some reason they have chosen to support Blackpool foodbank despite of this. Blackpool foodbank WILL NOT help st-annes residents as it is a separate area to us even though it is only 3 miles to the border! They will only support Blackpool residents. Seems bizarre to me when we can support the local one.;2016-05-26T16:24:43+0000;10154864017374377_10154864454684377;335d8b2438a3aa474c29890df2b4f5bebfd99954;0;I seriously thought this was a way to bring up issues with sainsburys but obviously I'm mistaken and it's actually for trolls to attack people.

After registering  which took forever (through no fault of my own and re entering a password several times) it finally let me proceed to pick my groceries.  After around 40 minutes I finally had everything in my basket ready to check out. I got to delivery and billing info which was again a complete farce  after entering all relevant info several times over only to be keep being timed out. Much to my fustration.  Not one to be defeated I turned on my laptop to finalise my order and pay and now when i try to log in on the laptop I am also being timed out constantly.  Please sort your website out as I would really like my order.  Kind Regards  Lorna Harrison;2016-05-26T11:44:53+0000;10154863486989377_10154863573089377;pageowner;0;Hi Lorna.

I am against testing on animals and find it increasingly hard to find/locate products that are not tested on animals. What would be REALLY helpful would be if you could have a section of the cruelty free products you sell so that people like myself can go straight there instead of having to search around between all the other products to find the humane ones. Do you think there would be a possibility of this happening? I think think it would be welcomed with open arms by a lot of your customers.  Many thanks;2016-05-26T11:17:55+0000;10154863438404377_10154863596934377;bb46e91edc91b905ffe0699f2c3f6425020f9477;1;Thanks Megan, much appreciated. It would make it a lot easier to be able to go to a section and grab any product knowing it hadn't been tested on animals rather than having to trawl through all the shampoos, face washes, etc to find a brand that doesn't test on animals or to check all the labels. I have to say when I went to the Tunbridge Wells store the other day I couldn't find any shampoos/conditioners that hadn't been tested on animals.  Cheers!;2016-05-26T12:49:47+0000;0

Also they stock Method and Ecover laundry and cleaning products which also have the leaping bunny logo on them too.

Unfortunately you have failed on your freshness promise  the one thing that usually sets you apart from your competitors. The main bulk of my fresh groceries either expired the same day of the delivery or 1-2 days later! As much as my daughter loves carrot sticks and grapes she is only 3 & cannot eat the lot in 1 day! The carrot sticks were slimey  as were the egg noodles that went off on the day of purchase. None of the short dated produce was delivered in a blue bag to alert me and allow me the chance to send it back (which has been common practice in all of my previous deliveries.) It is only now  2 days later  that I have been forced to investigate the dates of all of the products having opened browning grapes this morning that turn out to have expired yesterday.   Most of my fresh meat and fish also have shorts dates. Forcing me to cook a dinner tonight consisting of salmon  prawns & chicken plus alot of wilting salad and vegetables  in order to not waste any of the food. This should have been 3 dinners for my family. I cannot afford to replace meals based on the incompetence of such a large  usually excellent  supermarket chain.   To top it all off the bread and fruit loaf were delivered squashed. Anyone with a 3 year old will understand that misshapen bread will not do for a sandwich (unless it s in the shape of a gingerbread man so the head can be bitten off!) It s difficult enough to satisfy the ever changing appetite of a toddler without slimey carrot sticks  gone off grapes and plates full of meat and fish.   On a positive note the delivery driver was extremely polite and friendly. Just a shame the vegetables weren t the same.  Yours sincerely  A very dissapointed customer.;2016-05-26T08:46:28+0000;10154863189514377_10154863298769377;pageowner;0;Very sorry you had such a bad experience Alicia!

I also want to add that when I shop in store in Maidstone (town center  Aylesford and the small shop in Loose) I have been satisfied by politeness and helpfulness of staff and the products I have bought. I do sometimes visit your superstore in Ashford and have yet again been happy with my shopping experience. I just thought I would pop a good review here and say thanks cos many people (including myself at times) tend to use social media as a way to vent their issues with a company so I just wanted to try and even things out with a nice review. Please pass on this on to the relevant people at the Maidstone stores and delivery team. Thanks 😊☺;2016-05-25T14:09:14+0000;10154861095619377_10154861121249377;pageowner;0;Thanks for the kind words Charlotte, great to have you on board!

We didn't accept that? You should offer a refund. The point is that it's put me off using sainsburys. A voucher means I have to return there. It's also a shame I've had to keep chasing you up, and further on social media, totalling 5 times!   I am pleased you have finally replied however.

It is nice to finally be heard and have the situation put right. The nectar card offer is out of the question, I find that the points equate to very little so if you cannot offer a refund (which I think is a little unfair, but you do have your procedures),  then I would like to accept the vouchers and I can use them to get some new towels or something for the house which will put a smile on my face that you have rectified the inconveniences caused to us.   It's important that the store does learn of this feed back so that they can tighten their click and collect service to make it more in line with expectations. I'm really pleased you've done this, so again, thank you for seeing to my complaint and finally allowing me to be heard. Annie.;2016-05-25T15:40:48+0000;0

And I have to be honest  Sainsbury s have been fantastic.  I spoke to Michael (Duty Manager) & Marie (Customer Service Manager) and they said if i arrive at store just after they open (7am) i can ask a member of staff to go pick up a few bits for me while i wait outside with the dog. While that was fine  i was happy. it s improved.  There is a really nice women called Jill who will not only come outside the store  but hold s Bella while i go in  pick up a few bits of shopping  and another member of staff around the till area (Andy mainly) will just jump on a till so i don t need to mess about with self-scan too.  So if Jill is not working  i will just ask a member of staff to go get me a few bits  but if Jill is working  she will come hold Bella while I go in. I can t even try and explain how awesome she is.

I ve been trying to  Taste the Difference  but frankly all I can taste is sweetness. The ingredients list Madeira wine (3%)  sugar and caramalised sugar. I may be confused about this but I was under the impression that chicken liver parfait is not generally consumed as a desert and so does not need to be sweet. Come to think of it  I m not sure it needs pork fat as the second ingredient on the list either but that s a different story. If I m wrong  and you do intend this as a desert (its definitely sweet enough) could you please advise what you would pair it with. A dollop of squirty cream perhaps? Chocolate sauce?;2016-05-24T18:39:04+0000;10154859110734377_10154859399324377;8629d1d84dbd88b728729870149e741e1ef3f67f;1;Thanks for the reply. I don't like sugar in foods that don't need it or shouldn't have it. I don't want to have to read the ingredients of every single item I buy and if an item comes under your apparently superior and definitely more expensive range then it should be composed of high quality, appropriate ingredients. I am sure that you are more than able to identify the barcode at your end.;2016-05-24T21:02:34+0000;0

I ve been trying to  Taste the Difference  but frankly all I can taste is sweetness. The ingredients list Madeira wine (3%)  sugar and caramalised sugar. I may be confused about this but I was under the impression that chicken liver parfait is not generally consumed as a desert and so does not need to be sweet. Come to think of it  I m not sure it needs pork fat as the second ingredient on the list either but that s a different story. If I m wrong  and you do intend this as a desert (its definitely sweet enough) could you please advise what you would pair it with. A dollop of squirty cream perhaps?

Fortuitously, I kept a copy in draft which I set out below.  SENT ON THURSDAY 14 APRIL 2016 I have had a number of issues with the Pharmacy at your Tunbridge Wells store in the past and have complained previously (Feb 2014) but yesterday beggared belief. I apologise for the lengthy email but to say I am livid is an understatement.  I order my repeat prescriptions on line and they are delivered to the pharmacy.  I called on Tuesday to check that they had picked these up, there are several on a regular basis, they did not have them.  Someone took my number and said they would call me back.  They did not.  I called again on Wednesday and was told they did not have them.  I had been to my doctor's surgery in the morning and the nurse had confirmed they had all been signed for.  In addition to my repeat prescription I had ordered a supply of insulin which I had recently been prescribed and which was not yet on repeat.  The nurse confirmed this too had been put through the system.  To double check I call your pharmacy at 17.18 to ensure they had received all my prescriptions.  I was about to travel and needed the insulin.  Again I was told they had not received any prescriptions.  I called the surgery who confirmed that the prescriptions had been signed for by a member of the pharmacy team.  I called the pharmacy again who then confirmed they had the prescriptions but they were not ready yet.  I work in the City and said that was fine I would collect on my way home at about 7 pm.  I double-checked about the insulin and was advised this was fine.  I did not therefore ask my surgery to fax through that prescription.  Sainsbury’s is about a 15 minute walk for me from the train station.  I also suffer from COPD and arthritis so my walking is not particularly speedy.  I arrived at the pharmacy at about 7.10 pm.  The first issue is that although my bulk repeat was ready I had to remind the assistant, yet again, that there were additional items in the fridge.  I have to do this on a regular basis.  I do not think it is correct that I know more than your assistants about how to run the practice and check that everything is there.  We then got onto the subject of the insulin.  The pharmacist was adamant it had not been signed for.  He said there was nothing he could do and I would need to call 111.  He was most unhelpful and by this stage I was truly angry.  I am a Legal Executive and if I treated my clients in the way I was treated I would be sued for negligence and work would be placed elsewhere.  I had to leave the store to call 111 as there is no signal in the store.  I arranged for an out of hours doctor to call me and was advised it could take up to two hours.  I had no alternative but to walk home which is all uphill knowing I would have to return in a couple of hours.  I had a lot to do yesterday evening to get ready for my trip.  This delay set me back considerably.   It gets worse.  111 called me very quickly and we arranged for the prescription to be faxed to your pharmacy.  I then tried to call the store 4 times when it rang and rang and then went to fax.  The fifth time I got through but was then cut off.  On the sixth attempt I finally got through to the pharmacy and was advised that unfortunately they did not have the insulin there.  Why on earth they could not have told me that when I was in the store I cannot comprehend.  I then had to drive from Tunbridge Wells to Tonbridge to a pharmacy at East Street to collect my prescription.  I eventually got home, having not eaten (not the best option for a diabetic), not packed, not sorted and so livid it took me a good hour to calm my stress levels down to actually start prepping for the trip.  This is simply unacceptable service on even the most basic of levels.  Not only did I lose time at work trying to sort the issue out so I would not have a problem, I then lost further time dealing with staff that was uninformed or unhelpful.  Then, to compound that, I had to drive 10 miles there and 10 miles back to collect my prescription.  Needless to say I WILL NOT EVER be using the pharmacy service at your Tunbridge Wells store again.  In fact, on an entirely separate note I will endeavour not to frequent your store at all.  On the last 3/4 occasions when I have attended to do my weekly shop there is a marked lack of any fresh fruit available.  I usually shop on a Saturday morning when I would expect the shelves to be filled.  The standard of fruit and veg which I always thought was very good has deteriorated to a marked degree.  I await your comments. I await hearing from you by return.  I may be contacted on my personal email address.  I believe you have my work email but I would prefer this exchange to be kept entirely separate.;2016-05-25T13:35:37+0000;0

We give the option for the customer to ‘warm’ the meal in the microwave for a short time should they want to however the product is perfectly safe and acceptable to eat without doing this. The product has been heat processed at the manufacturers to a level that would remove all harmful bacteria. This has been done to an independently verified method meeting all legal and safety requirements. In addition, we regularly assess the microbiological quality of our products and have not identified any issues. Hope this helps, Danny.;2016-05-24T11:21:42+0000;1

Not even need to make but I am w very nice person and have always treated every shop assistant all my life with friendliness because this is how I like being treated) she started mouthing off to her next 2 customers about me.

She has reported it in store and you know which store, which day, and which person is the guilty party. You're embarrassing yourselves and making the situation worse by having 4 different staff members on here (Stephen, Allie, Sussana, Neil and Kirsty!!!???) all expecting more names to be provided. You don't need Ingrid's information. Her name is not that unique and she's told you she is an online subscriber.

Maybe you should impress upon Gallagher Bassett (as they are employed to be the representatives of your brand) and get them to rectify the situation.

Perhaps if I help by posting up some photos of the damage, and of your van and company logo it might help Sainsbury's to take some responsibility to help to resolve the situation? I could maybe ask the local press to help too?  They are options I don't really wan't to take but I am fed up of being ignored and passed from pillar to post.  Has Sainsbury's  made any attempt to contact Gallagher to ask them the current situation? Have you given them a nudge to try and move things along a bit?  Rather than ""Procedures need to be followed"". Procedures have been followed and it has fallen into to a black hole of ""It's not out fault it's the fault of....."" Choose an option of one of many excuses: i.e.  a) another parties fault, b) the contractors, c) the man that measured it, d) the delivery of materials etc. etc. etc.   Your driver admitted it was his fault at the time and Gallagher have admitted liability.  Do you not think a better answer would be ""We have listened to your complaint and we will work with Gallagher to resolve the situation as quickly possible and have spoken to PERSON X. I will get a senior Sainsbury's manager to contact you directly to help find a resolution. Sorry this has caused you so much inconvenience and distress. Is there anything else we can do to help at the moment?"".

They are damaging Sainsbury's brand and reputation.  All I am trying to do it get Sainsbury's to also contact Gallagher to get them to resolve the situation. Surely this is why Sainsbury's pay them?  Being told ""we can not intervene"" is not acceptable. They are agents of your company.

There was only one waiter so they were obviously under staffed so it s clear to see that they were rushed off there feet tying to complete orders but obviously not cooking the food properly . When my food came out the sausages looked burnt but stupidly I still ate them (the worst choice I made by far) as they gave me food poisoning to the point were I was being violently sick with diarrhea and shaking    food poisoning was confirmed by the doctor as your food was the only thing I ate that day that would have given me food poisoning . I am so disgusted with the poor quality of food and at the time I waited for my food that 13 hours later made me so ill I and my family will never eat at your restaurant again and this has unfortunately put me off fry ups for life. So thanks very much sainsburys I hope no one else gets as ill as I did from your poor quality of cooking.;2016-05-23T08:01:56+0000;10154854786194377_10154854810114377;ac00e9bc365b1d85e492a7831f48ef539991c755;0;Hi this is Michaels partner we was in the store and ordered at 10.46 am yesterday.

Due to the fact many people are getting sacked or disciplinary for speaking out. As the manager we have is a dictator.  Due to the management not being able to manage well and not being able to keep an eye on their staff they have come to a conclusion of totally banning hot drinks and water and food on a shop floor as they think maybe its stolen  yet some colleagues are told they are allowed bottles of water where as others are told to bring sports bottles. Also not allowed to have other company brands of water etc.  It s one rule for one department and another for other departments. People of the tills are allowed bottles. Online shoppers come down with hot drinks. People working in the night with ACs on working in the cold or just need a drink to keep them awake are not allowed. Working all night to deliver a shop that will benefit the sales of the store. Yet we are the ones that are limited and been made to feel as we are prisoners.   Breaks are taken in two groups so people are rushing to use the microwaves causing delays in warming ones food and rushing the food. If someone goes 2 minutes over they get warning letters. We don’t even have time for desserts or a tea after eating.  There have been occasions where managers from other departments have told off colleagues in such a rude manor in front of customers about hot drinks.  I have been working here over 10 years and these problems have started to occur ever since Jonathan Cooke and Jibran Khan got moved to Low Hall.  In the rush of changing things they have forgotten that we are the ones who are the most important part of running the store in terms of stocking shelves and making sure all the products are on the shelf for customers  instead of working with us we are made to feel like slaves being. Mr Khan is a very very rude arrogant man he is also a pervert. He intimidates people and if you speak back you get suspended. He does not listen and interrupts you when you want to speak and starts getting defensive. We should not be made to feel intimidated or bullied or pressurized at work when we work as hardest as we can to deliver the best.   Every year since he started people are unable to get Christmas  Eid or Diwali off. He picks and chooses who he wants to give it too.  Managers never help out if there is a shortage of staff yet they harass us to work like donkeys. Many people have claimed that Mr Khan said he gets paid to do nothing.  There have been occasions where Mr Cooke has made sarcastic comments about work being done slow or messy we take pride in our work but it s a disappointment when there is no faith in us.  Majority off the staff feels like this and want something being done. Preferably a transfer of manager or them to be demoted so the status doesn’t make them into hitler.   They yearly feed back is never anonymous as they sit there watching us what we write. The staff turnover is increasing for a reason.;2016-05-21T17:24:24+0000;10154850316119377_10154850328014377;82ef7fa29b101940aa65e3a66be4acb779285a35;0;When's your disciplinary hearing?;2016-05-21T17:30:03+0000;4

In the rush of changing things they have forgotten that we are the ones who are the most important part of running the store in terms of stocking shelves and making sure all the products are on the shelf for customers  instead of working with us we are made to feel like slaves being. Mr Khan is a very very rude arrogant man he is also a pervert. He intimidates people and if you speak back you get suspended. He does not listen and interrupts you when you want to speak and starts getting defensive. We should not be made to feel intimidated or bullied or pressurized at work when we work as hardest as we can to deliver the best.   Every year since he started people are unable to get Christmas  Eid or Diwali off. He picks and chooses who he wants to give it too.  Managers never help out if there is a shortage of staff yet they harass us to work like donkeys. Many people have claimed that Mr Khan said he gets paid to do nothing.  There have been occasions where Mr Cooke has made sarcastic comments about work being done slow or messy we take pride in our work but it s a disappointment when there is no faith in us.  Majority off the staff feels like this and want something being done. Preferably a transfer of manager or them to be demoted so the status doesn’t make them into hitler.   They yearly feed back is never anonymous as they sit there watching us what we write.

You were all over some friends posts on Morrisons regarding their selling of supposed line caught Bass that was under the MLS, and where exactly did you express an opinion this time round? You fit the profile of a troll whether you can see it yourself or not. People put questions on here for Sainsbury's not for you.   Quite clearly, the prominent printing of ""Packed in the UK"" is both factually incorrect and a deliberate attempt to mislead the consumer. You've failed to actually express any reasoning for this - because you won't be in possession of the facts (see why the question should be answered by Sainsburys?)

My husband went out to ask him not to try to turn his lorry because he hits the pots & he outright denied it :O my husband told him I d taken photographs & he turned round & said  you can t do anything about it unless you have a photograph of my face! :O what kind of attitude is that?

I cant say that I think very much of a super market that does not remove John West tuna tins knowing that the sale of these is not a sustainable practice!

Christmas! yeayee"" seriously, perhaps you want to have an argument that is not intellectually insulting?unless you are that naive?!; I am not saying the producer hasn't got a responsibility but guess what, Sainsbury's are paying! they place the order! the producer want the money cause they want to stay in business. The supplier supplies what the order is. IF sainsbury's says recyclable then it will be so - i would expect there is a higher cost to this and it is Sainsbury's to accept to pay more. in this instance the big guy can use it clout to force a change - and hopefully not negatively to the margins of the small producer. and its 'you're' not 'your' , but then again perhaps I should talk to your teacher for teaching you poor spelling and not you?";2016-05-20T19:06:35+0000;1

It would off course be more efficient that you as a business, which I am sure have a list of what every product you commission and put on your shelves is comprised off, can simply look up the material these products are packaged in and discuss with all your suppliers. I would encourage you to start with your salads and pasta. I would expect you are eating your own products and are thereafter throwing the packaging away and given your interest in recyclability it would not be unreasonable to think that you also notice this. List of barcodes to follow. thanks again;2016-05-20T19:07:13+0000;1

So I dropped into your Redditch store this evening  having recently converted to Sainsbury s because in our town your fruit and veg selection is of a higher quality than your competitors. I was pleased to grab some Strawberries that had come from Staffordshire.  But then I got to the asparagus.  I was really looking forward to getting hold of some big thick asparagus spears at a good price because of them being in season and being grown only 20 miles south of your store in Evesham.  The BBC website says:  More asparagus is grown in Worcestershire than anywhere else in the UK  and the asparagus from the Vale of Evesham has been considered the best in the world for many years.   But instead I was greeted with a packet of thin-looking spears that had come all the way from Peru. I ve been on Google Maps  Sainsbury s  and it tells me that s around 6 026 miles away from the Redditch store - and that s as the crow flies. Let s not get into the financial and environmental cost of transporting the goods.   How can it be that you can get Strawberries from Staffordshire to your Redditch store when that county is some 60 miles away on the other side of Birmingham  and yet you can t get asparagus into the store when it s only 20 miles south?;2016-05-19T20:37:45+0000;10154845435564377_10154846558144377;pageowner;0;Hi there Mike, the UK weather in March and April was unusually cold. This delayed the UK crop. We have in the past been 100% British as early as April 15th, and as late as May 23rd. We have been selling indoor grown British asparagus since March, but the weather is the driver for when we can get our outdoor crops, and so this year it's late. Debs;2016-05-20T06:55:15+0000;1

This evening I picked up some Sainsburys salmon from the shelf  rather than the fish counter and looking at the shelf thought that it was £2.50.  This seemed like a good deal and this influenced my choice of product.  However  at the till this actually rang up as £5.00.  The explanation was that it was two portions of fish each at £2.50.  This seems reasonable  but in that case why is it priced on the shelf at £2.50!  All of the packages seemed to contain 2 pieces of fish.  Technically I am sure that it makes it clear on the shelf that it is per portion and on the packaging itself it says £2.50 on one side and then £5 on the other  but this is misleading and with all the controversy around packaging changes and alterations to weights I feel that it might well be intentional.  You might say this is only £2.50 and it won t break the bank  but none-the-less  I am cross about this.  Please do something about this Sainsburys  you can do better than this.

However  to my horror I have recently learned that 33 businesses in the UK and Wales ( a fifth of all those with CCTV) have refused to share the information provided with the FSA. It is not publicly known which slaughterhouses have refused to share such footage  In my view this is totally unacceptable behaviour. As you are probably aware efforts are now being made for CCTV to be made mandatory in all slaughterhouses and legislation passed to ensure that footage is available to official vets.

I am compelled to write as I wish to complain about my visit to the Sainsbury’s Heaton  Newcastle Superstore earlier this morning. First let me take you back to the sunny evening of the 6th May. I called in to the petrol station to fill up  went to pay the £46.19 with my debit card but unfortunately there seemed to be a problem as the card terminal was saying ‘Timed Out’  we tried a few more times and then on a different till but to no avail. The gentleman apologised profusely and explained that his colleague was on the phone to IT. I had to then go back over to the main store and withdraw cash in order to pay for my fuel. A bit of a pain in the ass but needs must and these things happen.  I now bring you back to current day  I noticed that my account was rather depleted with no reasonable explanation as to why. I logged on to online banking and noticed that the fuel payments which we had attempted back on the 6th had come out…..not once…not twice…..not three times…..but FIVE times! So thats £230.95 on fuel in 5 separate transactions!  So I head down to customer services armed with my bank statement hoping this would be resolved quickly and we could all then get on with our lives.  My first contact is with a lady who listened to my story and looked at my bank statement  no apology. She shouted over to her colleague who came over and I told him the sorry tale. No apology  I was told he would have to speak to his manager. He came back but again no apology or explanation as to what was going on and just barked “bank card” at me and then had the ordacity to pull a face! He made me feel as though this was my fault and I’ve never felt so uncomfortable. He then stated that as ‘Good Will’ they will give me back £184.76  Good Will?? Is he moonlighting as Robin Hood or something?  You took £230.95 which was not yours and you are giving me SOME of my own money back as ‘Good Will’? He then said that I couldn’t prove that I paid for the petrol with the £50 cash I withdrew so I wasn’t going to get the last £46.19.  I certainly didn’t rock up at the petrol station with an additional 4 jerry cans and fill them up to exactly £46.19 each because I was paranoid that if we did leave the EU and World War 3 started  it would cause some sort of oil crisis in the Middle East.  Surely some sort of investigation needs to be carried out as I was not the only person who had ‘failed’ card transactions that day and had to go to the cashpoint. Surely the tills couldn’t be closed off due to a mismatch?  I am grateful that I have £184.76 back  although it still hasn’t arrived in my account. I do wish to have this investigated as I believe that all of this can be proved and that you will refund me the last £46.19.;2016-05-19T14:44:12+0000;10154844615289377_10154844674279377;pageowner;0;Hi Anna, I'm really sorry about this.

Be aware they WILL automatically delete the CCTV images after (I don't know), 24-48-72-however-many hours. I would suggest the store save this footage. If they do *not* save the footage, this suggests they have something to hide. The till register system should also have its own receipts built in, I'm sure every transaction is logged electronically on your side - whether paid in cash or by card. So I'm sure you must be able to track a 46.19 GBP cash transaction being made at the specified time. (Anna, can you specify the exact time, as precisely as possible?

I am compelled to write as I wish to complain about my visit to the Sainsbury’s Heaton  Newcastle Superstore earlier this morning. First let me take you back to the sunny evening of the 6th May. I called in to the petrol station to fill up  went to pay the £46.19 with my debit card but unfortunately there seemed to be a problem as the card terminal was saying ‘Timed Out’  we tried a few more times and then on a different till but to no avail. The gentleman apologised profusely and explained that his colleague was on the phone to IT. I had to then go back over to the main store and withdraw cash in order to pay for my fuel. A bit of a pain in the ass but needs must and these things happen.  I now bring you back to current day  I noticed that my account was rather depleted with no reasonable explanation as to why. I logged on to online banking and noticed that the fuel payments which we had attempted back on the 6th had come out…..not once…not twice…..not three times…..but FIVE times! So thats £230.95 on fuel in 5 separate transactions!  So I head down to customer services armed with my bank statement hoping this would be resolved quickly and we could all then get on with our lives.  My first contact is with a lady who listened to my story and looked at my bank statement  no apology. She shouted over to her colleague who came over and I told him the sorry tale. No apology  I was told he would have to speak to his manager. He came back but again no apology or explanation as to what was going on and just barked “bank card” at me and then had the ordacity to pull a face!

My first contact is with a lady who listened to my story and looked at my bank statement  no apology. She shouted over to her colleague who came over and I told him the sorry tale. No apology  I was told he would have to speak to his manager. He came back but again no apology or explanation as to what was going on and just barked “bank card” at me and then had the ordacity to pull a face! He made me feel as though this was my fault and I’ve never felt so uncomfortable. He then stated that as ‘Good Will’ they will give me back £184.76  Good Will?? Is he moonlighting as Robin Hood or something?  You took £230.95 which was not yours and you are giving me SOME of my own money back as ‘Good Will’? He then said that I couldn’t prove that I paid for the petrol with the £50 cash I withdrew so I wasn’t going to get the last £46.19.  I certainly didn’t rock up at the petrol station with an additional 4 jerry cans and fill them up to exactly £46.19 each because I was paranoid that if we did leave the EU and World War 3 started  it would cause some sort of oil crisis in the Middle East.  Surely some sort of investigation needs to be carried out as I was not the only person who had ‘failed’ card transactions that day and had to go to the cashpoint. Surely the tills couldn’t be closed off due to a mismatch?  I am grateful that I have £184.76 back  although it still hasn’t arrived in my account.

I called in to the petrol station to fill up  went to pay the £46.19 with my debit card but unfortunately there seemed to be a problem as the card terminal was saying ‘Timed Out’  we tried a few more times and then on a different till but to no avail. The gentleman apologised profusely and explained that his colleague was on the phone to IT. I had to then go back over to the main store and withdraw cash in order to pay for my fuel. A bit of a pain in the ass but needs must and these things happen.  I now bring you back to current day  I noticed that my account was rather depleted with no reasonable explanation as to why.

I had coupons from Caring Everyday- partners with Johnson and Johnson  John West and Pringles through their official Facebook page and your staff were rude and accusing. They were obviously poorly trained as I had to ask the girl on the till to scan them as she didn t know what she was doing- and of course they were expected by your tills. My grandmother was asked to go to customer services where she was asked where she got the coupons and when I explained it was through the manufacturers I was made to feel a fraud  embarrassed and a liar with more clueless staff being called over to add to the confusion over something very simple. WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I ve been shopping there for around ten years but I will not be shopping at your stores again  disgraceful behaviour leaving my elderly grandmother very upset. You need to urgently deal with your rude staff. I hope no one else has to experience dirty looks from judgy sainsburies staff like we had to.;2016-05-19T13:31:23+0000;10154844463249377_10154844495349377;pageowner;0;Oh dear, not what we like to hear.

I then continued to do my shopping, bought my Son a light sabre in it and then got to the till.  I told the lady that I'd forgotten my nectar card and handed her the coupons and she said I can't do that, I told her what customer services had stated and she said no you can't, but I'll check for you.  Bearing in mind this was for £12 off and also triple nectar points (so not something to be sniffed at), her supervisor said the same and I said I'd asked before shopping and she said well if the person hadn't seen the coupons then she wouldn't know (surely that was her job to ask to see them and not pressume).  My Son started crying so I felt obliged to pay the bill and then the customer behind me who had heard everything said don't pay.  She said they can put it away for you whereby you can go and get your card and then come back and pay for it, I said really, she said yes, they don't bother telling you that (bad a customer was more helpful than the staff).  This is exactly what I did and had my Son who's 5 sobbing in the car the whole way home and back again (30 mins).  Perhaps some staff training wouldn't go amiss and also teach them to be helpful like the customer was.  I would have returned home for the card had I been told and the upset wouldn't have happened.  Also, whilst having a down moment with your store, it was so sad to see that you weren't taking part in Coeliac awareness week.  Tesco had 3 for 2 on.  A present there's not a lot to encourage me to shop in your store anymore :(.;2016-05-19T14:40:26+0000;0

I have had several TU items delivered to my local store (Bexhill  East Sussex) over the past few months  and its never been a pleasant experience when I collect/return. There are very few customer service staff who actually know what to do when I say I m collecting an order  so I nearly always have to wait for someone to come. It then takes an age for them to fiddle on the computer finding my order (because they re not really sure what they re doing)  and then I have to wait for forever while they go upstairs to fetch it. Its a very similar experience when returning an order. I usually have to allow 15mins for this process. The staff  while polite  are be no means friendly. I usually feel that I m causing a great inconvenience to them by having my order delivered to store and as such never feel welcome.   This mornings experience is what has compelled me to write something. I was returning an item of clothing - never worn  in original packing and with the paper order slip. The woman on the desk almost wouldn t accept it because I didn t have the blue outer packaging  which is essentially  just the carrier bag. I had to argue my case and she would only process the return with supervisor approval. Ok  I got my refund  but not without a fight.   I have to say  none of this makes me want to really order from you any more  and I won t pay postage to have it delivered to my house.

I have had several TU items delivered to my local store (Bexhill  East Sussex) over the past few months  and its never been a pleasant experience when I collect/return. There are very few customer service staff who actually know what to do when I say I m collecting an order  so I nearly always have to wait for someone to come. It then takes an age for them to fiddle on the computer finding my order (because they re not really sure what they re doing)  and then I have to wait for forever while they go upstairs to fetch it. Its a very similar experience when returning an order. I usually have to allow 15mins for this process. The staff  while polite  are be no means friendly. I usually feel that I m causing a great inconvenience to them by having my order delivered to store and as such never feel welcome.   This mornings experience is what has compelled me to write something. I was returning an item of clothing - never worn  in original packing and with the paper order slip. The woman on the desk almost wouldn t accept it because I didn t have the blue outer packaging  which is essentially  just the carrier bag. I had to argue my case and she would only process the return with supervisor approval. Ok  I got my refund  but not without a fight.   I have to say  none of this makes me want to really order from you any more  and I won t pay postage to have it delivered to my house. I m not really expecting any follow up  just wanted you to know that Bexhill Sainsbuys are rubbish!

Sometimes they can advise on TV faults & save you a trip. There number is 0800 328 1700, option 4. If not, a non itemised statement will be accepted by the store. I'd always advise calling them in advance to explain to the customer service team that you are coming back to store with the TV. Kirsty;2016-05-19T17:26:45+0000;0

The pain was excruciating and my son screamed the place down. It could have quite easily broken his nose. I was disgusted that not one member of staff came to our aid to see if we were ok and when I told the lady that served me  she simply said  oh sorry about that . I could not believe the complete lack of concern and indeed customer service.

As you're based in France & to save you a call, I've given our Entertainment team a phone to ask your questions. They've advised the following: 1-  it can take up to 90 days for books to transfer over, however if we don't have them available the these would not be transferred. 2- if you have a UK bank account & registered UK address with the entertainment site, then you should be able to to access the site in France. If you don't have a UK address or bank, then unfortunately you wouldn't be able to use the site as we're a UK based company. I hope this information help! Thanks, Kirsty;2016-05-18T18:27:15+0000;0

The customer even insisted  for all to hear  that the teller  put the change on the counter  I don t want to touch a Pakistani.  Well done Sir  you refused to take his ignorant bait.;2016-05-16T18:12:14+0000;10154837256469377_10154837570234377;464bd3ab80b2330788f5355cef3e375c54e2e05a;0;Why do you feel the need to describe the till assistant as a ""bearded Asian"" rather than just say ""till assistant""?;2016-05-16T20:31:06+0000;0

Most of the delivery crew are lovely  polite  kind and always baring a smile. However  in the past few weeks  I have had one called Julia  who is nothing more than a thug. She approaches my door like a hitman  deliberately pulling up her sleeves to display the huge tattoos on her generous biceps. She talks to the customer like she s a 13-year-old chav who s sole purpose is to make the residents of the street they re on suffer. You know the ones  the ones who proudly boast about their ASBOS like it s a university doctorate? Well  anyway  that’s the only way to describe the behaviour of this Julia Pritchard character. I digress. Back to my complaint  I am a woman of almost 40 years  with a daughter that approaches 20 in a few short weeks. Unfortunately  due health complications  I can’t always be the person to greet the driver and receive my groceries  but my daughter never fails to open the door with the manners that have been instilled in her since birth. Julio came a couple of weeks back and got irate with my daughter because in her own words ‘she looks under 25’. Well  I should hope so  seeing as she’s net met her second decade yet. My daughter pointed out that she never get’s Id’d by any of the other drivers  and seeing as there is never alcohol or other restricted items and that the house was clearly undergoing major constructions  asked was it really necessary. Julio argued her point  and my daughter gracefully relented. There were a couple of substitutions on the list so my daughter called out to me to ask if they were suitable. Upon hearing my voice  Julio  took great offence and told me to “get up and sign for my own shopping!” Now  after paying for a service  and having my adult daughter present to sign for the groceries  do you think that was appropriate? For all she knew  I could’ve been laid up with a full body cast! Anyway  my daughter expressed her displeasure at her blatant disrespect for her mother to which the delivery girl responded with shouting and swearing  and a whole lot of stepping up into my daughters space in order to look down upon her. I  of course telephoned head office to complain  and was assured that they didn’t want to lose a customer and that I wouldn’t have to lay eyes upon her again… Having caught you up to speed  this brings us to this morning. A rapturous knocking on my front door sent my little dog into a frenzy  so I instructed my daughter to remove him so that the delivery person wouldn’t be exposed to any threat. Once it was in hand  I opened the door with the same smile I use to greet everyone. The first thing that struck me was the offensive stance of this woman. And the second was that she seemed unprepared to see me standing there. After recovering from her shock  she groused  in a most unpleasant manner  “Oh  are you signing for the shopping this week?” Odd  no? I responded  nonetheless. “Yes.” She regarded me for a moment before hitting me with the most ridiculous request. “I need ID…” I laughed  and asked  “Are you serious?” “Yeah!” was her gruff response. Of course  this only served to aggravate me  as anyone and their blind grandma can see that I’m over 25 –four decades  remember?– Anyhow  I told her that I certainly will not be producing identification  that I’m almost 40 years old  and that the ID she saw only recently was that of my adult daughter. She made a flip remark under her breath  to which I reminded her  this happened a couple of weeks ago with her. She responded with a wolfish grin  “You don’t want your shopping  then?” I do not negotiate with those who try to terrorise me. So I asked her why she was here  I was assured by head office that I wouldn’t have to deal with her unpleasantness again. My weekly grocery bill alone is probably more than she gets paid. Anyway  with that  she threw my paperwork at me  told me to “Shop at Asda ” and walked away with my groceries still on her van. Now  I wish to point out that I have been using Sainsbury’s online shopping for in excess of a year now  and have only ever had two complaints. Both times it has been with her. I don’t know her or anything about her  so why would I have any problem with her? I ask you  would you put up with being treated this way in your own home? I have been up to the store AND have called the online delivery helpline to complain about this matter. I am posting this because I want something done about this menacing woman. If she’s treating me like this  then I’m sure she’s the same way with other innocent service users. My biggest fear is that she may be doing this to the more vulnerable members of society  the elderly  for example  especially those who are too afraid to speak out for fear of reprisal.  Please feel free to share this post  especially if you’ve found yourself the victim of a power mad delivery boy. You do not have to tolerate bullying  regardless of what these bullies say.

I have been up to the store AND have called the online delivery helpline to complain about this matter. I am posting this because I want something done about this menacing woman. If she’s treating me like this  then I’m sure she’s the same way with other innocent service users. My biggest fear is that she may be doing this to the more vulnerable members of society  the elderly  for example  especially those who are too afraid to speak out for fear of reprisal.  Please feel free to share this post  especially if you’ve found yourself the victim of a power mad delivery boy. You do not have to tolerate bullying  regardless of what these bullies say. Empower the weak. Empower yourself.;2016-05-16T13:05:26+0000;10154836572014377_10154837160549377;b9ed65f52e84050dc0620cb0139989d09e4b26b8;0;Lol, Jo, you haven't changed a bit.

While some are available one week they definitely won t be the next. This is only a few of the items that are included in my weekly shop but it makes it very frustrating when I then have to go to another shop to find the rest. It feels as though the shop is closing down the shelves are so empty at times. 😡;2016-05-15T18:38:54+0000;10154834655694377_10154834916774377;pageowner;0;Hi Tara, all of our products are subject to availability while stocks last however in regards to the spices, we're currently reviewing our range and will be launching a brand new line on June 12 but we've taken these products off-sale until then. I've had a look on the store's stock system and I can see the store had around 45 four-packs of ripen at home avocado today, but our ripe & ready avocado are currently on hold and that will be why you haven't seen those particular ones in stock. Our store are currently awaiting a delivery tomorrow of the Vittoria vine tomatoes too, which is great news. As for the mince, did you ask for any assistance in store? I can see we had plenty in stock, however the store accepted an additional delivery today so there will be more on shelf tomorrow. I hope this helps. Ryan.;2016-05-15T20:53:20+0000;0

I was very unhappy with a member of staff.  As I approached the lifts at the top of the carpark the children decided to race me to the bottom as I waited for the lift by using the stairs. You had an employee with trolleys waiting for the lift.  As I waited he was very visibly shacking his head. The lift arrived and I put my hand in front of the door. Your employee was still annoyed at me  so I said to him  there is enough room in here if you want to come in?  he shook his head and told me that  Its fine  you go ahead. I know my place.  I was shocked and said  Sorry?  there is room in here for you too  He then told me  You are obviously more important then me!  He was very aggressive and it made me very annoyed and upset.  I went straight to customer service and made a complaint. The chap there was very pleasant and told me that the guy is  special . He was referring to the fact that the guy upstairs has learning difficulties I think. I was also told that sometimes he doesn t necessarily know what he is saying.  I met up with my wife who had arranged to meet myself and the kids and I explained to her  and she told me that the same guy on a previous visit had rammed her with trollies as she waited for a lift.  As I did my shopping and came back round  I saw the  special  guy speaking to security and the man I spoke to at customer service.  When I went back to the car  he was at the top again just staring at me.  I understand that you are an equal opportunities employer and that any member of the public would allow for people with learning issues and I would do exactly the same  but your employee made me very upset.  I think you should really look at whether this is the place for this guy in particular. Your other employee made it clear to me that I am not the first to complain about him and within our immediate family he has upset myself and my wife.  I would really think about returning to that store.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards  Johnathon Dewey;2016-05-15T16:51:18+0000;10154834396984377_10154834719189377;pageowner;0;I'm really sorry the customer service wasn't up to scratch Johnathon.

Hope you don't use Sky or Virgin too, as they have signed up! Want to go on holiday? Better check the tour operator you use because plenty of them are signed up too!!!  But it will save you loads of money no doubt....so that's a bonus eh?!!!  And if you did a bit of research, you might have found this.....  https://www.bluelightcard.co.uk/index.php?p=nhsdiscounts  So there you go, these highly valued workers do get discounts, like our highly valued veterans and serving armed forces personnel.;2016-05-15T17:01:31+0000;11

People working for the NHS do get discounts, more generally most places have reduced prices for children, students, people claiming certain benefits, people who qualify for state pension etc.    People who wear a uniform to work or provide their own tools, equipment or pay for membership to professional bodies can claim tax back for it, although this uniform tax break excludes the armed forces for some reason.  And it's not because the uniform is provided and washed for them, because that's not the case.  They often have to buy pieces of kit and are responsible for washing it all.   Best add going to certain cinemas, theme parks, coffee shops, fast food outlets to the list of companies you won't use, as lots of them offer a forces discount. In fact, best ask every single business you use what discounts they offer, and to whom, before you give them your money.;2016-05-15T17:37:46+0000;3

I felt quite upset after leaving. The cafe was quite busy and the staff were really doing an excellent job. They were some delays with the food coming out  however I think this was due to the demand alone and definitely not due to the staff who were working so very hard. This led to some frustration with some customers and this was directed at the staff. I witnessed this and the young girl who was working the till dealt with it in an amazing manner  she was so polite and professional. However she was clearly upset by the conversation (and quite rightly so) and I really felt for her. They staff must surely feel so demoralised after working in such conditions and it is very unfair. I wanted to post this on here as I am hoping for 2 things. 1. For this to be recognised and for the staff to perhaps be given some more support at what is bound to be a busy period. 2. For the staff to know that they are very much appreciated and undeserving of such criticism.  Could you please feed this back to the Biggleswade store?  Many thanks  Jane;2016-05-14T12:57:03+0000;10154831048244377_10154831285079377;pageowner;0;Thanks Jane. When did this happen? Can you PM us the name of the colleague or perhaps her description?

I ve never had an issue with them before but very recently they ve started leaving thin white plastic threads on my toddler when I change them. They get really stuck to her skin and that s causing her distress at nappy change. I can t put a photo up because of where it is but it s happening at every change.  I don t want to change my brand because these are the only nappies that I ve found to not leak but it s quite irritating. Is there any reason it s just started happening?  She s in size 6 if that is relevant.  Thanks.;2016-05-14T12:41:19+0000;10154831014284377_10154831112694377;pageowner;0;How strange, really sorry the nappies haven't been up to scratch recently!

We had a lovely day looking at  and interacting with  the animals there. On the way home we stopped off at our local Sainsburys store to pick up some groceries. One of the things we bought was an 800g loaf of Giraffe Bread. However  despite the name  imagine my son s disappointment upon returning home and tearing into the bread  only to find it contained no giraffes. Not even one. Not even a little one. Understandably he felt cheated and betrayed by the Sainsburys brand and was all for vowing never to spend his money in Sainsburys again  instead planning on saving up for a loaf of Tiger bread from Asda  as he likes tigers almost as much as he likes giraffes. I reassured him that I would write to you and urge you to put warning stickers on the loaves so that other children do not fall foul of this fair trading faux pas. What next... chicken curry without the chicken? Belgian buns with no Belgians in? What stunt are you trying to pull here  Sainsburys  tricking little kids out of their pocket money?;2016-05-13T16:03:32+0000;10154828928004377_10154828969344377;pageowner;0;Hey there Ken!

My local store do collect for the food bank... items purchased by us, the customers. They have a noticeboard of things they do for charity, so if a store were donating money, time, goods or events, we'd know about it. As a writer I am often asked to do events, book festivals, workshops etc for free and to write pieces too. When I was a teacher, nobody ever asked me to work for nothing. Do you work for free Matt? I do indeed do freebies now, but for good causes rather than for multi million corporations who can more than afford to pay a fair fee for a good job. xxx;2016-05-13T14:46:09+0000;0

Have since checked with 4 other pharmacies and my gp  all of which have confirmed that it is available to purchase over the counter. I was ignored point blank by one member of staff when returning to the pharmacy desk and the gentleman I spoke with refused to even check the computer to see if it was available otc (I knew it was as have bought it before) I understand that dropping the pack in the sink on a Sunday morning was not my best moment  however I would have liked to have been given the time of day at least.;2016-05-12T21:52:03+0000;10154827118414377_10154828249014377;pageowner;0;Sorry about this Ella!

The gentleman spent the entirety of a two-three mile long  50mph speed-limit road around two metres distance from the rear of my vehicle  used incorrect lanes to attempt to hop a moving traffic que at traffic lights  and indicated that he wanted to re-enter the correct lane in a dangerous manner. Unable to do so  he then held up traffic in the wrong lane whilst waiting for an opportunity to return  and then returned to driving within 2 metres of my vehicle whilst I patiently waited for a cyclist to reach an appropriate point at which I could pass safely. The number plate of the van was PK56 SYS  and the driver appeared to be an older gentlemen of around 45-60 years of age.  Please keep me informed as to what your company is prepared to do in this instance  as I felt I was pressured to exceed the speed limit (something I did not do)  and feared there could be a crash.

I purchased it specifically due to Garnier using Mexoryl® SX which is an exceptionally photostable sun filter. Before putting it on  looking at the ingredients  there is no Mexoryl but Avobenzone which is very photo unstable. I then looked at the date of manufacture and saw that it is 22H103 which is January 2011 - which probably is why no Mexoryl and which is way past the 36 month shelf life recommended by Garnier. This is really dangerous for an SPF product. Please can you advise? Thank you;2016-05-12T15:00:30+0000;10154826294989377_10154826422754377;pageowner;0;Sorry about this Kath.

And L'real/Garnier advise that their products have a 36 month shelf life after the manufacture date. You can google for the details Whilst probably not an issue for most stuff, just meaning for example active ingredients wouldn't be active after that time maybe - for sun filters, that is very dangerous if they become inactive or not effective.;2016-05-12T17:43:31+0000;0

I had to go in to take some bits back for Click & Collect.  However there was another customer giving them hell about Maris Piper potatoes. From what I could work out  the fresh produce lad has brought out every last bag of MP potatoes and none was good enough for Mrs high almighty. The customer service staff had put various calls out- but nothing was good enough. How the staff kept their cool I ll never know but she was rude and disrespectful and even interrupted my transaction with the staff member. In the end the manager was called at her request- from what I could see she was getting very animated and irate with the manager. The staff were clearly upset  but kept their professionalism at all times  they are a credit to you. I d have told her to leave the branch. They can t select what arrives in branch- not do they have control over what s grown!!

Having been given one of your Hoovers as an Xmas present last year  it suddenly packed up mid hoover yesterday and no amount of intervention and fuse swapping would fix it. A nightmare more than normal  as I have an open house on Saturday to try and sell my property! I duly phoned the laughably named Electrical Support Team  who appear to be just another version of customer service  offering no advice and refusing to help without a proof of purchase. No receipt available... Arghhh!  I went to the store  with the person who purchased it today  to see if they would be able to trace it back using the SKU and her card number  but without hesitance or quibble  she simply exchanged it and even kept the replacement in its large box behind the counter until we had finished shopping. She was polite  smiley and more than willing to do that bit extra for her customers - a true example of what you expect from a Customer Service colleague.  My faith was restored after an extremely unhelpful and frustrating interaction with the  electrical support team   Y A happy customer  now  with a fully operational hoover  (operator details: S00556 / C1015);2016-05-11T19:52:20+0000;10154824460359377_10154824538664377;pageowner;0;Really pleased my colleague could help, it's always lovely to hear!

Please can you acknowledge them for there excellent customer service and just for simply being amazing people!!!  They went above and beyond to help me when I returned to the petrol station distraught that I had lost my wallet with £500 of euros in it (all my savings) and my driving licence and my bank cards etc when I am due to leave on the ferry tomorrow for my holiday to Belgium. My holiday would have been ruined and I would not only have lost all that money but also I would have been unable to go at all without my driving licence and bank card.   I was utterly gutted and in pieces and when i explained the situation to the staff in the petrol station (I believe there names were Jane and Natasha  sorry if I have got them wrong as I was in a bit of a state) they went far above and beyond there job to help me.  Natasha checked the Cctv with Jane and they found my car leaving and we could see the wallet on the roof as I drove out so Jane came out with me up and down the road searching the bushes and roundabout for my wallet.   Meanwhile Natasha phoned the main store to see if they had it handed in. Well when myself and Jane returned empty handed I was totally a mess as we couldn t find it and was met by Natasha at the petrol station who was smiling and said good news  it had been handed in at the main store.  I simply broke down as I was sure my holiday (the first one I could afford in 3 years) was ruined and these lady s at the petrol station and the customer service team in the main store and the amazing people whoever they were that had handed it in all deserve medals!  They went out of there way to help and care and they really are great people so please can you give them any kind of award on my behalf as without these people I just don t know what I would have done. They are stars and you should be proud and honoured to have such super people working for you and shopping with you it shows your really have the best staff and customers!

Natasha checked the Cctv with Jane and they found my car leaving and we could see the wallet on the roof as I drove out so Jane came out with me up and down the road searching the bushes and roundabout for my wallet.   Meanwhile Natasha phoned the main store to see if they had it handed in. Well when myself and Jane returned empty handed I was totally a mess as we couldn t find it and was met by Natasha at the petrol station who was smiling and said good news  it had been handed in at the main store.  I simply broke down as I was sure my holiday (the first one I could afford in 3 years) was ruined and these lady s at the petrol station and the customer service team in the main store and the amazing people whoever they were that had handed it in all deserve medals!  They went out of there way to help and care and they really are great people so please can you give them any kind of award on my behalf as without these people I just don t know what I would have done. They are stars and you should be proud and honoured to have such super people working for you and shopping with you it shows your really have the best staff and customers!  I thank them and your customer who handed it in from the bottom of my heart. There are some great people in this world and you have some great customers and fantastic staff.

They've advised me that they usually receive their deliveries at 6.50am. They've contacted the other stores that are nearby to ask about their deliveries and timings however they don't receive deliveries at this hour. They've also contacted the council to investigate further but they have advised they haven't received any complaints specifically about Sainsburys. Are you able to PM us the registration plate number of the Arla delivery van or perhaps some time stamped photographs so we can investigate further? Amanda.;2016-05-12T11:31:34+0000;0

Do you expect me to leave my child alone and walk to the car park at 5.50am??! I have time coded photos taken from my window. Funnily in exactly the same spot a 6.50am divert took place today. And, yes, this morning it was 6.50am! Funny that!! Do you think I'm making this up? They have had complaints, I know of at least 3 people! One of whom is part of the Friends of Brockenhurst neighbourhood society. NFDC have received over 30 complaints about it. Arla Dairy admitted delivering to your store way before the 7am curfew. And a member of staff admitted they are there from 6am and accept deliveries. Yes, I'm sure there are other culprits, however this only started to occur daily when you opened. Tesco's do not need to come into the village car park, they have there own. They are also banned from receiving deliveries before 7am (the same issue occurred with them, they stopped) That's me never shopping in your store again and my Nectar card cut up. If they could just fess up and change it, that'd be nice.;2016-05-12T11:41:59+0000;0

On Sunday  8th may I was at my local store in leigh and after finishing my shop I went to pay on my card where I was informed (after the 1st attempt) there was a problem and the card was declined. The problem being in store  staff was trying to get the card to work on different tills where I was informed it was happening to others aswell. Not bothered at all at what happened I left the store happy. Monday morning I went to the bank and had the shock of my life (monday morning still half asleep) when funds had gone. After a conversation with my bank I found out I had been charged 5 times for the Sunday shop. I phoned the local store and was put through to the department manager and in the conversation he assured me that they where aware of the problem as it wasn t a isolated incident and promised us our money would be back with us by the end of Monday. Happy with this promise and still finding the funny side we left the issue alone and continued our day. Later Monday afternoon the manager phoned us back saying IT was aware and again assured us the money will be in our bank that day. Tuesday may 10th (our rent day) the funds not returned landlord charge for late rent bank charges for bounced standing order. Not happy at all. Phoned the store again and was put to a different manager as the man I spoke with yesterday was of (no issues with that everyone deserves days off) after explaining everything to him he apologized and gave me the customer service phone number as they will help.....  So I phone CUSTOMER SERVICES. wow after fully explaining what had happened  I was replied  sorry we know what happened you ll be paid back in 5working days  I explained again what happened and due to a failed promise from management (that we put our trust in) we had incurred charges was no longer happy with this and would like to speak to a CUSTOMER SERVICE manager replied  I ve said what will happen and no   after confirming the reply mainly the being told no to speaking to a manager the woman on the phone just said  no  a hung the phone up! What. This is your customer service? Management can make false promises regardless and very rude customer service  not a happy customer at all.;2016-05-10T16:26:57+0000;10154821488749377_10154821747679377;pageowner;0;I am very sorry about this Camilla. I can completely understand why you are frustrated about this issue. I would like to address both the initial refund issue as well as the customer service issue. Can you please PM what time you were in store at? This will help the management team find your specific failed transactions. Can you also provide us the contact number you used to call our careline? What time was this call made at? We can get this call listened to. Grant;2016-05-10T18:24:24+0000;0

It feels a little like a slap in the face for your coeliac customers  who have enthusiastically purchased from your generally wide range of gluten free items. Instead of feeling looked after and having our custom appreciated  we are left feeling that our custom is better appreciated by competing supermarkets.

After walking around the store for an hour or so  hubby was finished so went to checkout. He loaded it all up  the lady put it through and then the machines stopped working. She tried to put it through twice but decided it had failed and asked him to leave as they were closing. It was 4pm. Apparently the cash machines were out of order too. So he left with no shopping at 4pm on Sunday   he drove around for some time and found a tesco express shop open. He got a few items but because of my health barely anything as I need wholefoods and organic. We realised that the payment had infact gone through today and popped back in expecting an apology and a refund. Instead served by the same lady again  she sent him away with no refund or way of apology. She told him that it s his problem now.  The bank will apparently be able to refund him. I am sat outside the bank now  have been for twenty minutes already. We love sainsburys choice and range but have been left really upset by the treatment within the store  no word of apology for hours of wasted time and money that we simply did not have spare.  I am really disappointed 😞;2016-05-10T12:07:32+0000;10154821052619377_10154826208199377;pageowner;0;Hi, can you PM me a contact number and a preferred time for a phone call to discuss this with you?

When it came the  sausage  in the children s meal was clearly of very inferior quality and when I tasted it (luckily my son chose to spit it out) was frankly disgusting. I wouldn t feed something like that to my dog. I was told that children s meals come ready made while adult meals are made on the premises.  The ingredients list for the children s sausage showed they contain only 18% meat. This is legally not a sausage which must be 42% meat. I will be contacting trading standards about this. I am horrified that sainsburys consider children unworthy of the same standard of food as adults  and that they would serve something which is clearly not as described.

I popped in to Sainsbury s to buy some essentials and left my 4 week old baby in the car with my mum. Just coming to the end of my shop and my mum rings me to tell me my son is crying and appears quite distressed and wants feeding. I m the only person that can feed him as I m breastfeeding. I therefore asked the manager on duty if I could leave my trolley for about 10 mins whilst I pop out to feed my son. She not only said yes to that but offered to put everything through the till for me and pack it all away in my bags so all I had to do was come back into store and pay at customer services and my shopping was all there neatly packed away in my bags ready for me to collect. I was so impressed with this! I have always been a Sainsbury s fan but even more so now! So kind and a massive thank you to the manager. I didn t catch her name sadly.;2016-05-10T06:27:19+0000;10154820601784377_10154820729004377;pageowner;0;Hi Alice, that's fantastic to hear! I'd love to get this fed back to the store manager for you.

Yesterday my card was declined twice so I paid cash only to find two pending transactions from them on my bank account. I phoned my bank and they told me if Sainsbury s sent a fax the money could be released. Sainsbury s refused to do this and said the money would be returned but I explained because of their error I would now incur bank charges because I now don t have the funds to cover my direct debits. Sainsbury s weren t interested.

As i was queing up to pay i noticed a shopping basket full of ripe browning bananas. I asked the assistant on the till if they are reduced and she said that they were not for sale and need to be thrown away. I was totaly shocked they were just a little brown  the colour bananas go when they are ripe. I asked if i could purchase some as would have been perfect for cooking and lovely and sweet to eat. Again she was adamant that they were not allowed to be sold as they were no good.  I was totally shocked that they were going to go straight into the bin. As i was leaving the assistant said to another girl working were going have to move them which had given me the impression i hadnt been the first person to ask about them. Which means therr coyld have bern some happy customers and sales through the till. I know stores like asda bag them up and sell them for 10-20p a bag. As your company is so commited at getting thier customers to reduce thier own food waste i would have though you would have been commited too. There are even plenty of charities or homeless shelters im sure theses could have helped or neen used to create something else. Im really disappointed and will think twice before shopping there again.;2016-05-08T06:20:09+0000;10154815061054377_10154815257104377;pageowner;0;Hi there Jayde, you can read more about our approach to waste here: http://bit.ly/1Ba8lEP.

I have spoken to the store manager who has clarified this issue. All rolls are made from scratch in the store, with the exception of the scotch morning and brioche rolls. Unfortunately, because of how busy the store was this morning, the store were only able to provide the scotch morning rolls. These rolls may have still been slightly frozen as demand meant that the store were having to sell them before they could thaw. I hope this helps, Grant;2016-05-07T12:46:19+0000;0

I was shopping in Sainsbury s Lincoln store today with a very tired / ill  3 yr old.  My husband and I had started shopping. Half a trolley full   we get a call from one of my sons  school. He s not well can we pick him up. 😕  Well  you can imagine the scene. We re about 8 miles from the school  half a trolley of shopping and a screaming  (literally ) 3 yr old. She hadn t stopped since we walked in  wouldn t calm down for anything. We were going past the fresh fruit aisle  struggling with the still screaming 3 yr old & discussing what we would do..... (and still  she s screaming 😔) A member of staff came up to us   said:  excuse me  is she OK?    Me:   yes  just can t stop her crying  Staff:   Would she like a piece of fruit  banana  whilst you re walking around and getting sorted?  Me:  Oh  yes please  thank you   And honestly  she ate that banana and didn t cry again in store. As silly as it may sound  that one act of random kindness from your staff member helped us no end! We were able to pay for the shopping we already had and get out to pick up my son with no more issues. As we were leaving the store we saw him again  he came and asked if she was any better and wished us well with our son. My point with this  is that one small act  of taking a minute to ask if we were okay changed the next few hours for the better. His name is Neville and I d like to thank him for doing that. It s not done as much as it should be in this day and age. So Thank you Neville  your one act of random kindness helped.;2016-05-06T19:12:57+0000;10154811206569377_10154812440329377;1872c59517da21f2c8a2f912aa503f5136ec6ba5;1;Yes, thank you. My little girl (3yr old) had a sleep and was fine. And my son came home and went to bed. Both much better this morning. And Thank you. It was more the fact that he'd seen we were struggling and stopped what he was doing to help. Nowadays people are too busy with their heads down to notice, Thanks again, Sarah.;2016-05-07T08:06:34+0000;1

However, the price of your tart cases and fresh strawberries (which your bakers use) does not appear to have increased. I'm assuming then that confectioners custard and strawberry compote prices have shot through the roof? Or maybe the increase in minimum wages has prompted this unreasonable price hike. There is no justification for a 33% increase. Regards.;2016-05-06T17:10:52+0000;0

Got to the till and the pack came up as £5.50. I queried it. A member of staff went to check and came back with the answer: £4.50 a kilo for small joints of less than a kilo but £5.50 for the medium 1 kilo joints. But it s NOT stated on the packet! As all my shopping was already unloaded onto the belt at the check out and there were customers waiting to be served after me I decided not to go back and choose an alternative joint but paid the £5.50 rather than swap it for the cheaper smaller joint I was offered at the checkout. I should have gone to the customer service desk to complaint but rushed home instead. However  it has occurred to me that  if all the Sainsbury s in Dorset or even nationally are doing the same and lots of customers are tricked into paying £5.50 instead of £4.50 unknowingly for their purchase  that amounts to an awful of extra profit.

This is an extensive review. Some of the changes include removing many Schwartz products from sale and introducing a much wider selection of our own brand products in redesigned packaging and new shelves in store. We'll also be reviewing our range of speciality ingredients. As a result of this, we'll be withdrawing some products from sale in the lead up to the official launch date on the 12th June. Some withdrawn products will be discontinued and others will be relaunched when the review goes live. Hope this helps, Danny.;2016-05-06T11:24:21+0000;0

She tried to explain the matter to him thinking he had misunderstood and he threatened to have security remove her from the store ! She is 71 years old and was very shook up by this experience ! She had been a loyal customer since it was built !  We took the matter to the police and also to card services, no one bothered calling her back from sainsburys card services it was left up to us to do all the chasing up ! One conversation I had with Bev a duty manager in the store last week confirmed that the cards had been withdrawn from sale due to fraud ! Why wasn't my mum contacted and an apology made ?

Once a first aider came approx 8/9 minutes after the incident there didn't even have a first aid box.

Given the unprecedented cuts to Local Authority budgets by the Government, it's understandable that unpopular routes might have to be cut to balance the books.

Me and my partner always shop at Sainsburys and have constantly been told to try Morrisons as it is  so much cheaper . So today we decided to give that statement a chance and we went to our local Morrisons. I can quite honestly say it was the biggest mistake we have made this bank holiday - almost every item that we normally buy was at least 40-60p more expensive and we ended up having to get a budget shop in Morrisons for the same amount that we would get a  treat ourselves  shop from Sainsburys. (Also like to add that the 3 for 10 offer on meat in Morrisons is worth half the value you get from meat in Sainsburys... Just saying!) So I d like to apologise for not keeping to our roots and believing other hype.... And I would like to thank you for first of all keeping your prices low and secondly for awarding us with some lovely vouchers when we went into your Ripley store straight after  because we forgot butter 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😀;2016-05-02T14:30:46+0000;10154800193319377_10154800218929377;pageowner;0;No problem Mike, glad to have you back!

I would like to say a massive thank you to Trudy at your South Ruislip Store on Long Drive Ruislip. I could see she was busy on the bakery section when I asked if they had the Mascarpone Truffle Cake in stock which  I wanted for my daughters birthday   which is displayed on the fresh cream cake display.  She said the last time she checked it was out of stock however she went to double check again to see if it had come during the night delivery. Yes it did and I was so happy as this saved me a trip to the cake shop. Trudy was busy and I believe she deserves to be recognised. Many of your competitors that I have been to always find the easy way out by saying  they don t have it in-stock  however Trudy went out of her way and I really appreciate that. I was served by Adam on the checkout who was friendly. It was quite funny as there was a fishy smell which we tried to work out where it was coming from. All your staff at this store are helpful  bubbly and very friendly. If you ask where something is they will offer to take you there even though they are busy. Fantastic and keep up the excellent customer service.;2016-05-02T05:54:33+0000;10154799403704377_10154799544259377;pageowner;0;That's great feedback Anita!

I placed the order to be collected at the Redditch store at 10.30am this morning.  We arrived just after 10.30am to find that the Click and Collect station is just a couple of car park spaces at the back of the car park - no shelter from the elements - next to a space for a van.  As the van was no where to be seen and there were others waiting my husband went into the store to be told that the order was coming from Longbridge!  Were we wrong to think that they would pick the items from the large store in whose car park we were waiting?  The van arrived about 10 minutes later and the driver was apologetic as he d had to fill in at last minute  fine  this happens.   What about your environmental footprint Sainsbury?    What about your customer experience - if it had been lashing down with rain  everything - shopping  driver and customer would have been soaked?    Unbelievably you didn t have a 4pt skimmed milk and had to supply 2 x 2pts and my 18 pack of toilet paper just didn t turn up!    Observations are that if you are trying to get more people to use this service-and I m sure you are otherwise why give vouchers with such an attractive discount-think about how this service is provided.  If you re not picking at the large store where it s collected then don t offer the service there. It s supposed to save time for the customer!!  It s cost me more in time as I had to then go and purchase toilet paper from the store  and frustration levels are high.
