But really sometimes happens something totally weird. This is the current situation in the Farnborough (Hampshire) unit since a couple of days: Highland spring water  50p for a bottle of 1.5l. Great price! Reduced from 60p. So you get the pack of 6 and you pay... 3.20£. Now this is in contrast with the laws of the market (if you buy a bunch of the same item the price of the singe unit diminishes). Obviously it is also in contrast with the math: 6 time 0.50p = 3.00£. So... if you buy more  you spend... more then what you expect.  Isn t it weird?;;;;;2016-05-31T21:20:34+0000;1464729634;2016-05-31 23:20:34;0;5;0;0;5;5;1;4;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I take full responsibility for that but given that the order was for a very large shop  the person I spoke to in the customer service department wasn t at all interested in trying to help me out or find any kind of solution. That then left me with 13 people arriving for a weekend for a special family celebration and no food so I had to rush out myself to go and buy enough for that evening. It was arranged that the shop would then come on Saturday morning first thing but it was only the alcohol and the cupboard produce that arrived - there was no fresh produce. The alcohol also had all their security tags on them which meant we were unable to open any of them. Again  no help from your customer service team who told me they couldn t deliver it until 2pm - so yet again  I had to rush out to the supermarket to go and buy enough for breakfast for everyone. I tried to get hold of your online manager there on a number of occasions and it wasn t until my third message that she called me back. I was expecting to hear back from her with some sort of solution or compensation for all the extra food I had to buy but have heard nothing from her. I shop with you every week and have always had a very good experience but this really is completely unacceptable and so disappointing. During such a competitive time when I would have thought that supermarkets would be trying to keep their loyal and regular customers  this is definitely not what I would have expected.;;;;;2016-05-31T18:16:10+0000;1464718570;2016-05-31 20:16:10;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We had only had it a couple of weeks and it start making funny noises which we later learnt it was the compressor not working correctly  few months later it completely broke down and we were with out a Fridge freezer for 6 weeks Argos refused to replace it  sent a engineer from Indesit He showed my Husband how to deal with the noise problem which is a joke as my husband is not a well man. It has broke again and have now wait 4 weeks for an engineer one due out on the 7th never turned up on the 24th no phone call ! Argos will not replace with out an independent assessment  which is madness as we have to pay for it we paid £500 on the 31st of October 2014 a new fridge freezer should last at least 5 years not just 8 months as its now 18months later we sit here withno food in a fridge due to the fact we can only buy on a daily basis as to put in fridge it all goes off .Cheese ham and cook beef from saturday had to be throw away this morning. All we want is a replacement so we can shop and cook meals We will never shop from Argos again..;;;;;2016-05-31T13:24:26+0000;1464701066;2016-05-31 15:24:26;0;15;0;0;15;15;2;13;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I went and explained my situation and was told I couldn t use a toilet! Then they told me the nearest one is about 5 minutes walk away  to which I explained I wasn t able to hold it any longer. I left the store in tears and had to return to my car. My husband drove me to waitrose  where I was able to use a toilet  we then did our shop there instead. I am absolutely disgusted that your staff were unable to help me  a pregnant woman in a desperate situation!;;;;;2016-05-30T07:43:32+0000;1464594212;2016-05-30 09:43:32;1;8;1;0;9;7;6;1;3;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

After about a year at £1  my usual Thursday delivery slot shot up to £3 overnight. I grumbled  but I m paying it because the drivers continue to arrive within my chosen hour  unfailingly cheerful  polite and helpful  and it s still a reasonable price.   I wish I could say the same for the people who pack the boxes for delivery. Standards are definitely on the decline. Last Thursday I discovered that my milk containers had been placed on their sides in the bottom of a box  and then so much had been thrown  on top  that one of the bottles had leaked milk all over the bottom of the box. Had I not needed the contents of that box I would have sent the whole thing back  but as it was  the driver kindly refunded me the items that had to have packaging completely removed  and also for the rather dented  leaky bottle of milk.   The driver was brilliant; he got some paper towel to help me dry all the items in the box so I could take them to my kitchen. They all had to be washed before I could put them away to avoid the stink of dried milk.  After the driver had gone  I found more items whose packaging had to be disposed of as it had become saturated with milk. I was too fed up to bother chasing refunds etc. and that s really not what I m after anyway. These packing errors make the drivers  jobs more difficult than they already are  and that s just not fair on them.  This isn t the first time I ve had to be refunded for damaged goods  or for rotten fruit/veg. The standard used to be great  but since more people are opting for online services  the standards in the warehouses seems to be slipping somewhat. The delivery drivers - in my area at least - remain some of the best ambassadors for Sainsbury s and you should be proud of them. I wish I could say the same for the pickers/packers; it s as if they simply don t care.";;;;;2016-05-30T07:27:38+0000;1464593258;2016-05-30 09:27:38;0;4;0;0;4;4;1;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I picked up a multi pack of Diet Pepsi and wine just run out of it all over my floor. I purchased proseco for my sisters special birthday and they were all ruined with sticky ripped labels. Can t present them as a gift now. All my other bottles of wine were wet slippery sticky and  the same. So there I was 11 pm at night washing my floor of wine and washing bottles and cans. I rang to the number on my invoice to complain. They said store would contact me. They rang whilst I was out and left a message to say they had refunded me the 3 bottles that had broke. No apology no mention of all the other damaged soaking wet items they left me with. So furious the delivery driver was more concerned he now had to fill in paper work for the 3 broken bottles. Not a great impression for a new customer safe to say no customer service or apology.

I pointed out that you are again and illegally fly posting in Central Milton Keynes. His attitude was one of nonchalance and verging on the surly. He reminded me of my son when he was a errant 14 year old. He told me to tell the local authority and walked off after claiming that somehow donating £12 000 to charity each year allows you to fly-post. Possibly the the poorest show of professionalism I have seen this year. Now Sainsbury s  is illegal fly posting a part of your marketing policy and will a freedom of information request for the risk assessments for this activity be fruitful?;;;;;2016-05-28T13:53:49+0000;1464443629;2016-05-28 15:53:49;0;15;0;0;15;15;1;14;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Your drivers scream around residential streets here and when they nearly cause an accident you will do pretend you care but do nothing.

I ve rang twice about the dumped trolley out the front on my house you refuse to move also.

I am writing now to ask that Sainsbury’s take responsibility for the sustainability of all tuna tins on your shelves - not just your own brand.  Why is Sainsbury’s selling John West tuna?  You know that John West have broken their commitment to clean up their supply chain. Despite this  you continue to stock their unsustainable tuna  caught using large nets associated with Fish Aggregating Devices  a method that causes indiscriminate harm to marine life  and notably to endangered species such as sharks and turtles.  Sainsbury’s has been helping lead the way toward a sustainable tuna market in the UK. But in the last 2 weeks  Tesco and Waitrose said they could drop John West if they don’t reach high sustainability standards and renounce this destructive fishing method. I would expect nothing less from Sainsbury’s.  I sincerely hope you will take action to ensure Sainsbury’s is selling 100% sustainable tuna.;;;;;2016-05-27T12:59:36+0000;1464353976;2016-05-27 14:59:36;1;2;1;0;3;2;2;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Last week we received a voucher for £10 off a £50 online shop. It hadn t printed correctly and so I couldn t see the code. Annoying but tonight this happened again. When we asked for help from the female supervising the self serve she said  no-one even uses them anyway  !! We were given a number to phone and after trying to explain the problem she told us she had to phone the store and that she would phone us back. 2 hours later and still no phone call.

Turns out that you only need to have a child in your car to park in parent and child parking  you have absolutely no need to get them out of the car  even if it leaves people who are taking their young child out of the car in a normal space that does not have the extra room. I always was of the belief that the extra space was to make it easier to strap your child in as the door opens wider or space so the door opens wide enough to get a baby seat in and out. Turns out I m mistaken! Not happy  the child in question was 10 years old so needed no extra help in or out. NOT HAPPY AT THIS SITUATION AT ALL!  Also wondering why st-annes branch is supporting a food bank that will not help ANYONE in our area! We surprisingly and unfortunately have a foodbank in st-annes but for some reason they have chosen to support Blackpool foodbank despite of this. Blackpool foodbank WILL NOT help st-annes residents as it is a separate area to us even though it is only 3 miles to the border! They will only support Blackpool residents. Seems bizarre to me when we can support the local one.;;;;;2016-05-26T16:24:43+0000;1464279883;2016-05-26 18:24:43;2;11;2;0;13;11;9;2;15;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am against testing on animals and find it increasingly hard to find/locate products that are not tested on animals. What would be REALLY helpful would be if you could have a section of the cruelty free products you sell so that people like myself can go straight there instead of having to search around between all the other products to find the humane ones. Do you think there would be a possibility of this happening? I think think it would be welcomed with open arms by a lot of your customers.

Unfortunately you have failed on your freshness promise  the one thing that usually sets you apart from your competitors. The main bulk of my fresh groceries either expired the same day of the delivery or 1-2 days later! As much as my daughter loves carrot sticks and grapes she is only 3 & cannot eat the lot in 1 day! The carrot sticks were slimey  as were the egg noodles that went off on the day of purchase. None of the short dated produce was delivered in a blue bag to alert me and allow me the chance to send it back (which has been common practice in all of my previous deliveries.) It is only now  2 days later  that I have been forced to investigate the dates of all of the products having opened browning grapes this morning that turn out to have expired yesterday.   Most of my fresh meat and fish also have shorts dates. Forcing me to cook a dinner tonight consisting of salmon  prawns & chicken plus alot of wilting salad and vegetables  in order to not waste any of the food. This should have been 3 dinners for my family. I cannot afford to replace meals based on the incompetence of such a large  usually excellent  supermarket chain.   To top it all off the bread and fruit loaf were delivered squashed. Anyone with a 3 year old will understand that misshapen bread will not do for a sandwich (unless it s in the shape of a gingerbread man so the head can be bitten off!) It s difficult enough to satisfy the ever changing appetite of a toddler without slimey carrot sticks  gone off grapes and plates full of meat and fish.   On a positive note the delivery driver was extremely polite and friendly. Just a shame the vegetables weren t the same.  Yours sincerely  A very dissapointed customer.;;;;;2016-05-26T08:46:28+0000;1464252388;2016-05-26 10:46:28;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The Conservative government is cutting disabled peoples benefits  sanctioning the unemployed and have made begging illegal (both the act of begging and the act of giving).   I am aware that Sainsbury s gives  out of date  produce to Foodbank (and others) to be distributed to the poor. However a person can (typically) only get 3 days of food from Foodbank.   So ... a poor and hungry person has few choices. Commit crime or starve.   What is Sainsbury s thoughts on this situation?  Would Sainsbury s attempt to prosecute a person stealing food?   Your reply  and the thoughts of others is most welcome.;;;;;2016-05-25T23:06:53+0000;1464217613;2016-05-26 01:06:53;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I don t often eat ready meals because of the general low quality across the market but saw the lasagne which appeared to be more of a premium product.  How wrong I was  I can t find any positives at all. The pasta was raw and chewy ( yes I followed the instructions carefully) the whole meal was bulked out with double layers of pasta ( that s why it was raw) and white sauce and had barely  any meat. Basically a raw pasta and white sauce slop.   Even an amateur chef would know a lasagne should have thin layers of béchamel between the beef.         It s obviously bulked out this way to make it more profitable and to be honest it s an insult to my intelligence to think I would be happy to eat this.

I am currently having to shop online  and had received a delivery on Monday this week. The fresh fruit was in a bruised and for me unacceptable condition  further the  fresh berries  costing £3.50 with a sell by date of the next day! I rang and complained  having been advised they would call me from my local store and deliver fresh product to me the next day. This did not happen.  A gentleman called my home saying he was sorry  and would speak to his manager. I was to receive a call  first thing today  for said delivery to be arranged - at 11am I have again called to make a further complaint  was put through to the store where a female (who declined to give her name) advised me  I am sorry about your  missing items   can you tell me what they were and we can deliver it to you  REALLY?????? Are you at all interested in  Customer Service ? She then became totally  un interested  when I attempted to explain  talking over me constantly  leaving me feeling like I NEVER want to shop at your store again - and will NEVER recommend it to anyone! Disgraceful service - we are your customers  PLEASE try to look after us.;;;;;2016-05-25T10:14:03+0000;1464171243;2016-05-25 12:14:03;2;5;2;0;7;5;2;3;2;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I would order again just because he was such a thoughtful and polite man who wanted to make sure I was aware and happy with everything.

I do not do weekly/monthly shops. I go every 1-2 days and buy 3-4 items that i need. But the problem is Bella  i didn t want to leave her alone in the house as its still a new environment for her. And I have to be honest  Sainsbury s have been fantastic.  I spoke to Michael (Duty Manager) & Marie (Customer Service Manager) and they said if i arrive at store just after they open (7am) i can ask a member of staff to go pick up a few bits for me while i wait outside with the dog. While that was fine  i was happy. it s improved.  There is a really nice women called Jill who will not only come outside the store  but hold s Bella while i go in  pick up a few bits of shopping  and another member of staff around the till area (Andy mainly) will just jump on a till so i don t need to mess about with self-scan too.  So if Jill is not working  i will just ask a member of staff to go get me a few bits  but if Jill is working  she will come hold Bella while I go in. I can t even try and explain how awesome she is.

I m hoping you can give me a bit of guidance about an online shop I m trying to do. We re going away shortly  so I m trying to be super organised and sort a food shop for when we return (the 8th of June). I ve just logged in to my account  booked a slot for that day  and started added items as usual. However  I noticed that barely anything is showing as on offer? As we re on quite a tight budget we rely on these offers to form the bulk of our shop. Is this because I m trying to book so far in advance that the offers haven t been determined for that week yet  so aren t available? If this is the case  do you know when they will be available so I can complete the shop? Sadly  if this isn t the case  and it s just that there isn t much on offer  I m afraid I ll have to look at other options and I d really rather not do that :) Thanks in advance for your help!;;;;;2016-05-25T07:00:40+0000;1464159640;2016-05-25 09:00:40;0;5;0;0;5;5;1;4;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Can you please tell me why your company puts sugar in chicken liver parfait? I ve been trying to  Taste the Difference  but frankly all I can taste is sweetness. The ingredients list Madeira wine (3%)  sugar and caramalised sugar. I may be confused about this but I was under the impression that chicken liver parfait is not generally consumed as a desert and so does not need to be sweet. Come to think of it  I m not sure it needs pork fat as the second ingredient on the list either but that s a different story. If I m wrong  and you do intend this as a desert (its definitely sweet enough) could you please advise what you would pair it with. A dollop of squirty cream perhaps?

Yesterday I was at  y Winchmore Hill Store  where I spend a lot of of money every week. I asked for help in packing and a very nice Lady came to help. the cashier called EUNICE   however  continued to talk to a collegue and very slowly attended to the shopping. I had just walked  for 50 mins. To the store and another 40 mins around the store. I was very tired  having had a knee replacement recently and I kindly asked her if she could continue her conversation with her friend later on and see to my shopping.  I did not hear what EUNICE said but could imagine it. When paying I apologised to her and said I was sorry for having to mention it about her service but she was also just ignoring me and nearly throwing the store card at me.  instead of accepting my apology ( which I did. Not even need to make but I am w very nice person and have always treated every shop assistant all my life with friendliness because this is how I like being treated) she started mouthing off to her next 2 customers about me. I was then verbally abused by these LADIES ??? I hope somebody at Sainsbury read this and will answer to me.

Sainsbury’s has been ranked in the top 3 of Greenpeace’s league tables for the past 5 years. I am writing now to ask that Sainsbury’s takes responsibility for the sustainability of all tuna tins on your shelves - not just your own brand.  You know that John West have broken their commitment to clean up their supply chain. Despite this  you continue to stock their unsustainable tuna  caught using large nets associated with Fish Aggregating Devices  a method that causes indiscriminate harm to marine life  and notably to endangered species such as sharks and turtles.  Sainsbury’s has been helping lead the way toward a sustainable tuna market in the UK. But in the last two weeks  Tesco and Waitrose said they could drop John West if they don’t reach high sustainability standards and renounce this destructive fishing method. I would expect nothing less from Sainsbury’s.  I sincerely hope you will take action to ensure Sainsbury’s is selling 100% sustainable tuna.

I applied for a credit card with Sainsbury s 3 weeks ago and sent my driver’s licence and proof of address to the Card Services team. Sainsbury sent me a letter confirming they had received my ID.

They cannot complete my application because they cannot find my ID!!!!!   The card team confirmed my photographic ID is scanned onto your system and I have a letter from the bank stating Sainsbury’s had it so either its lost on someone’s desk or an employee has stolen it!

There was only one waiter so they were obviously under staffed so it s clear to see that they were rushed off there feet tying to complete orders but obviously not cooking the food properly . When my food came out the sausages looked burnt but stupidly I still ate them (the worst choice I made by far) as they gave me food poisoning to the point were I was being violently sick with diarrhea and shaking    food poisoning was confirmed by the doctor as your food was the only thing I ate that day that would have given me food poisoning . I am so disgusted with the poor quality of food and at the time I waited for my food that 13 hours later made me so ill I and my family will never eat at your restaurant again and this has unfortunately put me off fry ups for life. So thanks very much sainsburys I hope no one else gets as ill as I did from your poor quality of cooking.;;;;;2016-05-23T08:01:56+0000;1463990516;2016-05-23 10:01:56;0;9;0;0;9;9;2;7;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

How wrong was I. My shopping was booked for delivery between 5pm-6pm  I was left a voicemail at 5.20 saying my shopping was not going to be delivered and asked to callback which I did almost straight away. I was told that the driver had a personal emergency and had to go home  therefore my shopping would not be delivered. I told the very unhelpful man on the phone this wasn t acceptable and explained my situation  he went on to say there wasn t anything he could do. I then asked to speak to a manager  I was put through to a manager and was told that he would look into it and call me back. At 8.30pm I still hadn t heard anything so I called sainsburys again  I explained who I was and was told very rudely........ An I quote  yeah  I spoke to you earlier and told you there was nothing we could do an there s still nothing we can do  you will have to re book your delivery or get a refund  I explained to the extremely rude man on the phone that I didn t want to speak to him an asked that he put me through to the manager i had spoken to earlier. The rude man put me through without saying anything leading me to believe he had hung up on me. I spoke to the same manager again (dean) and was told that he had asked someone to contact me earlier an he apologised that they hadn t. Again we discussed my predicament and he s said he would contact me within 10 minutes (I asked dean to find out the rude mans name for me) dean the manager called me back 5 minutes later and said he would book my delivery for first thing the next day and assured me I would have my shopping by 8.30am at the latest  here s hoping! Dean also told me that the rude staff members name was Adam. I am utterly disgusted with the way Adam spoke to me and left disappointed with the lack of service provided by sainsburys! Surely sainsburys should have some sort of contingency plan in place for such  emergencies  as I m sure I wasn t the only customer let down by sainsburys today.;;;;;2016-05-22T23:43:12+0000;1463960592;2016-05-23 01:43:12;3;5;3;0;8;5;1;4;2;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

After half an hour wait for our food I asked where it was to be told it was coming. Then after an hour wait I then asked again to be told that we had been missed off  and they would get it sorted ASAP  when when the food finally turned up it was all dried and uneatable! I complained to the manager who appeared after several more complaints and he said sorry  but did not seem bothered at all. At least 4 people also had a long wait and got a refund. I was not offered a refund or an explanation  just an offer of a free drink!;;;;;2016-05-22T13:19:22+0000;1463923162;2016-05-22 15:19:22;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am posting this through a friend’s wall. Due to the fact many people are getting sacked or disciplinary for speaking out. As the manager we have is a dictator.  Due to the management not being able to manage well and not being able to keep an eye on their staff they have come to a conclusion of totally banning hot drinks and water and food on a shop floor as they think maybe its stolen  yet some colleagues are told they are allowed bottles of water where as others are told to bring sports bottles. Also not allowed to have other company brands of water etc.  It s one rule for one department and another for other departments. People of the tills are allowed bottles. Online shoppers come down with hot drinks. People working in the night with ACs on working in the cold or just need a drink to keep them awake are not allowed. Working all night to deliver a shop that will benefit the sales of the store. Yet we are the ones that are limited and been made to feel as we are prisoners.   Breaks are taken in two groups so people are rushing to use the microwaves causing delays in warming ones food and rushing the food. If someone goes 2 minutes over they get warning letters. We don’t even have time for desserts or a tea after eating.  There have been occasions where managers from other departments have told off colleagues in such a rude manor in front of customers about hot drinks.  I have been working here over 10 years and these problems have started to occur ever since Jonathan Cooke and Jibran Khan got moved to Low Hall.  In the rush of changing things they have forgotten that we are the ones who are the most important part of running the store in terms of stocking shelves and making sure all the products are on the shelf for customers  instead of working with us we are made to feel like slaves being. Mr Khan is a very very rude arrogant man he is also a pervert. He intimidates people and if you speak back you get suspended. He does not listen and interrupts you when you want to speak and starts getting defensive. We should not be made to feel intimidated or bullied or pressurized at work when we work as hardest as we can to deliver the best.   Every year since he started people are unable to get Christmas  Eid or Diwali off. He picks and chooses who he wants to give it too.  Managers never help out if there is a shortage of staff yet they harass us to work like donkeys. Many people have claimed that Mr Khan said he gets paid to do nothing.  There have been occasions where Mr Cooke has made sarcastic comments about work being done slow or messy we take pride in our work but it s a disappointment when there is no faith in us.  Majority off the staff feels like this and want something being done. Preferably a transfer of manager or them to be demoted so the status doesn’t make them into hitler.   They yearly feed back is never anonymous as they sit there watching us what we write. The staff turnover is increasing for a reason.;;;;;2016-05-21T17:24:24+0000;1463851464;2016-05-21 19:24:24;0;17;0;0;17;16;9;7;28;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

At the bottom of the label  in the smallest print  it states  farmed in Turkey  but more clearly  in larger print it claims  packed in U.K.  Clearly there is no packaging on the fish that are laid out on a bed of ice and I m guessing they weren t sent over from Turkey live in a vat of sea water and would have been in packaging to prevent contamination  hence  unpacked in the U.K.  would be more correct.

My husband went out to ask him not to try to turn his lorry because he hits the pots & he outright denied it :O my husband told him I d taken photographs & he turned round & said  you can t do anything about it unless you have a photograph of my face! :O what kind of attitude is that?

I cant say that I think very much of a super market that does not remove John West tuna tins knowing that the sale of these is not a sustainable practice!  John West catch their tuna and everything else that is precious in the ocean with their destructive fishing methods.  There wont be anything left in the sea... so you will not make a profit then!!

I have my shopping delivered each week and have generally been very happy with the service we ve received. I arranged for my husband to collect our shopping this evening from your Solihull store. It was an extra special shop as contained all the food for our son s Christening on Sunday. It was really easy to collect and only some bread rolls were substituted. It was only when he got home and we unloaded the shopping (it was in bags tonight  usually we have no bags for home delivery) that we realised a lot of items have use by dates for tomorrow and others for Sunday! I ve had to freeze all the rolls as they re BB date is tomorrow and although I know this is just a guide  I am conscious that they would most likely be stale. Some things will have to be returned and exchanged tomorrow - the last thing I d want to be doing and the whole reason I d preordered the food!

So I dropped into your Redditch store this evening  having recently converted to Sainsbury s because in our town your fruit and veg selection is of a higher quality than your competitors. I was pleased to grab some Strawberries that had come from Staffordshire.  But then I got to the asparagus.  I was really looking forward to getting hold of some big thick asparagus spears at a good price because of them being in season and being grown only 20 miles south of your store in Evesham.  The BBC website says:  More asparagus is grown in Worcestershire than anywhere else in the UK  and the asparagus from the Vale of Evesham has been considered the best in the world for many years.   But instead I was greeted with a packet of thin-looking spears that had come all the way from Peru. I ve been on Google Maps  Sainsbury s  and it tells me that s around 6 026 miles away from the Redditch store - and that s as the crow flies. Let s not get into the financial and environmental cost of transporting the goods.   How can it be that you can get Strawberries from Staffordshire to your Redditch store when that county is some 60 miles away on the other side of Birmingham  and yet you can t get asparagus into the store when it s only 20 miles south?;;;;;2016-05-19T20:37:45+0000;1463690265;2016-05-19 22:37:45;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ordered 53 pounds worth of items just to be sure I could use it. Now when it is delivered said coupon does not show up!!  So within 5 minutes of the delivery man coming I ring up the number on my receipt to make a complaint.   I do not agree with the charges.   I am told there is NOTHING they can do!  I must have made an error on my end.  Well I certainly use the computer all the time and am fairly certain I DID put in said code but either way I am now stuck having to take this food back to my local Sainsburys to return it on the sheer principal!!!  I would not have ordered the 50 pounds worth without having saved the 10 pounds!!!  It is far better to shop in store if this is the type of service you are offering on delivery!

This evening I picked up some Sainsburys salmon from the shelf  rather than the fish counter and looking at the shelf thought that it was £2.50.  This seemed like a good deal and this influenced my choice of product.  However  at the till this actually rang up as £5.00.  The explanation was that it was two portions of fish each at £2.50.  This seems reasonable  but in that case why is it priced on the shelf at £2.50!  All of the packages seemed to contain 2 pieces of fish.  Technically I am sure that it makes it clear on the shelf that it is per portion and on the packaging itself it says £2.50 on one side and then £5 on the other  but this is misleading and with all the controversy around packaging changes and alterations to weights I feel that it might well be intentional.  You might say this is only £2.50 and it won t break the bank  but none-the-less  I am cross about this.  Please do something about this Sainsburys  you can do better than this.

As a conscientious citizen  I always try to make use of my backpack for my groceries rather than taking a harmful  potentially world ending plastic monstrosity (despite most of my fresh produce being wrapped in plastic too  but I ll save that for another letter).  After selecting from your wares and approaching the checkout  I am usually invited by staff to use the  self checkout  even though in my reality there appears to be no such thing. The fine persons are bewildered by my hesitance  but I am fully aware of the approaching inevitability.  I approach the synthetic human  and am presented with the option...  I have my own bag   which I dutifully select. I am then invited to place said bag(s) upon the weighing contraption  which I again dutifully complete and tell the synthetic human I am finished.  My ears are then filled with those piercing words...  please wait while we verify your bags . And I do. The real humans are busy serving other customers  refilling the shelves with fine wares  or collaborating and deliberating on who in Britain really does have talent. The synthetic human is patiently waiting for some form of consent from their human masters to proceed. My fellow customers appear to look upon me with some malcontent  for they too are awaiting the purchase of goods such that they may return to their loved ones and prepare sustenance.  Eventually a real human appears and I can continue with my purchase  until such time as an  unexpected item  appears in the bagging area  despite this item being the bag which I tried so hard to introduce to the synthetic mere moments ago.  In summary  please  for the sake of all humanity  change the setting and allow our own bags to be automatically authorised by our faithful synthetic humans.  Thanking you in anticipation;;;;;2016-05-19T18:04:02+0000;1463681042;2016-05-19 20:04:02;3;8;4;0;12;8;6;2;2;0;3;0;0;1;0;0;0

Dear Mr Coupe I write to you as a concerned and regular customer of Sainsburys near Richmond. I am aware that most slaughterhouses in the UK have now installed CCTV cameras due to concerns about the appalling treatment of animals therein. However  to my horror I have recently learned that 33 businesses in the UK and Wales ( a fifth of all those with CCTV) have refused to share the information provided with the FSA. It is not publicly known which slaughterhouses have refused to share such footage  In my view this is totally unacceptable behaviour. As you are probably aware efforts are now being made for CCTV to be made mandatory in all slaughterhouses and legislation passed to ensure that footage is available to official vets.   In the meantime I am aware that all leading supermarkets require slaughterhouses to have CCTV. However it is unclear whether supermarkets  including Sainsburys  ensure that the  footage from these slaughterhouses is firstly available and secondly is independently monitored.  Thank you in anticipation for your response;;;;;2016-05-19T15:38:42+0000;1463672322;2016-05-19 17:38:42;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am compelled to write as I wish to complain about my visit to the Sainsbury’s Heaton  Newcastle Superstore earlier this morning. First let me take you back to the sunny evening of the 6th May. I called in to the petrol station to fill up  went to pay the £46.19 with my debit card but unfortunately there seemed to be a problem as the card terminal was saying ‘Timed Out’  we tried a few more times and then on a different till but to no avail. The gentleman apologised profusely and explained that his colleague was on the phone to IT. I had to then go back over to the main store and withdraw cash in order to pay for my fuel. A bit of a pain in the ass but needs must and these things happen.  I now bring you back to current day  I noticed that my account was rather depleted with no reasonable explanation as to why. I logged on to online banking and noticed that the fuel payments which we had attempted back on the 6th had come out…..not once…not twice…..not three times…..but FIVE times! So thats £230.95 on fuel in 5 separate transactions!  So I head down to customer services armed with my bank statement hoping this would be resolved quickly and we could all then get on with our lives.  My first contact is with a lady who listened to my story and looked at my bank statement  no apology. She shouted over to her colleague who came over and I told him the sorry tale. No apology  I was told he would have to speak to his manager. He came back but again no apology or explanation as to what was going on and just barked “bank card” at me and then had the ordacity to pull a face! He made me feel as though this was my fault and I’ve never felt so uncomfortable. He then stated that as ‘Good Will’ they will give me back £184.76  Good Will?? Is he moonlighting as Robin Hood or something?  You took £230.95 which was not yours and you are giving me SOME of my own money back as ‘Good Will’? He then said that I couldn’t prove that I paid for the petrol with the £50 cash I withdrew so I wasn’t going to get the last £46.19.  I certainly didn’t rock up at the petrol station with an additional 4 jerry cans and fill them up to exactly £46.19 each because I was paranoid that if we did leave the EU and World War 3 started  it would cause some sort of oil crisis in the Middle East.  Surely some sort of investigation needs to be carried out as I was not the only person who had ‘failed’ card transactions that day and had to go to the cashpoint. Surely the tills couldn’t be closed off due to a mismatch?  I am grateful that I have £184.76 back  although it still hasn’t arrived in my account. I do wish to have this investigated as I believe that all of this can be proved and that you will refund me the last £46.19.;;;;;2016-05-19T14:44:12+0000;1463669052;2016-05-19 16:44:12;9;21;11;6;38;19;12;7;32;0;9;0;2;0;0;0;0

I had coupons from Caring Everyday- partners with Johnson and Johnson  John West and Pringles through their official Facebook page and your staff were rude and accusing. They were obviously poorly trained as I had to ask the girl on the till to scan them as she didn t know what she was doing- and of course they were expected by your tills. My grandmother was asked to go to customer services where she was asked where she got the coupons and when I explained it was through the manufacturers I was made to feel a fraud  embarrassed and a liar with more clueless staff being called over to add to the confusion over something very simple. WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I ve been shopping there for around ten years but I will not be shopping at your stores again  disgraceful behaviour leaving my elderly grandmother very upset.

I have had several TU items delivered to my local store (Bexhill  East Sussex) over the past few months  and its never been a pleasant experience when I collect/return. There are very few customer service staff who actually know what to do when I say I m collecting an order  so I nearly always have to wait for someone to come. It then takes an age for them to fiddle on the computer finding my order (because they re not really sure what they re doing)  and then I have to wait for forever while they go upstairs to fetch it. Its a very similar experience when returning an order. I usually have to allow 15mins for this process. The staff  while polite  are be no means friendly. I usually feel that I m causing a great inconvenience to them by having my order delivered to store and as such never feel welcome.   This mornings experience is what has compelled me to write something. I was returning an item of clothing - never worn  in original packing and with the paper order slip. The woman on the desk almost wouldn t accept it because I didn t have the blue outer packaging  which is essentially  just the carrier bag. I had to argue my case and she would only process the return with supervisor approval. Ok  I got my refund  but not without a fight.   I have to say  none of this makes me want to really order from you any more  and I won t pay postage to have it delivered to my house. I m not really expecting any follow up  just wanted you to know that Bexhill Sainsbuys are rubbish!   Kind Regards;;;;;2016-05-19T11:23:49+0000;1463657029;2016-05-19 13:23:49;1;8;1;0;9;8;2;6;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

She was worried that we would lose the trolley so I assured her it was fine and kept regulary saving it  and in turn  it assured us that even if we come away from the computer it was saved.   She wants to add to the order throughout the week and checkout on sunday. Again I promised her that she could do that.  She was fretting so I said  lets log out and I ll show you the trolley is still there . The website even said goodbye  assured us it was saved and we could finish our order any time.    I logged back in  lo and behold...empty trolley! Zero! Nothing!   Well  that made me look like a right numpty.   Complete waste of our time and one stressed mother! Needless to say  any online shops we do  will be with Tescos now  I am not wasting my time like that again.;;;;;2016-05-18T20:20:21+0000;1463602821;2016-05-18 22:20:21;1;10;1;0;11;10;5;5;6;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have been a loyal customer there since it opened and have been a loyal customer of Sainsbury s for a long time. Whilst reaching for a tub of powdered milk for my baby daughter  the aisle sign fell down smacking me and my 4 year old son who was in my arms in the face. The pain was excruciating and my son screamed the place down. It could have quite easily broken his nose. I was disgusted that not one member of staff came to our aid to see if we were ok and when I told the lady that served me  she simply said  oh sorry about that . I could not believe the complete lack of concern and indeed customer service. I would like to know how this is going to be addressed and indeed how I will be compensated.;;;;;2016-05-18T16:56:11+0000;1463590571;2016-05-18 18:56:11;0;10;0;0;10;10;6;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

In light of this  they must insist that the brands they stock  like John West  stop using destructive fishing methods such as Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs).  It’s great that Sainsbury’s own brand tuna is 100% pole & line caught  but why then do they stock tuna caught using unsustainable methods?  In the last 2 weeks  Tesco and Waitrose said they could drop John West if they don’t reach high sustainability standards and renounce this destructive fishing method.

I purchase all of my shopping from Sainsbury s  at Chafford Hundred  Thurrock  with deliveries taking place twice most weeks. Most of the delivery crew are lovely  polite  kind and always baring a smile. However  in the past few weeks  I have had one called Julia  who is nothing more than a thug. She approaches my door like a hitman  deliberately pulling up her sleeves to display the huge tattoos on her generous biceps. She talks to the customer like she s a 13-year-old chav who s sole purpose is to make the residents of the street they re on suffer. You know the ones  the ones who proudly boast about their ASBOS like it s a university doctorate? Well  anyway  that’s the only way to describe the behaviour of this Julia Pritchard character. I digress. Back to my complaint  I am a woman of almost 40 years  with a daughter that approaches 20 in a few short weeks. Unfortunately  due health complications  I can’t always be the person to greet the driver and receive my groceries  but my daughter never fails to open the door with the manners that have been instilled in her since birth. Julio came a couple of weeks back and got irate with my daughter because in her own words ‘she looks under 25’. Well  I should hope so  seeing as she’s net met her second decade yet. My daughter pointed out that she never get’s Id’d by any of the other drivers  and seeing as there is never alcohol or other restricted items and that the house was clearly undergoing major constructions  asked was it really necessary. Julio argued her point  and my daughter gracefully relented. There were a couple of substitutions on the list so my daughter called out to me to ask if they were suitable. Upon hearing my voice  Julio  took great offence and told me to “get up and sign for my own shopping!” Now  after paying for a service  and having my adult daughter present to sign for the groceries  do you think that was appropriate? For all she knew  I could’ve been laid up with a full body cast! Anyway  my daughter expressed her displeasure at her blatant disrespect for her mother to which the delivery girl responded with shouting and swearing  and a whole lot of stepping up into my daughters space in order to look down upon her. I  of course telephoned head office to complain  and was assured that they didn’t want to lose a customer and that I wouldn’t have to lay eyes upon her again… Having caught you up to speed  this brings us to this morning. A rapturous knocking on my front door sent my little dog into a frenzy  so I instructed my daughter to remove him so that the delivery person wouldn’t be exposed to any threat. Once it was in hand  I opened the door with the same smile I use to greet everyone. The first thing that struck me was the offensive stance of this woman. And the second was that she seemed unprepared to see me standing there. After recovering from her shock  she groused  in a most unpleasant manner  “Oh  are you signing for the shopping this week?” Odd  no? I responded  nonetheless. “Yes.” She regarded me for a moment before hitting me with the most ridiculous request. “I need ID…” I laughed  and asked  “Are you serious?” “Yeah!” was her gruff response. Of course  this only served to aggravate me  as anyone and their blind grandma can see that I’m over 25 –four decades  remember?– Anyhow  I told her that I certainly will not be producing identification  that I’m almost 40 years old  and that the ID she saw only recently was that of my adult daughter. She made a flip remark under her breath  to which I reminded her  this happened a couple of weeks ago with her. She responded with a wolfish grin  “You don’t want your shopping  then?” I do not negotiate with those who try to terrorise me. So I asked her why she was here  I was assured by head office that I wouldn’t have to deal with her unpleasantness again. My weekly grocery bill alone is probably more than she gets paid. Anyway  with that  she threw my paperwork at me  told me to “Shop at Asda ” and walked away with my groceries still on her van. Now  I wish to point out that I have been using Sainsbury’s online shopping for in excess of a year now  and have only ever had two complaints. Both times it has been with her. I don’t know her or anything about her  so why would I have any problem with her? I ask you  would you put up with being treated this way in your own home? I have been up to the store AND have called the online delivery helpline to complain about this matter. I am posting this because I want something done about this menacing woman. If she’s treating me like this  then I’m sure she’s the same way with other innocent service users. My biggest fear is that she may be doing this to the more vulnerable members of society  the elderly  for example  especially those who are too afraid to speak out for fear of reprisal.  Please feel free to share this post  especially if you’ve found yourself the victim of a power mad delivery boy. You do not have to tolerate bullying  regardless of what these bullies say. Empower the weak. Empower yourself.;;;;;2016-05-16T13:05:26+0000;1463403926;2016-05-16 15:05:26;4;6;4;0;10;6;3;3;3;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Are you also going to give the artist lucky enough to be chosen a lifetime supply of free groceries  or do you  like them  need to actually earn a living from your business? By your standards  can I walk in to your stores and take a trolleyful of goods and walk out with them  as long as they are wrapped in your 5p a pop carrier bags  emblazoned with your logo  thus gaining you exposure? I wouldn t even try  because I appreciate that  as a business  you have plenty of overheads that need paying  and a little left over at the end of each month (or  as is probably your case  more than I will earn in a lifetime) can help to grow your business. Please do not ask for free labour. ALL your staff should be paid. That is what we  as customers  expect you to do when we hand over our hard earned cash. If you are truly struggling  as some of us are  then I am sure there are some pen twiddlers in an office somewhere who won t mind working for free for a few hours in order to pay for an artist to create the space they want. You could even name the room after them  gaining them exposure and as gratitude for their work? After all  a plaque with their name on will feed their family just as well as the cash  won t it?;;;;;2016-05-16T08:51:27+0000;1463388687;2016-05-16 10:51:27;3;0;3;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

Apologise  without reservation  for this bungling error. 2. Thank those who have pointed out to you that it was a bungling error. 3. Commission an artist  using an appropriate selection process  to redecorate your canteen. 4. Remunerate the artist with a thumping good fee. 5. Put photographs of the canteen on your Facebook page. 6. Re 5 above - do not ask a photographer to produce the photos for no fee in return for exposure.  This advice is given for free.  Thank you for the exposure.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like help in managing the process.

I went shopping in your Eastleigh shop(next to the bus station and in the town centre).  I was very unhappy with a member of staff.  As I approached the lifts at the top of the carpark the children decided to race me to the bottom as I waited for the lift by using the stairs. You had an employee with trolleys waiting for the lift.  As I waited he was very visibly shacking his head. The lift arrived and I put my hand in front of the door. Your employee was still annoyed at me  so I said to him  there is enough room in here if you want to come in?  he shook his head and told me that  Its fine  you go ahead. I know my place.  I was shocked and said  Sorry?  there is room in here for you too  He then told me  You are obviously more important then me!  He was very aggressive and it made me very annoyed and upset.  I went straight to customer service and made a complaint. The chap there was very pleasant and told me that the guy is  special . He was referring to the fact that the guy upstairs has learning difficulties I think. I was also told that sometimes he doesn t necessarily know what he is saying.  I met up with my wife who had arranged to meet myself and the kids and I explained to her  and she told me that the same guy on a previous visit had rammed her with trollies as she waited for a lift.  As I did my shopping and came back round  I saw the  special  guy speaking to security and the man I spoke to at customer service.  When I went back to the car  he was at the top again just staring at me.  I understand that you are an equal opportunities employer and that any member of the public would allow for people with learning issues and I would do exactly the same  but your employee made me very upset.  I think you should really look at whether this is the place for this guy in particular. Your other employee made it clear to me that I am not the first to complain about him and within our immediate family he has upset myself and my wife.  I would really think about returning to that store.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Camden Sainsbury s were asking an artist to come forward and paint their staff canteen for free.  Let me ask you this  would you ask an electrician to re-wire for free?  Or ask a carpet layer to do it for free? So what makes you think an artist should give up their time  their materials  their training and their expert creativity and talent - for free? Artists pay bills too  we (yes I am an artist) have the same living costs as the rest of the population.  Another point I found insulting was  you say painting your staff canteen will enhance our reputation ... but it s a closed canteen  for your staff members.  it s not an open gallery where anyone can walk in and view.  It enhances nothing but the walls.   Please respect that an artist works for a living and is often tortured mentally so expecting a freebie was very  very insulting.

My husband then went in  to be asked the same as me can he not just use over the counter until Monday which I had already said many time does not work! Then for him to be told do you have a phone because this will take hours (I know it does not!) he said yes and that s fine!..

I felt quite upset after leaving. The cafe was quite busy and the staff were really doing an excellent job. They were some delays with the food coming out  however I think this was due to the demand alone and definitely not due to the staff who were working so very hard. This led to some frustration with some customers and this was directed at the staff. I witnessed this and the young girl who was working the till dealt with it in an amazing manner  she was so polite and professional. However she was clearly upset by the conversation (and quite rightly so) and I really felt for her. They staff must surely feel so demoralised after working in such conditions and it is very unfair. I wanted to post this on here as I am hoping for 2 things. 1. For this to be recognised and for the staff to perhaps be given some more support at what is bound to be a busy period. 2. For the staff to know that they are very much appreciated and undeserving of such criticism.  Could you please feed this back to the Biggleswade store?  Many thanks  Jane;;;;;2016-05-14T12:57:03+0000;1463230623;2016-05-14 14:57:03;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

We had a lovely day looking at  and interacting with  the animals there. On the way home we stopped off at our local Sainsburys store to pick up some groceries. One of the things we bought was an 800g loaf of Giraffe Bread. However  despite the name  imagine my son s disappointment upon returning home and tearing into the bread  only to find it contained no giraffes. Not even one. Not even a little one. Understandably he felt cheated and betrayed by the Sainsburys brand and was all for vowing never to spend his money in Sainsburys again  instead planning on saving up for a loaf of Tiger bread from Asda  as he likes tigers almost as much as he likes giraffes. I reassured him that I would write to you and urge you to put warning stickers on the loaves so that other children do not fall foul of this fair trading faux pas. What next... chicken curry without the chicken? Belgian buns with no Belgians in? What stunt are you trying to pull here  Sainsburys  tricking little kids out of their pocket money?;;;;;2016-05-13T16:03:32+0000;1463155412;2016-05-13 18:03:32;5;11;6;1;18;7;7;0;0;0;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

You think this will be a great opportunity for the artist (to produce art for you for no money) and to be recognised in the local area.  What a great idea! I ve therefore suggested to all my Facebook friends that they do the following:  Everyone should pop into your local Sainsbury s tomorrow lunchtime  and help yourselves to some nice goods off the shelves  perhaps a nice warm pastie  or a tasty sandwich. On your way out  without going near any tills  take a note to the customer services desk on which you have written   In order to help you get your goods recognised in the local area  I am going to sit on a bench outside  eating your lovely product. I will tell anyone passing how delicious this product is  thus enhancing your reputation in the area. This unique opportunity to get your work recognised will cost you nothing and will enable you to leave your mark on this community. There s no need to thank me. Good afternoon.  And then walk out.

I was made to feel like a naughty little girl doing something I shouldn t be. I m a married woman with 4 children  my daughter will be old enough to buy them in a few years and yet I m still asked. I know the law says you have to be 16 to buy them  and I know your policy is to ask if anyone looks under 25 but again I am obviously not under 16 and they way I was spoken today made me feel like a child in front of a queue full of people.

I just called into the supermarket cafe with my 3-year-old and brand new baby. We had registered his birth and to celebrate my toddler wanted lunch at the supermarket - he thinks that s a huge treat.  We ordered our food  at which point I realised I had brought my husband s card and not mine  so I didn t know the PIN. It was very embarrassing but I had to ask them to hold our food back while I drove home for my purse. My 3 year old was upset and my baby was fussing for a feed - so it was quite stressful! Then a man (unaccountably dressed as Danger Mouse) stepped in  introduced himself as the manager and said he had children himself and there would be no charge for our meal.   We re regular Sainsbury s customers anyway  but this kind of compassionate response to a flustered mum with a newborn just shows what a good shop it is.

I d like to report one of your delivery drivers for dangerous driving. The gentleman spent the entirety of a two-three mile long  50mph speed-limit road around two metres distance from the rear of my vehicle  used incorrect lanes to attempt to hop a moving traffic que at traffic lights  and indicated that he wanted to re-enter the correct lane in a dangerous manner. Unable to do so  he then held up traffic in the wrong lane whilst waiting for an opportunity to return  and then returned to driving within 2 metres of my vehicle whilst I patiently waited for a cyclist to reach an appropriate point at which I could pass safely. The number plate of the van was PK56 SYS  and the driver appeared to be an older gentlemen of around 45-60 years of age.  Please keep me informed as to what your company is prepared to do in this instance  as I felt I was pressured to exceed the speed limit (something I did not do)  and feared there could be a crash. I find it astounding that somebody who drives for a living could do so in such an unsafe and aggressive manner.;;;;;2016-05-12T19:25:10+0000;1463081110;2016-05-12 21:25:10;0;13;2;0;15;12;3;9;10;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

I purchased it specifically due to Garnier using Mexoryl® SX which is an exceptionally photostable sun filter. Before putting it on  looking at the ingredients  there is no Mexoryl but Avobenzone which is very photo unstable. I then looked at the date of manufacture and saw that it is 22H103 which is January 2011 - which probably is why no Mexoryl and which is way past the 36 month shelf life recommended by Garnier. This is really dangerous for an SPF product. Please can you advise? Thank you;;;;;2016-05-12T15:00:30+0000;1463065230;2016-05-12 17:00:30;0;10;0;0;10;3;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

As a mother with several kids  I find these multibuys invaluable to spread the weekly shopping budget and a large amount of my shopping trolley is items on offers or multibuys. I am really disappointed if it s true that you are withdrawing them. Also I tend to buy a lot of your Basics range to make our money go further  however over the last year I have been really disappointed to see quite a number of Basics items disappearing from the shelves - 12 pack of snack crisps was one which was really handy for the kids packed lunches and there are many more that have just gone that were really useful. Also many of these Basics items are no longer as good value for money as they used to be as the price keeps sliding upwards. (eg the bakery section morning goods - the basics crumpets  scotch pancakes and muffins used to be very cheap and now they are not! I also noticed last week that the multipack of basics sausage rolls suddenly shrank from an 8 pack to 6 and the price remains the same! I don t really think that is on! An 8 pack was a better size for our family too. I am really disappointed and would like Sainsbury s to consider expanding their Basics range back again and lowering the prices so the Basics range has more budget prices  not just only a small bit cheaper than the normal ones!;;;;;2016-05-12T14:01:05+0000;1463061665;2016-05-12 16:01:05;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I had to go in to take some bits back for Click & Collect.  However there was another customer giving them hell about Maris Piper potatoes. From what I could work out  the fresh produce lad has brought out every last bag of MP potatoes and none was good enough for Mrs high almighty. The customer service staff had put various calls out- but nothing was good enough. How the staff kept their cool I ll never know but she was rude and disrespectful and even interrupted my transaction with the staff member. In the end the manager was called at her request- from what I could see she was getting very animated and irate with the manager. The staff were clearly upset  but kept their professionalism at all times  they are a credit to you. I d have told her to leave the branch. They can t select what arrives in branch- not do they have control over what s grown!!

There was no confirmation (after ten attempts) and with every box filled..... so here it is:-   To start with  I am talking about the Barkingside store off the High Street  NOT the Newbury Park  store (I don’t have a car  I never shop there).  WHY does not the Barkingside store stock your Black Seedless Grapes (from South Africa) any longer?  I AM A regular buyer of your seedless Black grapes  not just for me but also for a relative who is currently in hospital (they always sell out by about Noon each day  so they are clearly very popular).   According to the (very helpful) Assistant I spoke to today (Wednesday 11 th May)  he said it was the Manager’s decision not to stock this line any longer. WHY?? I( suspect you were trying to get us to buying the Seedless Red grapes. P{lease note: compared to the Black grapes  the Red ones are rubbish.  Furthermore  the Assistant also mentioned that I was the Third person to have asked him about the Black Grapes. [Ask yourself this: does this strike you as an unpopular line???]. The manager at Barkingside clearly needs to know what sells in his store. [[It is clear to me that he is not fit for purpose]]  I’m not even sure why I am sending this  nobody listens to the customer any longer  least of all the manager of the Barkingside branch (no wonder we do our shopping at Lidl and Aldi now). I despair of Sainsbury (and I shall shortly be an Ex-Customer of Sainsbury).;;;;;2016-05-11T22:47:28+0000;1463006848;2016-05-12 00:47:28;0;3;0;0;3;3;3;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Having been given one of your Hoovers as an Xmas present last year  it suddenly packed up mid hoover yesterday and no amount of intervention and fuse swapping would fix it. A nightmare more than normal  as I have an open house on Saturday to try and sell my property! I duly phoned the laughably named Electrical Support Team  who appear to be just another version of customer service  offering no advice and refusing to help without a proof of purchase. No receipt available... Arghhh!  I went to the store  with the person who purchased it today  to see if they would be able to trace it back using the SKU and her card number  but without hesitance or quibble  she simply exchanged it and even kept the replacement in its large box behind the counter until we had finished shopping. She was polite  smiley and more than willing to do that bit extra for her customers - a true example of what you expect from a Customer Service colleague.  My faith was restored after an extremely unhelpful and frustrating interaction with the  electrical support team   Y A happy customer  now  with a fully operational hoover  (operator details: S00556 / C1015);;;;;2016-05-11T19:52:20+0000;1462996340;2016-05-11 21:52:20;3;1;3;0;4;1;1;0;1;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

About an hour ago I drove off from the petrol pump leaving my wallet on the roof of my car and your staff at the petrol station and store were absolute lifesavers!!!!  Please can you acknowledge them for there excellent customer service and just for simply being amazing people!!!  They went above and beyond to help me when I returned to the petrol station distraught that I had lost my wallet with £500 of euros in it (all my savings) and my driving licence and my bank cards etc when I am due to leave on the ferry tomorrow for my holiday to Belgium. My holiday would have been ruined and I would not only have lost all that money but also I would have been unable to go at all without my driving licence and bank card.   I was utterly gutted and in pieces and when i explained the situation to the staff in the petrol station (I believe there names were Jane and Natasha  sorry if I have got them wrong as I was in a bit of a state) they went far above and beyond there job to help me.  Natasha checked the Cctv with Jane and they found my car leaving and we could see the wallet on the roof as I drove out so Jane came out with me up and down the road searching the bushes and roundabout for my wallet.   Meanwhile Natasha phoned the main store to see if they had it handed in. Well when myself and Jane returned empty handed I was totally a mess as we couldn t find it and was met by Natasha at the petrol station who was smiling and said good news  it had been handed in at the main store.  I simply broke down as I was sure my holiday (the first one I could afford in 3 years) was ruined and these lady s at the petrol station and the customer service team in the main store and the amazing people whoever they were that had handed it in all deserve medals!  They went out of there way to help and care and they really are great people so please can you give them any kind of award on my behalf as without these people I just don t know what I would have done. They are stars and you should be proud and honoured to have such super people working for you and shopping with you it shows your really have the best staff and customers!  I thank them and your customer who handed it in from the bottom of my heart. There are some great people in this world and you have some great customers and fantastic staff.

I tried to get a spot in the child and parent spaces near the front but none were available  I managed to park just opposite the spaces (for reference of where the problem is). My car was therefore near the front  i didnt spot the pot holes on the way in as its not my usual store.    The road is terrible  very large holes all over the place and unavoidable with a trolly as u try and miss one but hit another. It was very rainy today and my trolly went right into a deep hole! My 17 month old  3 year old and myself received such a jolt!   The trolly was stuck with both wheels in the hole in the blasted road!  Not only did we all get a shock but iv now pulled my back (sacroiliac injury now hurting again) from trying to haul the thing out the pot hole. If my kids were hurt id be absolutely livid. Sort out your carpark sainsburys before someone really hurts themselves.

On Sunday  8th may I was at my local store in leigh and after finishing my shop I went to pay on my card where I was informed (after the 1st attempt) there was a problem and the card was declined. The problem being in store  staff was trying to get the card to work on different tills where I was informed it was happening to others aswell. Not bothered at all at what happened I left the store happy. Monday morning I went to the bank and had the shock of my life (monday morning still half asleep) when funds had gone. After a conversation with my bank I found out I had been charged 5 times for the Sunday shop. I phoned the local store and was put through to the department manager and in the conversation he assured me that they where aware of the problem as it wasn t a isolated incident and promised us our money would be back with us by the end of Monday. Happy with this promise and still finding the funny side we left the issue alone and continued our day. Later Monday afternoon the manager phoned us back saying IT was aware and again assured us the money will be in our bank that day. Tuesday may 10th (our rent day) the funds not returned landlord charge for late rent bank charges for bounced standing order. Not happy at all. Phoned the store again and was put to a different manager as the man I spoke with yesterday was of (no issues with that everyone deserves days off) after explaining everything to him he apologized and gave me the customer service phone number as they will help.....  So I phone CUSTOMER SERVICES. wow after fully explaining what had happened  I was replied  sorry we know what happened you ll be paid back in 5working days  I explained again what happened and due to a failed promise from management (that we put our trust in) we had incurred charges was no longer happy with this and would like to speak to a CUSTOMER SERVICE manager replied  I ve said what will happen and no   after confirming the reply mainly the being told no to speaking to a manager the woman on the phone just said  no  a hung the phone up! What. This is your customer service? Management can make false promises regardless and very rude customer service  not a happy customer at all.;;;;;2016-05-10T16:26:57+0000;1462897617;2016-05-10 18:26:57;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

However  I feel rather as though the Sainsbury s empire has let the thousands upon thousands of coeliacs in the UK down this week.   From 9th - 15th May this year  it is Coeliac Awareness Week. It is an incurable autoimmune condition that affects an estimated 1 in 100 people in the UK. For one week every year  the major supermarkets typically reduce the cost of gluten free items (which  as you know  are already up to five times the price of their non-gluten free counterparts)  giving coeliacs and others who avoid gluten  a chance to stock up on items for a slightly lower price.   However  I notice that this year  while Tesco offers 3-for-2 on their entire free from range  Asda has  rolled back  the price of gluten free times and Morrisons has created a range of offers across their gluten free items  Sainsbury s has declined to participate. It feels a little like a slap in the face for your coeliac customers  who have enthusiastically purchased from your generally wide range of gluten free items. Instead of feeling looked after and having our custom appreciated  we are left feeling that our custom is better appreciated by competing supermarkets.   This evening  I will be going to my local Tesco  where I will be stocking up on various gluten free items. Items I would have preferred to buy from my preferred supermarket. I can only hope that you will make the effort next year.   Disappointedly    Vikki Cook;;;;;2016-05-10T14:00:59+0000;1462888859;2016-05-10 16:00:59;0;3;0;1;4;3;1;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

After walking around the store for an hour or so  hubby was finished so went to checkout. He loaded it all up  the lady put it through and then the machines stopped working. She tried to put it through twice but decided it had failed and asked him to leave as they were closing. It was 4pm. Apparently the cash machines were out of order too. So he left with no shopping at 4pm on Sunday   he drove around for some time and found a tesco express shop open. He got a few items but because of my health barely anything as I need wholefoods and organic. We realised that the payment had infact gone through today and popped back in expecting an apology and a refund. Instead served by the same lady again  she sent him away with no refund or way of apology. She told him that it s his problem now.  The bank will apparently be able to refund him. I am sat outside the bank now  have been for twenty minutes already. We love sainsburys choice and range but have been left really upset by the treatment within the store  no word of apology for hours of wasted time and money that we simply did not have spare.  I am really disappointed 😞;;;;;2016-05-10T12:07:32+0000;1462882052;2016-05-10 14:07:32;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have spent a half hour on the phone (most of which on hold) and all they said can do for me is fill the order NEXT WEEK. Not acceptable. I need it today  which is why I ordered it so that it would be delivered today. I have also been promised a phone call which has not yet come. I will not be shopping with you all anymore. A complete disappointment on all points  you guys should not commit to bulk orders if you can t fill them. Shame on you Sainsbury s on how this was handled  no accountability and no concern shown thus far.

I ordered sausage and mash for myself and my toddler. When it came the  sausage  in the children s meal was clearly of very inferior quality and when I tasted it (luckily my son chose to spit it out) was frankly disgusting. I wouldn t feed something like that to my dog. I was told that children s meals come ready made while adult meals are made on the premises.  The ingredients list for the children s sausage showed they contain only 18% meat. This is legally not a sausage which must be 42% meat. I will be contacting trading standards about this. I am horrified that sainsburys consider children unworthy of the same standard of food as adults  and that they would serve something which is clearly not as described.  Fair warning to sainsburys customers.... Don t feed your children from the  children s menu  unless you want them to eat slops!;;;;;2016-05-10T07:06:59+0000;1462864019;2016-05-10 09:06:59;6;10;6;3;19;10;2;8;1;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;0

I therefore asked the manager on duty if I could leave my trolley for about 10 mins whilst I pop out to feed my son. She not only said yes to that but offered to put everything through the till for me and pack it all away in my bags so all I had to do was come back into store and pay at customer services and my shopping was all there neatly packed away in my bags ready for me to collect.

Yesterday my card was declined twice so I paid cash only to find two pending transactions from them on my bank account. I phoned my bank and they told me if Sainsbury s sent a fax the money could be released. Sainsbury s refused to do this and said the money would be returned but I explained because of their error I would now incur bank charges because I now don t have the funds to cover my direct debits. Sainsbury s weren t interested. Worst customer service ever!!!;;;;;2016-05-09T15:49:45+0000;1462808985;2016-05-09 17:49:45;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

It was one of the best ones I have ever bought. The house smelled divine. I decided that for a treat I would buy myself another one. I looked on the bottle that came with it to see the fragrance  but there wasn t anything on it to identify the smell. Everything needed to identify it was in the packaging that went in the bin some time ago! This is just a suggestion  maybe you could put a little sticker on the bottom of the bottles  so that if people like me want to buy another one  we can see what the fragrance was called.

I wish to complain about all the moaners on your page who moan about LITERALLY NOTHING and seem to have all the time in the world to moan. Although some are pure hilarious my heart sometimes goes out to those in customer care who must be constantly in pain with laughter at all the minuscule and trivial bs that people put up in your page. Some of these moaners have obviously no proper life lessons and hence the sad state of our world today. Rant over.

Put my card and pin details in to be told this was declined. This happened twice which I could not understand as there was enough funds in. I received 2 receipts to say this had been declined and decided paying by credit card.   I then decided to call my bank whilst still in the store as I knew something wasn t right. I spoke to my bank who confirmed that both transactions had been authorised and gave me authorisation codes. He explained that the money was being reserved for sainsburys now and there was only 2 ways to resolve. I could either wait the 7 days until the money was returned back to my account or sainsburys could simply send a fax confirming they were not claiming the money and it would be back in my account with 24-48hours. As this was not my fault and was put through twice I obviously wanted the 2nd option. After speaking to 2 store colleagues both me and the gentleman at the bank were told that that this is not something sainsburys can do?! It became apparent that the store was having a few issues as time went on as more customers cards were being declined. In the end they had formed quite a queue and there was nothing they could do for me. So now I have to wait 7 days for 2 lots of money to be returned to me. Not great service at all. And with all the technology I find it hard to believe that this could not have been resolved.   Luckily I had checked with my bank but how many other people are gonna have their money taken and have to wait this long to have it returned..

After some calculations I realised that both times the card was declined the money left my account. I left Sainsbury s £120 poorer and with no shopping.

When it opened my husband spoke to the store manager about putting up posters advertising our charity events  the store manager said not a problem and to just pop them on the board which we ve been doing for nearly a year now. The other day when he was doing it my husband was made to feel like a criminal by the store security and customer services and then to add insult to injury I go in a few days later and they have taken his poster down. When asked why they said they can t advertise it - despite the board being covered in other local charity events!  All the other sainsburies  tesco  morrisons and Costa support us but not our local store! So I certainly shan t bother to support them by shopping their- I will walk to morrisons or tesco instead!!!;;;;;2016-05-08T06:39:52+0000;1462689592;2016-05-08 08:39:52;0;6;0;0;6;6;1;5;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

As i was queing up to pay i noticed a shopping basket full of ripe browning bananas. I asked the assistant on the till if they are reduced and she said that they were not for sale and need to be thrown away. I was totaly shocked they were just a little brown  the colour bananas go when they are ripe. I asked if i could purchase some as would have been perfect for cooking and lovely and sweet to eat. Again she was adamant that they were not allowed to be sold as they were no good.  I was totally shocked that they were going to go straight into the bin. As i was leaving the assistant said to another girl working were going have to move them which had given me the impression i hadnt been the first person to ask about them. Which means therr coyld have bern some happy customers and sales through the till. I know stores like asda bag them up and sell them for 10-20p a bag. As your company is so commited at getting thier customers to reduce thier own food waste i would have though you would have been commited too. There are even plenty of charities or homeless shelters im sure theses could have helped or neen used to create something else. Im really disappointed and will think twice before shopping there again.;;;;;2016-05-08T06:20:09+0000;1462688409;2016-05-08 08:20:09;2;3;2;0;5;3;2;1;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Last time i went in he went the extra mile  he gave me tips on how to cook my meat  was lovely to me and my mother and made our shopping experience that much better! I went in today to tell him how my chops came out and yet again he was extremely helpful and really friendly and he deserves to know! 😁 thank you  one happy customer!;;;;;2016-05-06T19:17:39+0000;1462562259;2016-05-06 21:17:39;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was shopping in Sainsbury s Lincoln store today with a very tired / ill  3 yr old.  My husband and I had started shopping. Half a trolley full   we get a call from one of my sons  school. He s not well can we pick him up. 😕  Well  you can imagine the scene. We re about 8 miles from the school  half a trolley of shopping and a screaming  (literally ) 3 yr old. She hadn t stopped since we walked in  wouldn t calm down for anything. We were going past the fresh fruit aisle  struggling with the still screaming 3 yr old & discussing what we would do..... (and still  she s screaming 😔) A member of staff came up to us   said:  excuse me  is she OK?    Me:   yes  just can t stop her crying  Staff:   Would she like a piece of fruit  banana  whilst you re walking around and getting sorted?  Me:  Oh  yes please  thank you   And honestly  she ate that banana and didn t cry again in store. As silly as it may sound  that one act of random kindness from your staff member helped us no end! We were able to pay for the shopping we already had and get out to pick up my son with no more issues. As we were leaving the store we saw him again  he came and asked if she was any better and wished us well with our son. My point with this  is that one small act  of taking a minute to ask if we were okay changed the next few hours for the better. His name is Neville and I d like to thank him for doing that. It s not done as much as it should be in this day and age. So Thank you Neville  your one act of random kindness helped.;;;;;2016-05-06T19:12:57+0000;1462561977;2016-05-06 21:12:57;32;4;35;0;39;4;2;2;5;0;32;2;1;0;0;0;0

I needed 1kg minimum so selected 1 kg pack. All the packs that weighd less than 1kg clearly stated the price per kilo AND the price of the pack. None of the 1kg packs stated the price per kilo. No price for the pack either. Got to the till and the pack came up as £5.50. I queried it. A member of staff went to check and came back with the answer: £4.50 a kilo for small joints of less than a kilo but £5.50 for the medium 1 kilo joints. But it s NOT stated on the packet! As all my shopping was already unloaded onto the belt at the check out and there were customers waiting to be served after me I decided not to go back and choose an alternative joint but paid the £5.50 rather than swap it for the cheaper smaller joint I was offered at the checkout. I should have gone to the customer service desk to complaint but rushed home instead. However  it has occurred to me that  if all the Sainsbury s in Dorset or even nationally are doing the same and lots of customers are tricked into paying £5.50 instead of £4.50 unknowingly for their purchase  that amounts to an awful of extra profit. Was that done on purpose or is it a genuine mistake? Looking forward to an answer from Sainsbury s.;;;;;2016-05-06T12:26:18+0000;1462537578;2016-05-06 14:26:18;0;6;0;1;7;6;1;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Since getting our kittens 7 months ago you never have any kitten food and if you do there is only one variety and it s NEVER on offer.  Our boys love whiskers pouches with gravy and we have managed to buy it once from you. You occasionally have the whiskers fish with jelly but often we complete our shop without our cat food.  Please could you increase the amount of kitten food you stock and occasionally put it on offer like the other cat food. Thanks 🙌🏻;;;;;2016-05-02T17:52:36+0000;1462211556;2016-05-02 19:52:36;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Me and my partner always shop at Sainsburys and have constantly been told to try Morrisons as it is  so much cheaper . So today we decided to give that statement a chance and we went to our local Morrisons. I can quite honestly say it was the biggest mistake we have made this bank holiday - almost every item that we normally buy was at least 40-60p more expensive and we ended up having to get a budget shop in Morrisons for the same amount that we would get a  treat ourselves  shop from Sainsburys. (Also like to add that the 3 for 10 offer on meat in Morrisons is worth half the value you get from meat in Sainsburys... Just saying!) So I d like to apologise for not keeping to our roots and believing other hype.... And I would like to thank you for first of all keeping your prices low and secondly for awarding us with some lovely vouchers when we went into your Ripley store straight after  because we forgot butter 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😀;;;;;2016-05-02T14:30:46+0000;1462199446;2016-05-02 16:30:46;2;1;2;1;4;1;1;0;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I could see she was busy on the bakery section when I asked if they had the Mascarpone Truffle Cake in stock which  I wanted for my daughters birthday   which is displayed on the fresh cream cake display.  She said the last time she checked it was out of stock however she went to double check again to see if it had come during the night delivery. Yes it did and I was so happy as this saved me a trip to the cake shop. Trudy was busy and I believe she deserves to be recognised. Many of your competitors that I have been to always find the easy way out by saying  they don t have it in-stock  however Trudy went out of her way and I really appreciate that. I was served by Adam on the checkout who was friendly. It was quite funny as there was a fishy smell which we tried to work out where it was coming from. All your staff at this store are helpful  bubbly and very friendly. If you ask where something is they will offer to take you there even though they are busy.

Go into store to exchange and there is none left  can t exchange with a Other pair of slippers as till says now only worth £2.20! Which we paid more and are worthless  have to now travel back the 40min journey to find the receipt which wasn t in my bag when I got to the till. Ridicous when it s your mistake for using the wrong hanger misleading us to buying the size we didn t want and cannot change unless we pay more money....not a great shopping experience;;;;;2016-05-01T13:59:15+0000;1462111155;2016-05-01 15:59:15;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Because there is no sign of the price of crude oil going up  or is it the greed that you consumers want more!;;;;;2016-05-01T12:15:28+0000;1462104928;2016-05-01 14:15:28;3;7;3;0;10;7;4;3;2;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

I placed the order to be collected at the Redditch store at 10.30am this morning.  We arrived just after 10.30am to find that the Click and Collect station is just a couple of car park spaces at the back of the car park - no shelter from the elements - next to a space for a van.  As the van was no where to be seen and there were others waiting my husband went into the store to be told that the order was coming from Longbridge!  Were we wrong to think that they would pick the items from the large store in whose car park we were waiting?  The van arrived about 10 minutes later and the driver was apologetic as he d had to fill in at last minute  fine  this happens.   What about your environmental footprint Sainsbury?    What about your customer experience - if it had been lashing down with rain  everything - shopping  driver and customer would have been soaked?    Unbelievably you didn t have a 4pt skimmed milk and had to supply 2 x 2pts and my 18 pack of toilet paper just didn t turn up!    Observations are that if you are trying to get more people to use this service-and I m sure you are otherwise why give vouchers with such an attractive discount-think about how this service is provided.  If you re not picking at the large store where it s collected then don t offer the service there. It s supposed to save time for the customer!!  It s cost me more in time as I had to then go and purchase toilet paper from the store  and frustration levels are high.  NEVER AGAIN!!!;;;;;2016-05-01T10:40:20+0000;1462099220;2016-05-01 12:40:20;2;9;2;1;12;9;2;7;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0
