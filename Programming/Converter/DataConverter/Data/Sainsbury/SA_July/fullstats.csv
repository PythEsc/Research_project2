I was with my partner and children .  We had to witness a member of your staff who was driving one of the delivery vans swearing and arguing to another member of your staff ( who was very clam and didn t swear once ) . He also slammed the back door of the van and drive off erratically at speed. It seemed to be over being asked to take back some rubbish to the main store across the road . He didn t want to for what ever reason . I m very disappointed that my children had to witness this and feel it should be brought to your attention and maybe a word in his ear about self control in public especially when children are around .;;;;;2016-07-31T17:13:22+0000;1469985202;2016-07-31 19:13:22;0;5;0;0;5;5;2;3;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Just sitting in your Frome cafe and went to order the omelette which we wanted with salad as we re both on a diet.  As its 10.50am  we were told we could have it with hash browns and baked beans (850 calories) from the breakfast menu. We asked if we could have it with salad instead (as offered on the lunchtime menu) but we re told we d  have to pay another ¬£1.20!!!  The lunchtime omelette with salad is ¬£3.75 and the breakfast omelette is ¬£3.85!!! So our choice was having nothing  paying an extra ¬£1.20  consuming 250 calories more than we want or ordering the food and wasting it!! How is this encouraging healthy eating then?

To my eye there are still way too many littering our roads & countrysides. I wrote to a number of large supermarkets recently asking them to consider paper bags (at least they degrade a bit quicker) SAINBURYS were the least open to this idea  saying it wasn t practical!!! Tell that to most American supermarkets. MORRISONS didn t reply! TESCO - said great idea & sent me a ¬£10 voucher. ASDA also thought it a good idea. I even suggested they offset costs and get their marketing to offer paper bags as advertising space to major suppliers - off setting a charge to customers! Nice to see that it s been ignored! Still if they know that we ll buy these fancy hessian bags (I m a bit of a sucker for these) & these supermarkets can make a profit from our efforts to be environmentally friendly  then they ll be happy anyway! Simply BAN plastic bags - I just hope supermarkets read this? Just one of my pet hates...;;;;;2016-07-30T07:50:04+0000;1469865004;2016-07-30 09:50:04;1;4;1;0;5;4;3;1;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Today they surpassed themselves  I was charged ¬£117 for 3 bags of shopping & a crate of lager   I mentioned when paying I thought this seemed a lot but sainsburys has never been cheep so I packed up and went home. Upon unpacking I found that I had been charged ¬£66 instead of ¬£6  so my husband drove down to sainsburys for a refund  whilst he was driving down I found that all 15 cans of lager were dented with 2 leaking so I asked him to let customer services know. They promptly refunded the extra ¬£60 they had charged me and asked my husband to return the dented larger for a refund. I fail to see why as a matter of customer service  bearing in mind the fact you have just overcharged me ¬£60  you couldn t look at the receipt to see what we had bought & replaced the 2 cans which were leaking  instead you would prefer us to make a third journey to your store in a day.

I selected several items of clothing from the half price sale  all of which were labelled with the  50% of marked price  red sticker and took them to the self-service checkout. One of the items scanned at full price. Naturally  I queried it with the attending member of staff who apologised and said to follow her to customer services where a member of staff would rectify the issue. Said member of  customer services  response was  .....it s because they ve taken a sale sticker off something else and put it on there.  Admittedly  she was unaware that the customer stood in front of her was who she was accusing of basically stealing!! I pointed out that I most certainly had not and that there was another half dozen of the same item also stickered up  if she d care to check. At the time  although incredibly offended  I shrugged it off but three days later it is still bothering me and felt the need to express my disgust  dismay and disappointment at the total lack of professionalism portrayed  not to mention the deep upset at the accusation leveled at me.

At that point the cashier leaned over and looked and then said she would have to take the Peter rabbit 50p back as it was  COMPANY POLICY that they couldn t give them out. My daughter felt she had no choice but to hand it back . It didn t go back in the till either it was put to one side. I spoke to the manager to share my thoughts on this matter but they can t help because even though it s a small store the 4 cashiers who were working at that time my daughter bought her items know nothing about it...unless my daughter finds her receipt which incidentally wasn t given to her they can t pin point the MEAN cashier.

What s your policy on looking after staff who are carers who can t always get into work dead on time because of waiting for agency care to turn up? For example their contract states they start at 07:30 but they normally get in an hour later because they can t get care to start earlier but the line manager understands and is happy?  Is this a way of getting rid of them as breach of contract? If you changed your policy so all staff had to start at 4am and that member of staff who is soul carer for someone couldn t start then  do you give them notice to leave if there are no other jobs in the store that are that flexible?;;;;;2016-07-28T13:02:36+0000;1469710956;2016-07-28 15:02:36;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I woman was shopping in the store  pushing a little boy in a pushchair (perhaps 2 years old). The child was making intermittent high pitched screams which were quite startling and certainly got his mum more attention than she would have liked. I saw her speaking sternly to the child several times  asking him to stop the noise and be quiet. She only had a basket she was obvously only going to be in the shop for a short while. When I got to the till all I could hear was the sniping and moaning of other shoppers and  to my horror  Sainsburys employees. Things like;  he needs taking in hand    she was on the phone    its inbearable   and  why doesn t she take the child outside . People are so judgemental and intolerant  the poor mum must have been mortified. For all those people knew  the child could have been disabled or poorly  or the mother struggling to cope.....i m sure she didn t want him to make the noise. My point is that a) people need to get a grip and stop judging others so quickly  its a horrible personality trait. And b) it s completely unprofessional for members of staff to lead or join in with verbal abuse directed at any customer. What about helping her instead???

I said I still had some aches and pains  a stiff neck and sore hip and thigh. This was noted. I was told the problem had been fixed and machine repaired.

I regularly shop there  and rarely have any problems. However yesterday I needed to purchase some special suncream which was on the shelf and had a price ticket. I bought some other items too. I went through the self service tills  when I came to scan the suncream it said error product not recognised on the system. I called for help who then asked a colleague.  The outcome was that because it wasn t on the system I couldn t purchase it. I feel the service I received was poor and a  oh well tough  type attitude.  I have since been to a competitor and purchased the product with no problems. Please could you report back any findings. I really did feel that the customer service I received yesterday was well below standard and not helpful at all.;;;;;2016-07-27T10:25:51+0000;1469615151;2016-07-27 12:25:51;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

At 9.30pm tonight checked the progress of said pizza in the oven and the damn thing had a hole formed in the centre and had started to sag. Tried to salvage it and it started to collapse and fall through the slats. No dinner and a cooker to clean! I was furious because I am busy so I went to the store because I couldn t leave it. The Customer Services staff were pleasant enough but when I said that I didn t want a replacement pizza and was unlikely to buy another Sainsbury brand pizza the complaint escalated. The manager on duty came over and I explained what happened and he said his apologies and said the pizzas are mass-produced - well that s alright then - obviously customers  should not expect quality and perhaps I should ve just chucked it in the bin because at 10.15pm I was lucky enough to get a gift card with ¬£3.25 for the pizza refund and ¬£1.75 compensation.

Only to be told that the head office management have decided to no longer stock it at the branch in the large size.

It s so classy looking  but most importantly- the glass packaging with metal lid is responsible and completely and infinitely recyclable. They can even be re-filled or re-used. What would make it perfect for me  is the removal of the sticky tape seals. However  it is still better than those plastic seals. Would you consider bringing in customer re-fills  but ones that are NOT packaged in plastic. How about keeping large jars from which customers can bring their jars in  to be re-filled. That would be Zero Waste and is something I am striving for with my shopping. Thanks!;;;;;2016-07-25T20:53:01+0000;1469479981;2016-07-25 22:53:01;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am disabled and had just dislocated my hip so was unable to use my crutches. However my electric wheelchair was in the boot. My daughter went into customer services and asked if someone could help. A lovely young man came and lifted it out and put it together for me! He said someone would be happy to help me put it back in when is finished shopping. Thank you so much  this meant I could continue my shopping!  I would however  like to point out that I had to drive round the disabled parking three times before I was lucky enough to find a space. I then counted no less than four cars that although they had blue badges displayed  the drivers were still sitting in their cars! If the person in the car is disabled they don t need the space as they weren t getting out. If the passenger is disabled surely they could use the pick up and drop off area  then use a normal sized space. I was on the verge of going home then saw someone head back to their car and luckily I was able to get that space. However anyone else needing the space would have been disappointed. I have had to leave supermarkets before because there wasn t a disabled space available. Maybe it would be a good idea to speak to whoever is responsible for the car park and point out the potential loss of custom due to this. As the carkpark is shared between a few stores I will post this on their pages too.;;;;;2016-07-25T17:25:39+0000;1469467539;2016-07-25 19:25:39;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

However that all went to blazes on Saturday because of the attitude of the acting manager at the Watford  Dome Roundabout store.    In the media section I saw a copy of Spectre on BluRay with a ¬£4 orange circular sticker on it.  This sticker was underneath the hard plastic security case - i.e is was not a case of someone just placing a sticker on the product.  When I went to pay for it  I remarked on the low price to the cashier and he stated that even if it was a mistake then as it had a price sticker on it then it would be ¬£4.  The system read the barcode and displayed a price of ¬£15.  The cashier got his supervisor  who told me the price was ¬£15. So far so good  all were pleasant.    When I pointed out that  to my mind  the displayed price overrides the system price the supervisor went in search of her manager and came back a few minutes later with the answer of  No  it s ¬£15 .  Again I queried this  mentioning Trading Standards and eventually she came back with the store manager.  He said  It s ¬£15  do you want it?   I said   Yes at ¬£4  the marked price  to which he said:  It s an obvious pricing mistake and therefore the marked price is wrong .  I mentioned Trading Standards and he informed* me that he  knew retail law   I was wrong  he was right and that the price was ¬£15.  (*Informed - in a condescending  arrogant and smug way).  I replied that I would be contacting Trading Standards to which his parting shot was  Make sure that you tell them that I informed you of the correct price before you tried to buy it .  Your store manager may well be right (Yes  I know he is) as far as the law is concerned but whatever happened to customer relations  a spirit of goodwill and treating customers with respect  not smug arrogance? Don t your management staff get training on how to interact with the public  or does their  lofty  position mean that they see customers as an inconvenience?  Let s be honest here  what is ¬£11 to Sainsburys? Your annual profit may be down 13.8% but at ¬£587M it s still ¬£1.6 million per day  or approximately ¬£120k per opening hour.  Across 1200 stores that s an average of ¬£100 profit per store  per hour.  As the Dome Roundabout store is one of your largest stores then I d guess that the profit for it is in the region of ¬£200 per hour.  My  transaction  with your manager took about 3 minutes  which equates to ¬£10 profit for that store.  As I will never shop in Sainsburys again  was that ¬£10 profit really worth it?;;;;;2016-07-25T16:10:07+0000;1469463007;2016-07-25 18:10:07;2;9;2;0;11;8;2;6;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

And now only have winter meat lines in!  Don t even sell pork ribs for the bbq (I m sure it s only July) burgers are too are at a minimum with regards too choice  unless you want to select from the pre-prepared range which is normally half empty with all but a handful of items that are not  chilli  or excessively spiced (Basically the boring ones with no real taste  over packages and over priced). What about if your not able to eat this type of food? (IBS  chrones disease and similar where it agrovates your stomach). So what do you do? Oh yes  buy plain meats  buy either suitable bottled marinades or buy the products too make your marinade from scratch  but the downside for the consumer  we spend more money!  I don t think sainsbury s have realised that withdrawing shopping lines on inconsiderate timelines and not having the courtesy to inform the customer has consequences.  With many people are likely to have parties  family get togethers  birthdays or just friends round whilst the summer holidays are in swing.  This is not the time to discontinue bbq lines or change to winter meats.  People who decide to have a party or get together normally start checking out what is available  trying out products in readiness so that they can budget accordingly.... and Sainsbury s decide otherwise!! I ve done my main weekly shopping at Sainsbury s for nearly 30 years and went with my mother when I was a child  but now days I only do about 40% (over 2 weeks) of my shopping at Sainsbury s mainly due to the continual withdrawal of shopping lines and lack of real variety.  I also think that the attitude to customers instore by the management team is appaling (chaddesden)  promising too make enquiries and let us know  after a week  nothing!

I couldn t see any on the shelves other than the two that were up for display purposes. I thought it best to ask and a really helpful assistant went and had a look. I really appreciate the effort rather than just saying the usual  if it s not on the shelf we don t have any  line. She came back and said that unfortunately they were the last two and that they will eventually be sold but until they had a replacement display she couldn t sell it to me and she didn t know when they would be redoing the display. I don t mind  obviously I ve just been unlucky this time but doesn t it seem bizarre that they wouldn t sell me one of the last ones because it was advertising that they were selling them? Even though there was no more stock and would be no more stock as it s being discontinued. I just find it so strange to refuse a sale for the sake of an empty shelf when there was lots of other empty spots on shelves. As I say not a complaint to the assistant as she was lovely just thought it was worth pointing out!;;;;;2016-07-25T14:47:42+0000;1469458062;2016-07-25 16:47:42;1;3;1;0;4;3;2;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I took a dress back which I had purchased on the 18th July. I rang before hand and was told if I had no receipt it would be exchange only which was fine. I took it to the clothing department to be to first of all it couldn t be exchanged because I had no receipt  when I told the woman I had rang up previously and been told I could she changed her reason blaming it on  smelling like it had been through the wash  - with the tag still on and in tact I might add. I was quite aggressively told I couldn t bring back items I had worn and expect a full refund. I kept my calm and again stated it hadn t been worn and I wasn t asking for a refund but an exchange. There were two women in the queue behind me who both smelt the dress and said it didn t smell of fabric conditioner. This seemed to anger the woman more who again accused me I lying and trying to return an item I had worn! I have never in my life been so insulted. This is the first time I have bought a dress from sainsburys and I won t be going back again. I used to work in customer service myself and I would have never spoken to or accused a customer in the way this woman did with me. I took down her name and I will be making a formal complaint. I can t believe a company as big as sainsburys would hire someone with this attitude. By the time we left my son was crying from the way in which the woman had spoken to me to which she made the comment  if he s upset you should probably leave  bearing in mind I had a a whole trolley of shopping to buy. Disgraceful. I left the trolley with the shopping and went over the road to morrisons. I ve been a customer of sainsburys for years but I won t be returning after today.

What should have been a quick shop ended up taking far too long with incompetent staff on the delicatessen counter. Staff were very slow  didn t know what Parma ham was and then proceeded to slice it very thickly. Eventually got thin slices but it was shoved into the bag so I got home with a clump instead of nice slices. The slicing machine had  bits of meat and used plastic strewn all over and hygiene levels were questionable. One member of staff also tried to remove some meat stuck in the slicer with his fingers as it was spinning and could have lost his finger.

Surely the local Sainsburys  supermarkets can do something to help all the people stuck on the roads into the ports? They could join forces with the authorities and provide some essential food and other things like nappies  wipes  antibacterial hand spray  with their delivery vans. I d be happy to forgo a scheduled delivery if it meant the van was helping those stranded and I m sure I m not alone.

I usually shop in store but this week I decided to not drive the 40 mile round trip and have it delivered.  I have waited in all day for my 2-3pm slot with a 6 year old desperate to go to the park and a baby.  However when 3.30pm arrived and no shopping I attempted to log into my account and my account was no longer active.  I checked with my bank and they informed me that no attempt had been made to take the payment either.  I discussed this with an online representative who wouldn t tell me anything other than the store should have rung you  there is a problem with your account and I ll get them to ring you.  She wouldn t tell me when or if my shopping would delivered.  I explained to her if it wasn t I needed to know as I would have to drive to our local town and shop. But she insisted I wait for the phone call. Chris telephoned us from the store that was supposedly going to deliver.  He stated that as a discount code had been used that was for new customers only  my account had been cancelled along with my order as they d had instructions from head office.  In the same breath he went on to say they have tried to take a payment but it was declined.  So you were going to take the payment and not deliver my shopping.....lies?  It s strange but my bank have told me different and there was no way it would have been declined.   Unfortunately Chris wasn t particularly interested with my problem and wasn t prepared to help.  I requested to speak with the store manager who has said we should have been called  given opportunity to pay the extra if you were so concerned at the discount (which coincidently didn t state it was for new customers from the website i found it on  the only reason i set up a new account was I wanted to use my new email address linked with my phone as I cannot remember the password etc of the other to link it).  The manager has stated if I get my account reacticated they ll apply a voucher and he ll put in a complaint with head office.   I am not interest in discount vouchers  I wanted my shopping at the time it was suppose to be here.  I will never bother with Sainsburys as a company again  it ll save me the long trip every week.   You ve lost nearly ¬£60 plus today and my usual weekly shop  it s pittance to your company I am aware but if this is the way you treat your customers you ll lose more!;;;;;2016-07-23T15:40:31+0000;1469288431;2016-07-23 17:40:31;0;21;0;0;21;21;7;14;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

For a long time I have bought their own brand cornflakes be besides having less additives  including less sugar ( I am diabetic) they were 25p per 500grm pack. I went to get my usual monthly supply to find they had increased in price. Now I understand that prices rise  but not by 100percent. Yes one hundred percent price increase in Sainsburys. I couldntcouldn t believe it & checked with a staff member who seemed to believe I was being unreasonable! I asked to speak to the manager to be informed that he was in an important meeting  which made me feel even foolish to be suggesting that my concern was troubling me. Care of the customer used to be what sevice meant but my treatment at Sainsburys was based on a take it or leave it Couldn t care attitude. I still cant see justification for one hundred percent increases in their prices  and a bit of kindness & common decency would go along way.;;;;;2016-07-23T11:23:30+0000;1469273010;2016-07-23 13:23:30;0;4;0;0;4;4;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

On my last few visits every single department has been rude.  I accidentally knocked the 10p bags on the floor as I tried to take 2 off and the checkout operator tutted and moaned.  Around the store there were groups of 5-6 staff chatting/laughing - I found it quite intimidating.  I needed to return an item of clothing at 9pm and the Customer Service desk was closed - the cigarette kiosk ladies who were chatting sent me on a wild goose chase down to the checkouts (in a large store) to find  a lady with headset .  There was no lady with a headset.  My son wanted the price of an electrical item and there was noone on the department - the nearest member of staff in grocery made it quite clear he didnt want to find out the price.  A lady sitting on the checkout next to the self-service was chatting to the self-service staff member so as we unloaded our basket onto her checkout she looked at us in bemusement and told us curtly she wasnt open.  And the self service staff member was annoyed when we got the 3  items in packing area  error message 3 times...its not our fault!!  There is enough choice in South East Essex not to have to go to Sainsburies - why would we when every single staff member was pre-occupied or rude.;;;;;2016-07-23T06:11:12+0000;1469254272;2016-07-23 08:11:12;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I just wanted to send a quick message of thanks to the Sainsburys online ordering team.   My grandma has been ordering her shopping online (via my Uncle üòä) for the last year or so and she loves the convenience. Unfortunately just over two weeks ago we lost my grandpa   her husband of 67 years.   My uncle placed an order for her at the beginning of this week and mistakenly used the existing card details registered online - that of my late grandpa  which had already been cancelled by the bank. Your online team called my uncle of course to sort payment etc and he explained what had happened. The lady on the phone offered her sincere condolences  the payment method was rectified and no one thought any more about it.   However  when the order was delivered to my Grandma on Wednesday  a beautiful bunch of flowers had been included with a card reading  Condolences from the team at Sainsburys . This meant so  so much to my Grandma and she was quite overwhelmed. She loves flowers and especially roses (they were a particular favourite of my lovely grandpa too).   So I just wanted to say thank you  on behalf of our whole family. Such a wonderful  heartwarming gesture at a difficult time.;;;;;2016-07-22T14:22:05+0000;1469197325;2016-07-22 16:22:05;13;13;13;0;26;13;3;10;0;0;13;0;0;0;0;0;0

Whatever your policy  the manner in which she was spoken to was absolutely inappropriate and was clearly just an aggressive man who had decided to bully a woman shopping alone with children. As I also happened to be in the store at the time I asked the manager when this had become policy at Sainsburys. She wasn t able to answer this but told me it was for child protection reasons. I work in child protection and it is not. Then she told me it was because of health and safety  but wasn t able to tell me what aspect of health and safety  was being breached. Then she told me that they had a dress code and they wouldn t allow a gentleman to enter the store without a top on. Can I suggest a sign outside you stores  explaining your very strict dress codes as it might avoid such confusion in future.

Your prices have gone up rather sharply  a lot of products we picked up and put back again when we saw the prices. Then we went to the fridges and the stuff that was out of date on the day or just the next day was ridiculous. Hardly any bread and the bread that was there was going out of date with a day or two.

Your super chuffed that you have found 15 special offers. 2  You got to book your delivery slot but turns out there is none left. (That s ok it s my fault I should have remembered to book first)  3  You change the slot to the day after to find 14 of the 15 special offers have in your basket have expired because your ordering so far in advance. (2days)  Do you agree to pay full price for these 14 items?  Maybe not. üò° 4  You checkout after spending another 20 minutes having to find alternatives to the full price expensive items now in your trolley.  5  On arrival one item you ordered wasn t available which is fine but after your driver has gone you notice your steak is out of date after today.   I think that Sainsburys need to take a lesson in customer service from Waitrose who do not charge for substitutions and give you the item for free if it is about to go out of date. If I find an offer when I order I want this offer honoured for at least a week. Also when I spend ¬£90 a week on shopping I expect more vouchers. The ¬£1 a week in nectar points will take a long time to amount to anything. Morrisons used to give me ¬£5-¬£13 off my shopping in vouchers very frequently.;;;;;2016-07-18T21:57:07+0000;1468879027;2016-07-18 23:57:07;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ordered some travel money a couple of weeks ago and arranged to collect it from your store in Sprucefield on Tues 5th July. I live about 45 mins away from this store but i knew i would be in dublin that day and i could collect my travel money on my way home. I arrived at the store just after 5.30 (and i was in a real rush). much to my surprise i found the bureau closed with a sign saying it wouldnt be open again until 6pm. i couldnt wait until 6pm so i asked one of your checkout supervisors if anyone could serve me. The girl i spoke with was very nice. she told me the girl had gone on her tea but she would go upstairs and ask if she could come down. The girl from check out came back down again and said - im sorry shell be back at 6pm and no one else can serve you in the bureau. I told her i was in a rush and that i dont live near this store (i just wouldnt be able to get back here before my hols). she said she would go up again. A few mins later  Diane  arrived down with a face like thunder. I apologised to her and said i was in a rush and i just couldnt wait until 6pm. she barely acknowledged me - clearly not happy that i had interupted her dinner. she gave me my money and i was able to go on my way - but i was made to feel like a nuisance. your opening hours for the bureau say 9-8 or whatever the hrs are - they dont state  but we close for 1/2 hr when diane goes on her break so dont come at this time . I worked in a supermarket for 8 years when i was younger and i was often called off breaks to deal with situations / customers and i never begrudged any customer this. but also maybe you should have other people trained to man the bureau so you can give your staff breaks when required.;;;;;2016-07-18T12:03:43+0000;1468843423;2016-07-18 14:03:43;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I m 37 weeks pregnant and suffering with this heat   let alone trying to do the weekly shop with a nearly 2 year old. This morning I was contemplating not going shopping and was very worried that I was now too pregnant to do the weekly shop! So I got myself together and made it out and was just about to attempt to get my son into the trolley when the store security guard appeared from nowhere and offered to help get my son into the trolley seat - really needed the help as he s rather heavy and I m rather huge at the moment! The security guard couldn t have arrived at a better time! She then helped push the trolley into the store. She even said to me to go find her when I needed help leaving the store. I didn t need to do this as yet again  like my guardian angel she appeared when I was at the checkout. She entertained my son whilst I packed and paid  then she walked me to my car where she unloaded my bags in to the boot and even got my son into his car seat. Honestly after the day I was having and how awful I was feeling  this amazing lady saved the day. She was truly lovely and I can not thank her enough for all the help she gave me. Sadly I didn t catch her name but I hope that she gets recognition for what she did today.;;;;;2016-07-18T12:03:14+0000;1468843394;2016-07-18 14:03:14;31;1;32;1;34;1;1;0;3;0;31;1;0;0;0;0;0

I was having a nightmare of a day   I was having an allergic reaction to a bite on my arm and had run in to the store to go to the pharmacy with my 6 month old baby. They advised I spoke to my doctor so I went back to my car to make the call. After a little wait I was able to speak with a doctor on the phone. The doctor recommended something else to take  so for speed I just lifted my baby out of her car seat and carried her in to the store and back to the pharmacy. By the time I got back to the front of the store there was a torrential downpour and it just didn t stop. I don t mind a bit of rain but this was a big storm and I didn t have anything I could put over my baby to protect her. I waited and waited with my baby in my arms but the rain showed no signs of stopping.  Jason spotted us and without saying anything to me  he went over to the customer service desk and the next thing I knew he was there by my side with an umbrella. He walked us back to our car.  He was our hero that day! I wanted to tell you how impressed I was with his kindness. It was impressive customer service to say the least and I hope Jason can be recognised for his efforts. Well done Sainsbury s and thank you again Jason üòÄ;;;;;2016-07-17T18:32:07+0000;1468780327;2016-07-17 20:32:07;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Firstly  parent and child parking facilities are constantly being taken up by people with no children what so ever  there are never any spaces and im not sure about everyone else with a bad back  but trying to squeeze through a door that you can open 5cm is hard enough  nevermind fitting a toddler into a seat through that space  not to mention having to walk across an unsafe carpark with said toddler because some boy racer  grumpy old mad with a nice car or middle aged woman believes they have the right to a space they dont need. ALSO. The staff smoking space happens to be right beside the parent and child parking spaces  when theres three or four people there it crowds the air around the outer spaces  smoke being one thing i shelter my child from  i believe noone else should crowd her lungs with smoke. And finally  whilst in your store at the  free from  section  i was just about to buy a bottle of gluten free soy sauce when i checked the ingredients and woahh  it contained gluten  there were two or three bottles missing from that box meaning that two or three people out there are seriously ill due to your (as your employee stated)  oh it must have just been put there by mistake  (without an apology)  So basically i just believe that anyone stacking a shelf that people trust not to poison them and completely destroy the vili in their small intestine should probably be trained to know not to put something there that will poison someone and completely destroy the villi in their small intestine.

It wasn t busy for a Sunday. We ended up at the last till. Think it was 25 or 26. I know it was right at the end. The space in front of the till where I would put my trolley to put stuff after its scanned had a trolley full of empty plastic boxes. Even by the windows there were trollies full of rubbish or shopping unattended. So much so that I had to actually move trolley and squeeze myself around it to put stuff in. Normally I won t mind but I had our 2 year old with me and it wasn t ideal at all. Worse was that there was no apology or any effort of making it easier for me by the lady at the till. In fact when I had to leave after paying  I had to reverse the distance of 5-6 tills before I could put the trolley in the right direction. It wasn t a pleasant experience at all. I must say I have had better experiences in the corner shops and don t expect supermarkets the kind of yourselves to have no consideration to it being a clean comfortable experience for the shoppers. I am a long-standing fan of your stores but felt very let down this time.;;;;;2016-07-14T17:38:05+0000;1468517885;2016-07-14 19:38:05;0;7;0;0;7;7;3;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

When the food finally came we sent the chips back since my partner spotted them under the hot lights 10 minutes earlier.  Also overheard a member of staff asking another (who was on her break at the time) if there was anymore macaroni cheese.

Well done Sainsburys #proudtobeacolleague  Today we had a call from staff at Sainsbury s  Shorehead.  An elderly lady had gone into the store and chosen some shopping and some flowers.....but didn t know what to do next.   Staff had seen her getting distressed and more and more confused and called the Police. They looked after the lady until PC Dave arrived.  It transpired the lady had Dementia  which was why she had simply forgotten what to do next.   Sainsbury s staff were amazing and let the lady take the shopping and the flowers home for free as she had not taken her purse with her. A really lovely gesture from them.  PC Dave took the lady home. She was very scared and held PC Dave s hand all the way.  Once the lady was home  PC Dave got her settled  put her flowers on display in the window  and put her shopping away.

I want to ask if you can please do something about the HUGE amount of FOOD WASTE that is happening in this country in your stores.  I know that you do Basics range and I buy these products all the time but when it comes to fruit and vegetables  the main products that are thrown away before they even reach the store  I want to see more of these being sold in Sainsburys stores. I don t mind using wonky and mishapen fruit and vegetables in my cooking. That s just it. When I cook  I tend to chop up the ingredients so who cares what they looked like to start with?  I want to use fresh  British grown food. I want to pay a reasonable price for my food.  I also don t want to have to buy LARGE bags of food that I end up throwing away either because they contain too much for a single person to use in a week. There are thousands of Sainsburys customers like me who want to see these products on the store shelves. So please Sainsburys. Listen to us. We DO CARE about our food and the MASSIVE amount of food that is wasted in this country.;;;;;2016-07-12T11:58:54+0000;1468324734;2016-07-12 13:58:54;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

So I looked at the date and to my astonishment they were 08/2015!!!!! NEARLY A YEAR OUT OF DATE!!! Sweets for children  for toddlers!! Had I of not noticed my daughter would have been dishing these out  and had  God forbid  one child a broke a tooth or choked I would be the one to blame  as the parent  not you as the company!!! I would have been the irresponsible one!!! I took the entire box down to customer services  told the girl there and her face said a picture of disbelief herself!! She grabbed a fellow colleague (Jason/James) who took me back to the sweets  he then scooped up other 10p haribo bags of different varieties and we ended up carrying every single box down to customer services as he had found MORE out of date in different boxes from 12/2015 as well!!!   I am horrified as a parent  we can say to our kids  oh just grab a bag  to which they hold onto for the entire time  maybe without us giving it a once over  at which no point would any parent probably think of checking the date on a packet of these!!!! It s a bag of haribo.   Another colleague Leanne came and could understand completely what I was saying as she has children herself. She was mortified!! She very kindly gave me the sweets free (the ones in date!) and a ¬£10 gift card. Very nice of her to do so  but I was buying leggings for this price so essentially it outweighed itself! She said that is the only the most that SHE could do.  So my point is  walking out tonight I felt sorry for any kids that have had to endure a packet of these  probably without the parents even knowing  and with the dangers that could have arose from this  and that actually what is just a ¬£10 gift card?? You would have been putting many children in the hands of your poor stock checking/rotation  that were nearly an entire year out of date and with that there is no excuse  and actually a ¬£10 gift card doesn t just make what happened tonight go away! It s inexcusable.   Had it of been something for me I wouldn t have been too bothered if I m honest  but it s for children  and sweets aimed at children by children  and my children plus all the others would have suffered at the hands of you and with that I m angry!!  Flabbergasted!!   #sainsburys #angryparent;;;;;2016-07-11T23:52:36+0000;1468281156;2016-07-12 01:52:36;0;26;0;0;26;26;12;14;26;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Seizures can be scary  even more so when it s your little brother and there s no history to follow. Today my bro dropped to the floor in the middle of an isle and began convulsing. I called for help and dialled 999  immediately 2 members of staff came to my aid. They protected his head as he convulsed with me  brought blankets as we were in the cold isle  put him into recovery position. Timed the seizures for me  checked his breathing. Helped me with the 999 call on speaker  checked religiously on my brothers level of response and as soon as he started coming round after 2 very scary tonic clonic seizures were there to reassure him  keep him calm  keep him still on his side. There were three members of staff at least who helped from responding with first aid to fetching blankets and keeping the isles clear and I d like to thank all the staff particularly the girl who responded initially to my call for help and took control. The way she acted and calm methodical response she had to the situation was incredible. Also the man  who responded second and helped move my brother into recovery. My mother thanks you both and will thanking you personally I d assume but just from me I wanted to say how impressed I was and how amazing you all were. I m so sorry I ve forgotten you re name but I think the badge read  lourie  (so sorry if that s wrong) in particular you were incredible.

I tried to put ¬£30 of fuel in the tank  to last me all week  but when I tried to squeeze the pump it kept clicking off. I tried different position but no joy  so  after several minutes of trying and only getting just over 6 litres of diesel  I gave up and went to pay for the little your pump had graced me with.  I told the cashier there was a fault with the pump  and she told me they had previously reported it  which was good enough for me  then the woman on the other till rudely stuck her beak in and told me it was my car at fault causing the problem  and that the  petrol sensor must be faulty on your car  being the reason. Having been in work for several hours on a Sunday morning I wasn t in the cheeriest of moods anyway  but to have such a rudely worded and frankly ridiculous comment  frankly irritated me and it took every ounce of what little patience I had left to walk out without voicing my unhappiness. But I ve been ruminating on this since and thought  actually  you should be informed of this mockery of customer service. You see Sainsburys  yes my car is reasonably new  but it s not top of the range  but I have to say Im disappointed I didnt get the car with the spec that included bluetooth communication between petrol (despite it being diesel) tank and swanky sentient fuel pump at the supermarket. How wonderful it would have been to have that ability  now I m upset my car isnt like everyone elses. Maybe Sainsburys would like to send the member of staff to work for Maclaren  I m sure they would value her superior knowledge? #WontBEBuyingSainsburysFuelAgain #TheCustomerIsAlwaysRight;;;;;2016-07-10T17:34:49+0000;1468172089;2016-07-10 19:34:49;0;2;0;1;3;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Given that your store closes at 4pm  I felt it a reasonable expectation that all of your products would be available for sale until that time  but I was informed that the counters close at 3.30. I was forced to take my custom to a rival supermarket where my custom is more valued and they actually want to sell things to me.;;;;;2016-07-10T14:55:47+0000;1468162547;2016-07-10 16:55:47;1;4;1;0;5;4;1;3;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Shopping with my toddler half way through the shop it s obviously a great time to poop  only I ve left his nappies & wipes in the car! My bad  but I m thinking it s cool all supermarkets offer nappies & wipes for these kind of situations right! WRONG!!!! As if asking the lady working wasn t painful enough as she completely didn t understand my simple request for a nappy & wipes but just disregard the request answering me with the fact they don t provide emergency nappy kits and she s never heard of this and quite simply nothing she could do! Fair enough I understand if you don t have a baby your not going to use supermarket baby changing facilities  but I d like to point out to Sainsbury that both Asda and Tesco offer nappies & wipes which are available from customer services should you need them. I had to abandoned my shopping trolly to go back to my car and change my little one who obviously comes first and went off to redo my shop in Asda where they are more baby friendly!!;;;;;2016-07-10T14:37:35+0000;1468161455;2016-07-10 16:37:35;1;2;1;0;3;2;2;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

And the security post was only a few metres away yet he didnt come!!!! It was going on for a long time before anything was done by Sainsburys staff. So please tell me what sort of training do your employees have in this situation?

It is absurd and disturbing that food is being thrown away whwen there are people in real need.  It was absurd the first time I heard about it - and is worse now that many of the needy live in our own communities and it surely cannot be beyond Sainsbury s to think of innovative ways of passing this food onto people who need it.

If you took a poll of customer opinion i think you may find that the vast majority of customers[being sensible people mainly]would be very much against any policy which resulted in perfectly good food being wasted. I think that this group of people would also have more respect and loyalty for sainsbury s if you were more up-front and honest about current levels of waste and how you propose to improve this in the near future.It s not Rocket Science we are expecting it s good old common sense and moral responsibility! Could i suggest that you speak to Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall or at the very least watch his  Hugh s war on waste series which has quite a few home truths and not a few pretty good ideas on how things can be improved fairly simply. Perhaps you could let your customers know what you plan to do in the immediate future and long term about wasted food?

A programme on TV showed them choosing produce in South Africa and I was horrified to see the farmer having to plough his produce back into the ground just because Tesco thought it was the  wrong size for our customers . I started shopping at Sainsbury and have been for years now only to find that Sainsbury are employing the same tactics. I as a customer have never been asked if the size or shape of fruit or vegetables is to my liking. In my opinion it s the flavour that s important not the size or shape or look of what I m buying. With the amount of food poverty in this country and abroad can we really be that choosy that we d rather see food being ploughed back into the soil rather than having it offered for sale? If Sainsbury continue this practice then I again will vote with my feet and shop elsewhere. Can Sainsbury afford to lose customers at this trying time for retailers? I hope they can see sense.;;;;;2016-07-08T12:38:03+0000;1467981483;2016-07-08 14:38:03;1;8;1;0;9;8;1;7;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I haveboycotted your stores for the past 3 months  partly due to simply awful customer service and also due to the amount of waste I see.  Perfectly good food items are strewn around the shelves in wrong places to tempt customers - some of these are fridge lines which obviously are unsellable by the end of the day.   I have tried returning them to staff!  At 9pm  store shuts at 10pm every night I see mounds of fresh bread being bagged up to be sent to a  recycling facility  even though late customers like myself coming from work are waiting to buy it.  One of the staff even told me she refuses to work in that section because she is shocked by it.  Why bake so much just to discard it? To use it to generate energy also costs energy!  This does not even begin to consider the wasteful production methods in  modern  farming and transportation.  I believe Change.org is meeting with you this Friday to ask you what you intend to do about food waste - I hope you have some answers ready!;;;;;2016-07-07T17:54:03+0000;1467914043;2016-07-07 19:54:03;0;7;1;0;8;7;1;6;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0

I really miss the long sleeve modal/cotton/ elastane t shirts in bright colours. Mine are wearing out and they are perfect for work with a pair of office trousers. Teal  turquoise  bright pink/red  smoky blue-grey  navy please. I also like 3/4 length sleeves when it s warmer. They were fair trade cotton too. On another note. Some pretty fabric prints this year but have you thought about having more than one item in a fabric. I find a beautiful colour and fabric that fits my wardrobe only to discover it s in an oddly shaped top that I cannot wear eg a super bat wing sided vest top! Really hate patterned trousers too. As a slimish woman over 40 I love the elegance of a long summer skirt which needs to not be just plain black or a navy design(yet again). I met a well groomed lady customer in a long skirt this week (airforce blue?) whilst shopping at Sainsbury s and we chatted about them.;;;;;2016-07-07T07:57:55+0000;1467878275;2016-07-07 09:57:55;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We were on a narrowboat holiday and had limited food preparation space and cooking facilities so opted for some quick to cook meals.  Took our shop back to the boat and carried on our journey to Fradley Junction - The middle of nowhere!   For the first night we bought a pizza and some TTD Rustic chips. This was a mistake. Followed the cooking instructions for the chips and pizza. They went in our little calogas oven. The pizza cooked beautifully and in the recommended time.   The chips on the other hand -  were still raw potato. An hour later - still raw potato. finally after an hour and a half they started to brown - at the edges. The edges quickly turned black - while the middle of the chips were still raw potato. After nearly 2 hours we decided to eat what we had. Some were cooked through - some weren t.   To our horror - they were disgusting. Sweet  horrible - tasted almost like carrots. We threw them straight in the bin and went to bed hungry. Had we not been so far away from where we bought them we would have taken them back to the store in the state they were in - but we were miles away and not planning on being back for another week.;;;;;2016-07-05T20:50:58+0000;1467751858;2016-07-05 22:50:58;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My son in law was given a Fathers  Day gift from his daughters. The gift was used a couple of times (a device for shaving the head) and then it worked erratically  finally proving to be useless. He took it in to customer services at Sainsbury s Calcot store  and asked for a replacement. He was told to look round the shop for one.  We spent almost fifteen minutes before we found the shelf where they had been but there were none there. When we returned to customer services they told us there were none in stock as they had checked (why didn t they check before to save wasting out time hunting?!!!). He then asked for a refund or a credit note only to be told that this was not Sainsbury s policy. He had no receipt but obvious proof of purchase because of the item he had showed to them  demonstrating the fault!  So we walked out of the store with nothing except a useless item which had cost close on ¬£20! Nice one Sainsbury s - a disgusting way to treat customers!!!;;;;;2016-07-05T06:19:18+0000;1467699558;2016-07-05 08:19:18;2;21;2;1;24;21;11;10;9;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

At least it died enjoying the non existing jam. I showed a member of staff and asked if she can show the spider to the manager. Well mr/ms manager nice that you could not even be bothered to come out to discuss the spider issue  you just sent the member of staff out to give us a 50p refund. Well manager its nice to know that you have a managers job but can t be arsed to be one when dealing with customers. Perhaps I can get such a cushy job with sainsbury as it seems they don t send you for training they just let you get on with it. Don t worry I won t be back so you won t have to face me.

A lot of people who eat dairy free products are vegans so also don t eat egg  egg is also an allergen like milk and wheat so it s also saying that egg allergy sufferers aren t as important as those affected by milk or gluten. Are there any products that the recipe might be changed or any new dairy and egg free products in the pipeline?

I have had my shopping delivered for several years now but this morning for the first time your driver completely exceeded expectations and went above and beyond his work. I suffer from rheumatoid disease and early mornings are particularly bad for my joints  your driver identified the struggle I had and offered to bring my shopping through to the kitchen but also unpacked the crates near the appropriate storage  meaning I did not have to struggle with carrying bags unnecessarily. He took the time to talk to me about my condition and made sure everything was accessible for me. He was polite  courteous and an asset to your company. Please pass on my thanks and gratitude. Unfortunately I was unable to see his name but hopefully you can trace him from my order number.  Regards Amy Westgate (Johnson)  Quarry wood store  aylesford.

Please be aware that Sainsburys online accounts are still being hacked and money being spent via them for deliveries . I had an email and text message on Friday to inform me of changes to my account. I rang the number provided to ask what changes  as I hadn t made any  only to get the reply that it was a generic email sent out in error  and not to worry. I checked my bank account yesterday and found that over ¬£300 had been authorised for delivery to an address in London (I live in Newcastle upon Tyne). After numerous phone calls to cancel my debit cards  online accounts at Sainsburys  and to the fraud helpline at Sainsburys  it was too late to stop this transaction.   This account hasn t been used this year  and so I blame Sainsburys for A) authorising it  and B) fobbing me off via a girl whose sole priority I suspect was to get me off the phone on Friday evening so she could finish work rather than doing her job. I was told that if I d been forwarded to the relevant fraud department  this could ve been stopped. Now I am ¬£300 out of pocket  no bank cards  and faced with the stress if chasing my money back via my bank.  Obviously I don t be shopping with yourselves again  and urge others to be cautious  as this has been happening for a number of years  looking back through social media and news. You really should also offer a  helpline  rather than just having people who couldn t give a monkey s on the other end.;;;;;2016-07-03T09:12:31+0000;1467537151;2016-07-03 11:12:31;1;3;1;0;4;3;3;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

He wasn t at work  but in uniform and was a great ambassador for your store. Please feed this back to him?

I wanted to bring to your attention an outstanding member of staff you gave  Ann- Marie who works in Kelso in the Scottish Borders. Every Saturday night we get deli pizzas for us and the kids for a family movie night  the kids really enjoy this. My daugther is 10 and likes mushroom pizza which is not one of the standard pre- made varieties. We have been asking for  one and having it made up while we shop.  Over the last few weeks Anne Marie has automatically made this up for my daugther and placed aside in the fridge  without fail - even if she is on her break  when we arrive and my daugther requests her pizza  like today there was already one done as she knows we do this every weekend.  Quite amazing  she does this every week and makes a 10 year old girl very happy!! Thank you  over and above :-);;;;;2016-07-02T15:01:55+0000;1467471715;2016-07-02 17:01:55;242;33;251;7;291;33;30;3;59;0;238;8;1;0;0;0;0

Apparently on that day I exceeded the time  allowed  by 21 minutes  for which I have been sent a fine of ¬£70!! Oh sorry  reduced to ¬£30 if I pay by 12th July. I admit I knew of the time limit but also did not exactly track it. I would be happy to pay for parking but choosing this manner of imposing parking restrictions is a very bad move in my opinion; I d like to point out that on that day I met an old friend at the store for some lunch as it is a convenient place for us both. I spent ¬£15 on food and drink and then after we had parted I  went back into the store and chose some bedding for my father  chose some home improvement magazines and had to ask the pharmacist for advice for some tablets I needed.  After all this I had to wait a few minutes to pay as there were only 2 checkouts open and personally I like to pay a person who will say thank you  rather than use a self service machine. After all this I left straight away. I spent over ¬£85 in the store that day. Also I  spent a similar amount in another branch that same week. You set out your stores to encourage people to browse and linger and spend time and money and then choose to have your parking spaces controlled by greedy 3rd parties rather than choosing fair means of control which would not upset good customers.  How many others like me have been similarly penalised I wonder and are feeling similarly willing to never give you another penny? I am really keen to hear your views on this matter.

I took it to the till and it rung up as ¬£160. I quibbled the price and someone was called to check it out and a message came back saying it was in the wrong place. I accepted that but then the man came to the checkout and said actually you were right it was that price but I can t sell it to you for that price as the ticket should have been removed. I argued the case but they refused. I think this is incorrect. The price advertised should be the price I pay. They lost the sale because I refused to buy it for the higher price and I would probably say I wouldn t buy thing like that from Sainsburys now. Fobbing me off like that. Surely that s false advertising? I m really annoyed at their attitude. Cheating your customers by advertising something and then saying you can t have it for that price. Disgraceful on their part. I spend a lot of money in Sainsburys and that store most of the time. Not just food but clothes and toys and electricals in the past too.
