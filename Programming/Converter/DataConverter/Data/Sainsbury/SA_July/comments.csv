When we bought the TV we asked about what the guarantee would cover and were told that we would be entitled to an identical replacement if there was a problem. Now when I went to look for the replacement I was told I couldn't have that one and they would only give me a replacement of smaller TVs and of less quality and without the same extras as the TV I had, HD, Freeview etc. All I wanted was the same original TV which I have the right to as it is under the guarantee not for a store manager to attempt to rip me off completely with a smaller product of less quality. When buying the product I was led to believe I was paying for a quality TV with a guarantee which would be upheld by your stores. In the future I now know not to believe the lies of the sales season. I did chose Sainsbury over other places w the same deals and now this is your attitude.  Extremely disappointed.;2016-07-31T16:06:29+0000;0

It is not the pricing, I consider it to be good value. It is the lack of flexibility and independent thinking on the part of your staff. If your lunch menu starts at 11.30 then I would assume at 10.50, the salads would be prepared to begin serving at lunchtime. Surely, if salad is available at lunch, then a customer requesting almost exactly the same meal from the breakfast menu but requiring salad instead of the hash browns and beans could be (and should be) accommodated especially when the cost of providing salad at lunch is less than the breakfast meal. The customer should not charged another £1.20. There are few eateries that don't try to accommodate alternative requests and I am disappointed that Sainsburys is one of them.;2016-07-31T21:40:08+0000;0

You'd think they'd have seen my ID plenty of times by now and remember. I'm not exactly a face you can forget. I'm covered in piercings for crying out loud. It's Not very common in my area!   I don't care if it's down to staff discreation, or if one person thinks I do and person thinks I don't. What I care about is your evidential lack of good practice and safeguarding those who may appear to look younger than they actually are, by serving them age restricted items without asking for ID!!!  Are you bloody mad?! My friend went in and brought fags today without being ID'd, to see if she'd actually get served. She's 18 and really doesn't look it. But once again, your staff failed to request ID. Maybe it's due to laziness. Maybe it's due to poor staff training, rather than just 'staff discretion'.  Either way, I don't care. I've put a formal complaint in, and I've got the number for trading standards/consumer line ready for tomorrow and I shall be informing them of both incidents.

However they're happy to request ID for other age restricted items. Are people forgetting that to buy tobacco products, you have to 18+?! And to buy a scratch card you have to be 16+?!   So... All you have an issue with me complaining about not being served a scratch card? Yet you're forgetting that they're not actually ID'ing people who clearly do not pass the challenge 25 when requesting to buy tobacco products?   You lot must need your heads examined😂😂😂;2016-08-01T18:37:05+0000;0

Many thanks for taking the time to give us a holla! Glad to hear you got the assistance you needed, I'm hoping hubby is feeling better now?

I was with my 2-year-old daughter and 10-month old baby boy  neither of whom were entirely happy so I was carrying him in a baby carrier and had (rather naughtily) opened a pack of Smarties to keep her quiet! A member of staff helped me to the self-service checkout when he saw me waiting in a queue  and even scanned and packed my shopping for me! I explained about the Smarties  and he said that he wouldn t dream of taking them off her to scan  so she ended up with a little present!

I was there earlier and an old lady was in the queue in front of me  moving very slowly  fumbling with her things. Your employee was fantastic! She scanned then packed every item for her. She got out of her seat to lift the bags into her trolley  she helped her use the card machine  talking kindly and smiling all the time  speaking clearly so the lady could hear and being patient when it took her more than one go. It made me really happy to see because I have elderly parents and I frequently see assistants in shops tutting and rolling their eyes when they are taking time. I took note of the employee s name  Pauline. I hope somebody lets her know that the respect she shows your elderly customers is noticed and very much appreciated!

I have 3 under 6 to get out safely and often struggle to park in a P&C space due to people without children using them.

Different sizes of stores have very different operational requirements and running costs, which in turn affect our product pricing. Our local stores tend to have higher operating costs than our superstores as they’re located in more expensive locations and have longer opening hours. Hope this provides some clarity!

Her and her friend both looked at the coin and she commented that she had never seen one before and was thrilled that she now had one! At that point the cashier leaned over and looked and then said she would have to take the Peter rabbit 50p back as it was  COMPANY POLICY that they couldn t give them out. My daughter felt she had no choice but to hand it back . It didn t go back in the till either it was put to one side.

Her and her friend both looked at the coin and she commented that she had never seen one before and was thrilled that she now had one! At that point the cashier leaned over and looked and then said she would have to take the Peter rabbit 50p back as it was  COMPANY POLICY that they couldn t give them out. My daughter felt she had no choice but to hand it back . It didn t go back in the till either it was put to one side. I spoke to the manager to share my thoughts on this matter but they can t help because even though it s a small store the 4 cashiers who were working at that time my daughter bought her items know nothing about it...unless my daughter finds her receipt which incidentally wasn t given to her they can t pin point the MEAN cashier.

Nothing like throwing it back in his face. If he can't find out which one did it. Maybe he should go to the store and line the four cashiers up and shoot them.

I would be amazed if they do not pick this up . If you are not contacted shortly , if you don't hear you must contact the Care line  at Holborn through the contact number found on every own label product . I worked for JS for a good many years and I know they would be more than happy to investigate .  It certainly sounds very irregular , I've no idea of the significance of the coin etc but no customer should leave any store feeling dissapointed and it's certainly not the view of the company and  I hope you sort this out and get a satisfactory response , good luck . .;2016-07-31T14:27:17+0000;0

What s your policy on looking after staff who are carers who can t always get into work dead on time because of waiting for agency care to turn up? For example their contract states they start at 07:30 but they normally get in an hour later because they can t get care to start earlier but the line manager understands and is happy?  Is this a way of getting rid of them as breach of contract? If you changed your policy so all staff had to start at 4am and that member of staff who is soul carer for someone couldn t start then  do you give them notice to leave if there are no other jobs in the store that are that flexible?;2016-07-28T13:02:36+0000;10155053606129377_10155053668589377;pageowner;0;Hi Natalie.

During my conversation with your driver I also discovered that until recently the Thetford store didn t cover deliveries in Thetford.....thing your logistics team may be slightly crazy😖;2016-07-28T09:51:30+0000;10155053256739377_10155053365104377;pageowner;0;I understand why you may think that however we have planned routes and areas to maximize efficiency. What you'll usually find is drivers from the Thetford store, for example, may only travel in one direction when leaving the store and that's why the areas they cover may seem unusual.

I said I still had some aches and pains  a stiff neck and sore hip and thigh. This was noted. I was told the problem had been fixed and machine repaired.

I regularly shop there  and rarely have any problems. However yesterday I needed to purchase some special suncream which was on the shelf and had a price ticket. I bought some other items too. I went through the self service tills  when I came to scan the suncream it said error product not recognised on the system. I called for help who then asked a colleague.  The outcome was that because it wasn t on the system I couldn t purchase it. I feel the service I received was poor and a  oh well tough  type attitude.  I have since been to a competitor and purchased the product with no problems. Please could you report back any findings. I really did feel that the customer service I received yesterday was well below standard and not helpful at all.;2016-07-27T10:25:51+0000;10155050087304377_10155050150519377;pageowner;0;Hi Alison.

The Customer Services staff were pleasant enough but when I said that I didn t want a replacement pizza and was unlikely to buy another Sainsbury brand pizza the complaint escalated. The manager on duty came over and I explained what happened and he said his apologies and said the pizzas are mass-produced - well that s alright then - obviously customers  should not expect quality and perhaps I should ve just chucked it in the bin because at 10.15pm I was lucky enough to get a gift card with £3.25 for the pizza refund and £1.75 compensation. Way to go Sainsbury s!;2016-07-26T21:30:36+0000;10155048628634377_10155049820244377;pageowner;0;Hi Ann, apologies for the inconvenience, doesn't sound ideal.

Expanding on the advice my colleague Megan gave you, these bags technically are recyclable - just not by regular kerbside methods. Unfortunately as they contain food matter, they couldn't be recycled in the normal way anyway, so we recommend to customers that these teabags are compostable. I hope this answers your questions, but if you need any more answers, let me know and I'll try my best. Ryan.;2016-07-28T14:51:31+0000;0

It s so classy looking  but most importantly- the glass packaging with metal lid is responsible and completely and infinitely recyclable. They can even be re-filled or re-used. What would make it perfect for me  is the removal of the sticky tape seals. However  it is still better than those plastic seals. Would you consider bringing in customer re-fills  but ones that are NOT packaged in plastic. How about keeping large jars from which customers can bring their jars in  to be re-filled. That would be Zero Waste and is something I am striving for with my shopping.

I am disabled and had just dislocated my hip so was unable to use my crutches. However my electric wheelchair was in the boot. My daughter went into customer services and asked if someone could help. A lovely young man came and lifted it out and put it together for me! He said someone would be happy to help me put it back in when is finished shopping. Thank you so much  this meant I could continue my shopping!  I would however  like to point out that I had to drive round the disabled parking three times before I was lucky enough to find a space. I then counted no less than four cars that although they had blue badges displayed  the drivers were still sitting in their cars! If the person in the car is disabled they don t need the space as they weren t getting out. If the passenger is disabled surely they could use the pick up and drop off area  then use a normal sized space. I was on the verge of going home then saw someone head back to their car and luckily I was able to get that space. However anyone else needing the space would have been disappointed. I have had to leave supermarkets before because there wasn t a disabled space available. Maybe it would be a good idea to speak to whoever is responsible for the car park and point out the potential loss of custom due to this. As the carkpark is shared between a few stores I will post this on their pages too.;2016-07-25T17:25:39+0000;10155044977229377_10155045192974377;pageowner;0;Hello, I'm really sorry about this Naj.

However that all went to blazes on Saturday because of the attitude of the acting manager at the Watford  Dome Roundabout store.    In the media section I saw a copy of Spectre on BluRay with a £4 orange circular sticker on it.  This sticker was underneath the hard plastic security case - i.e is was not a case of someone just placing a sticker on the product.  When I went to pay for it  I remarked on the low price to the cashier and he stated that even if it was a mistake then as it had a price sticker on it then it would be £4.  The system read the barcode and displayed a price of £15.  The cashier got his supervisor  who told me the price was £15. So far so good  all were pleasant.    When I pointed out that  to my mind  the displayed price overrides the system price the supervisor went in search of her manager and came back a few minutes later with the answer of  No  it s £15 .  Again I queried this  mentioning Trading Standards and eventually she came back with the store manager.  He said  It s £15  do you want it?   I said   Yes at £4  the marked price  to which he said:  It s an obvious pricing mistake and therefore the marked price is wrong .  I mentioned Trading Standards and he informed* me that he  knew retail law   I was wrong  he was right and that the price was £15.  (*Informed - in a condescending  arrogant and smug way).  I replied that I would be contacting Trading Standards to which his parting shot was  Make sure that you tell them that I informed you of the correct price before you tried to buy it .  Your store manager may well be right (Yes  I know he is) as far as the law is concerned but whatever happened to customer relations  a spirit of goodwill and treating customers with respect  not smug arrogance?

Let s be honest here  what is £11 to Sainsburys? Your annual profit may be down 13.8% but at £587M it s still £1.6 million per day  or approximately £120k per opening hour.

Slightly confused as for years during the summer, a selection of unmarinated ribs have been available until the end of August, small rib, jumbo rib and rack of rib. Excellent for those who like myself and several of my friends that have issues with the amount of excessive ""chilli"", ""spice"" ""Thai"" etc flavoured bbq meats that is available on prepackaged which do not sit well when you have food intolerancs.  To my dismay no Pork ribs! Strange, it's not even the end of July and according to Adam, whom I had to ask yesterday, it was a corporate move and Sainsburys now only do rack of ribs!  Strange how he'd know that when he'd only just got back from his holiday himself (that is according to another member of staff). I felt fobbed off, as this didn't actually answer my question.  I then checked your website, to find that ribs are available on line?! So how can he tell me that Sainsbury as a whole no longer do ribs during the bbq season.  If your no longer selling ribs why sell marinades? If you don't sell the meat is there a point in selling the marinade? No!  Instead of ribs, the SEL's now display pork belly slices! We now have a choice of 5 different packs (although some the same weight) in Pork belly and a minimum of of 6 packs of pork loin and only one facing for ribs and then it's for rack.  There was only 1 pack available on Monday and 4 yesterday afternoon, all of which had more fat than meat on! I even asked the question if I could order in a quantity for my birthday bbq Birthday party.... Answer no! Well, if I can't get the ribs then I just as well do the entire shopping (including champagne, spirits and wine) elsewhere. This isn't the only shopping lines we've lost in recent months... My coffee, a large amount of baking products, soup, noodle soup for lunch, can't buy jacket potatoes (6 potatoes in a pack with the longest potato being about 12cm long is not a jacket potato and we can get that size in a standard bag) as well as other stuff. instead  we get another ""the same"" by a different brand, but lose the variety instead.  It also defeats the recipe section on your website when it's either not available in store in the first place or within months stop selling the product altogether. Chad has got real bad of late, the only bit the seems to run well is within the wines (James) or the girls on the checkouts. We now have to drive 40 miles round trip to Waitrose to get the standard of customer service, choice and variety that we once did.  I'm glad that Waitrose have finally listened to requests that they open a branch in Derby! My prayers will have been answered! We probably spent £750 a minimum a month with the amount of entertaining and general shopping a month.  We might be lucky if we spend £200 a month now and I know I'm not the only one within my group of friends that aren't happy.  Sainsburys are becoming too much like Asda and Tesco!;2016-07-25T17:22:38+0000;0

I couldn t see any on the shelves other than the two that were up for display purposes. I thought it best to ask and a really helpful assistant went and had a look. I really appreciate the effort rather than just saying the usual  if it s not on the shelf we don t have any  line. She came back and said that unfortunately they were the last two and that they will eventually be sold but until they had a replacement display she couldn t sell it to me and she didn t know when they would be redoing the display. I don t mind  obviously I ve just been unlucky this time but doesn t it seem bizarre that they wouldn t sell me one of the last ones because it was advertising that they were selling them?

I hope you're having a great day! I'm really sorry about this, depending on the product we are sometimes unable to sell display models until they move into clearance - but we'll find out if that's the case for you and I'll see what we can do for you on our end! Can you confirm the time that you popped into store? Also, do you have a model number for the soda stream machine? I'll need this to find the right product. I might be able to find you one at another store nearby! Ryan.;2016-07-25T14:55:08+0000;0

I couldn t see any on the shelves other than the two that were up for display purposes. I thought it best to ask and a really helpful assistant went and had a look. I really appreciate the effort rather than just saying the usual  if it s not on the shelf we don t have any  line. She came back and said that unfortunately they were the last two and that they will eventually be sold but until they had a replacement display she couldn t sell it to me and she didn t know when they would be redoing the display. I don t mind  obviously I ve just been unlucky this time but doesn t it seem bizarre that they wouldn t sell me one of the last ones because it was advertising that they were selling them?

It was about 12.30 when I asked. It's probably the clearance thing that prevented it. If you could find another though that would be a bonus! The model Number is 1013211447.

I took a dress back which I had purchased on the 18th July. I rang before hand and was told if I had no receipt it would be exchange only which was fine.

What should have been a quick shop ended up taking far too long with incompetent staff on the delicatessen counter. Staff were very slow  didn t know what Parma ham was and then proceeded to slice it very thickly. Eventually got thin slices but it was shoved into the bag so I got home with a clump instead of nice slices. The slicing machine had  bits of meat and used plastic strewn all over and hygiene levels were questionable. One member of staff also tried to remove some meat stuck in the slicer with his fingers as it was spinning and could have lost his finger. I think your Sunday staff need some training.;2016-07-24T20:13:08+0000;10155041948189377_10155041976519377;pageowner;0;Sorry the service wasn't up to scratch Emily!

It is a fairly simple question that I am sure someone in your office are able to answer - what happens to the food in your shops, that you are not able to sell because of bruises/cuts/etc, but that clearly are completely edable?   After 20 minutes of reading I found out that 11 of your stores donate surplus food to FoodCycle, which is great. But what about the other 1200 other stores (approximately - I cannot find how many stores you actually operate). What do they do with their surpolus food?  Your sustainability plan looks all nice and promising and it keeps throwing out numbers and years, without actually showing to anything spesific. e.g. you promise this and that without specifying HOW you will do keep your promise. A promise without being able to show us as consumers results, are to me empty promises.   In addition you promise to help customers reduce operational waste, but isn't that just pushing the responsibility over to the consumer? Stores like sainsburys (and all the others to be fair) are as much a part of the problem and the consumers. But you also have an opportunity to be a part of the solution! And to start that off, you could tell me what your stores do with their surplus food :)  Thanks!;2016-07-24T18:12:29+0000;0

It talks very nicely about helping consumers waste less (without saying how). It also talks about utilising vegetables not fittes for sale, because they are too ugly, which is great. And it mentions how you encourage your suppliers become better at utilising crops in every way. In fact everything I have read shows me how Sainsburys is making the different parts of its value chain more sustainable, without mentioning the part of the value chain that is in fact your responsibility - your stores!   Nothing of what you have sent me answers my question. What happens with food surplus at my local Sainsburys?;2016-07-24T20:03:35+0000;0

Since June 2013, surplus food that can’t be used by its charity partners to feed vulnerable people is now processed into animal feed to support British farmers or used to generate energy through anaerobic digestion. And all general waste from stores is recycled or turned into fuel. Hope this helps. Stephen;2016-07-24T21:19:48+0000;0

Our consumer research shows that the Union flag has a wider and stronger message than the St. George’s Cross when applied to English products. Our research also showed that for products from Scotland the Saltire has much more meaning regarding its place of origin for both our Scottish and English customers.

OnlyTesco publishes their waste tonnage. All the others should too. Waste food going to landfill increases methane and therefore global warming. The Cooperatve in Glynneath is the ONLY supermarket that donates food to the apes and monkeys at the Sanctuary. The branch at Ystradgynlais used to until Tesco and Asda between them squeezed them out and they closed. Safeway also used to donate until Morrisons replaced them. So did Sommerfield donate.

I know the weather had been warm but surely if it cold fridge they shouldn't be dry..I was in store early and not late afternoon. They should of been fresh.;2016-07-24T07:31:45+0000;0

I live in Dover and have seen first hand the chaos, the disruption, and the suffering all those stuck are going through. I guess those joining the queues now will be more prepared for the huge delays but I was really concerned about those who didn't know and who may still be stuck. We have never known anything like it here. We have Operation Stack quite frequently which is a worry but this is far worse. While questions can be asked about how this has been allowed to happen, it's not the fault of those stuck, who have small children, pets, elderly or infirm relatives, and they really need more help than they are getting. I am sure they would be happy to pay for more supplies, they just can't get access to them. So I was just reaching out to see if you could help in any way. Tesco sent out one van yesterday, but the newspapers are quoting 250,000 people so one van isn't going to go very far.;2016-07-24T08:04:46+0000;0

I usually shop in store but this week I decided to not drive the 40 mile round trip and have it delivered.  I have waited in all day for my 2-3pm slot with a 6 year old desperate to go to the park and a baby.  However when 3.30pm arrived and no shopping I attempted to log into my account and my account was no longer active.  I checked with my bank and they informed me that no attempt had been made to take the payment either.  I discussed this with an online representative who wouldn t tell me anything other than the store should have rung you  there is a problem with your account and I ll get them to ring you.  She wouldn t tell me when or if my shopping would delivered.  I explained to her if it wasn t I needed to know as I would have to drive to our local town and shop. But she insisted I wait for the phone call. Chris telephoned us from the store that was supposedly going to deliver.  He stated that as a discount code had been used that was for new customers only  my account had been cancelled along with my order as they d had instructions from head office.  In the same breath he went on to say they have tried to take a payment but it was declined.  So you were going to take the payment and not deliver my shopping.....lies?  It s strange but my bank have told me different and there was no way it would have been declined.   Unfortunately Chris wasn t particularly interested with my problem and wasn t prepared to help.  I requested to speak with the store manager who has said we should have been called  given opportunity to pay the extra if you were so concerned at the discount (which coincidently didn t state it was for new customers from the website i found it on  the only reason i set up a new account was I wanted to use my new email address linked with my phone as I cannot remember the password etc of the other to link it).  The manager has stated if I get my account reacticated they ll apply a voucher and he ll put in a complaint with head office.   I am not interest in discount vouchers  I wanted my shopping at the time it was suppose to be here.  I will never bother with Sainsburys as a company again  it ll save me the long trip every week.

She told me he was called Chris.  When Chris rang up, he put us through to someone else higher up (we believed store manager of a physical shop where our order should have come from).....maybe his name was James I think, I can't be sure.  He told us to activate our account. So if we were speaking with managers of the online store supposedly, who phoned/emailed them to ensure our order wasn't dispatched?  There must be someone higher up the ladder to speak with.  I am not interested in reactivating my account, it shouldn't have been deactivated in the first place and I should have received a call!  It's really sad this is how a loyal customer (not anymore) is treated,  like I have mentioned previously I won't be traveling the long journey to the store weekly anymore.  I just hope this doesn't happen to anyone else, not all websites state the terms and conditions of vouchers if only you'd phoned or emailed to say I would have happily paid the extra and had my order.;2016-07-24T09:56:52+0000;0

UK legislation states that turkeys can be shackled by their legs for up to six minutes and other birds for up to three minutes before they are killed - despite evidence showing that the procedure causes extreme suffering. Chickens and turkeys are bred to grow so fast that most suffer from painful leg problems.  Before being killed, birds' heads are supposed to be immersed in an electrified waterbath in an attempt to cause unconsciousness. Some birds defecate during stunning meaning that birds can inhale faeces when they are dipped into the waterbath. Turkeys can also suffer painful pre-stun electric shocks because their wings hang lower than their heads and can enter the bath first. Despite attempts to change the system, scientists estimate that around 6% of turkeys - or 2.1 million turkeys each year - still receive prestun electric shocks.  Birds are known to ""swan-neck"" - raising their heads when entering the electrical waterbath and so avoiding full immersion. This is a particular problem for ducks and geese. Any birds who are not stunned are meant to be decapitated by a 'back-up killer' whilst conscious. The killer will be working with a line speed of up to 9,000 birds an hour and any birds who are missed continue on to the neck-cutter.  Birds routinely regain consciousness before they die if they do not have a cardiac arrest when they enter the waterbath. This is because they take much longer than mammals to lose brain responsiveness. Broiler chickens have been shown to recover consciousness 52 seconds after stunning in an electrical waterbath. Hens have been shown to recover consciousness after as little as 22 seconds. This means that birds who do not have a cardiac arrest will recover consciousness after being knived. It takes chickens nearly three minutes to lose brain responsiveness if both carotid arteries are severed and around 5 minutes if one jugular artery and one carotid artery is severed. If 90% of birds have a cardiac arrest at stunning, a further 62 million birds will regain consciousness before they die from loss of blood.  14 abattoirs appear to use automatic neck-cutters which only sever one carotid artery. In this case, birds who do not have a cardiac arrest at stunning will still be alive when they enter the scalding tank. Viva! estimates that 8.4 million birds will only have one carotid artery cut and will therefore be conscious on entering the scalding tank.  http://www.viva.org.uk/what-we-do/slaughter/slaughter-farmed-animals-uk;2016-07-23T11:03:01+0000;2

As we are committed to ensuring the good health and welfare of all of our farm animals, we have been working closely with our producers and to ensure the continuity of supply, we changed to outdoor bred in February 2016. This change was part of a large project which took into account everything from farm to fork across all of our pork suppliers. Going forwards, the Taste the Difference and counter products which are outdoor bred will continue to be sourced from this farming system. I hope this answers your question.

Is that a catch-all excuse for applying nonsensical arbitrary 'rules' to be applied by officious employees?  I'm sorry, but the reason given is absolute nonsense and does not bear any logical scrutiny. The parent is the person responsible for looking after their child. Since when did it become the policy of a supermarket chain to dictate how a parent should (or indeed should not) look after their child? The security guard concerned should stick to stopping thieves, mind their own business and perhaps be more involved in customer service as happens in other countries.;2016-07-22T08:19:49+0000;2

The lovely lady who answered the phone and the other lovely lady in your TU clothing department.  So helpful and went out of their way for me.

She was very upset and tearful that the skirt I ordered from another retailer didn t fit.

I will not be back if this is the sloppy attitude you take as a company. I would point out that the store concerned at Fosse Park Leicester has 2 entrances and only 1 covered by a camera.

It was only 10.15 am  I told her she can put them back that I don t want them as they are advertised in the chiller for £11 she then got a lad that works there to put the cans back and to take the price tag off the front of the chiller......

EVERY thing we ordered was a 'suggested replacement!'  Ok so a year on after being a regular visitor to the weymouth store I decided to try the online shopping again ( maybe it's improved) my wife and I run seasonal businesses and we don't get time to shop.  The online shop would a) not recognise my nector card. B) took an age to fing the products I want even tho I search bar codes! C) after completing the shop it would not let me buy because I didn't put in my nector card! So my wife went to sainsburys instead today and guess what ! They only had 30 % of what we wanted.  Similar to last year ( we buy a lot of the same products) we placed an order. Well another fiasco! .......;2016-07-20T16:43:56+0000;0

I am not willing to talk to 'customer service' or 'resolution team' anymore, if we could join together and complain to Financial Standard Authority (FSA) and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) then it will stop them fooling and distressing people. I am certainly taking the legal route as my pet is suffering for 2 months now from life threatening disease and they are still 'deciding' wether to preauthorise her diagnosis....my pet has no history of illness and they are deliberately doing this to put us off. Worst pet insurance I have ever had, wish I stayed with Tesco. I am also involving media and BBC Watchdog to expose their real face.;2016-07-31T12:55:20+0000;1

We know there are works going on whilst you move things around. But workers using cutting saws whilst people are trying to shop  could have done it out of opening hours! Your prices have gone up rather sharply  a lot of products we picked up and put back again when we saw the prices. Then we went to the fridges and the stuff that was out of date on the day or just the next day was ridiculous. Hardly any bread and the bread that was there was going out of date with a day or two.

That way  shoppers who wish to buy British if possible could head there first  then fill in the gaps from the imported products. I appreciate that this would effectively need two produce departments  and might reduce sales of things like green beans from Africa  but could be an interesting experiment.

Maybe not. 😡 4  You checkout after spending another 20 minutes having to find alternatives to the full price expensive items now in your trolley.  5  On arrival one item you ordered wasn t available which is fine but after your driver has gone you notice your steak is out of date after today.

I ordered some travel money a couple of weeks ago and arranged to collect it from your store in Sprucefield on Tues 5th July. I live about 45 mins away from this store but i knew i would be in dublin that day and i could collect my travel money on my way home. I arrived at the store just after 5.30 (and i was in a real rush). much to my surprise i found the bureau closed with a sign saying it wouldnt be open again until 6pm. i couldnt wait until 6pm so i asked one of your checkout supervisors if anyone could serve me. The girl i spoke with was very nice. she told me the girl had gone on her tea but she would go upstairs and ask if she could come down. The girl from check out came back down again and said - im sorry shell be back at 6pm and no one else can serve you in the bureau. I told her i was in a rush and that i dont live near this store (i just wouldnt be able to get back here before my hols). she said she would go up again. A few mins later  Diane  arrived down with a face like thunder. I apologised to her and said i was in a rush and i just couldnt wait until 6pm. she barely acknowledged me - clearly not happy that i had interupted her dinner. she gave me my money and i was able to go on my way - but i was made to feel like a nuisance. your opening hours for the bureau say 9-8 or whatever the hrs are - they dont state  but we close for 1/2 hr when diane goes on her break so dont come at this time .

We’re really sorry for the experience you’ve had and thanks for the feedback, I’ll make sure this is passed on to the store. Sometimes we have to temporally close our bureaux to allow our staff breaks but completely understand that you shouldn’t have been made to feel this way. Do you have a Nectar card? If so can you DM us with the number and your postcode as we’d like give you some points as an apology. Thanks, Stephen;2016-07-19T11:50:00+0000;0

I m 37 weeks pregnant and suffering with this heat   let alone trying to do the weekly shop with a nearly 2 year old. This morning I was contemplating not going shopping and was very worried that I was now too pregnant to do the weekly shop! So I got myself together and made it out and was just about to attempt to get my son into the trolley when the store security guard appeared from nowhere and offered to help get my son into the trolley seat - really needed the help as he s rather heavy and I m rather huge at the moment! The security guard couldn t have arrived at a better time! She then helped push the trolley into the store. She even said to me to go find her when I needed help leaving the store. I didn t need to do this as yet again  like my guardian angel she appeared when I was at the checkout. She entertained my son whilst I packed and paid  then she walked me to my car where she unloaded my bags in to the boot and even got my son into his car seat. Honestly after the day I was having and how awful I was feeling  this amazing lady saved the day. She was truly lovely and I can not thank her enough for all the help she gave me. Sadly I didn t catch her name but I hope that she gets recognition for what she did today.;2016-07-18T12:03:14+0000;10155021745274377_10155021756364377;pageowner;0;I'm glad to hear you received such great service!

Please then explain the price of your Coca Cola (1.75L) range? It has been priced at £2.00 a bottle in your stores since April whilst at almost every other supermarket it is perpetually on offer at two bottles for £2.00. During the summer months my family usually get through four bottles of Coca Cola Zero a week. Despite your stores being very good in terms of customer service  availability and ambience I m not prepared to pay twice as much for products. Since brand match ended my weekly shop at your stores has reduced dramatically from £100 a week to around £20.;2016-07-18T00:41:50+0000;10155020395364377_10155021252219377;pageowner;0;Hi Pran, we can't comment on the pricing of other supermarkets items and while Brand Match was stopped in favor of lower prices and better promotions, we can't advise which lines would be affecting by this.

I was having a nightmare of a day   I was having an allergic reaction to a bite on my arm and had run in to the store to go to the pharmacy with my 6 month old baby. They advised I spoke to my doctor so I went back to my car to make the call. After a little wait I was able to speak with a doctor on the phone. The doctor recommended something else to take  so for speed I just lifted my baby out of her car seat and carried her in to the store and back to the pharmacy. By the time I got back to the front of the store there was a torrential downpour and it just didn t stop. I don t mind a bit of rain but this was a big storm and I didn t have anything I could put over my baby to protect her. I waited and waited with my baby in my arms but the rain showed no signs of stopping.  Jason spotted us and without saying anything to me  he went over to the customer service desk and the next thing I knew he was there by my side with an umbrella. He walked us back to our car.  He was our hero that day! I wanted to tell you how impressed I was with his kindness. It was impressive customer service to say the least and I hope Jason can be recognised for his efforts. Well done Sainsbury s and thank you again Jason 😀;2016-07-17T18:32:07+0000;10155019480019377_10155019792179377;pageowner;0;That's lovely feedback Matey!

I can confirm however that the chickens are fed an organic diet that meets organic diet regulations. I can also confirm the main ingredient in the diet is organic wheat, alongside other organic ingredients, making up a nutritionally balanced diet for the animals. We're still awaiting information on the exact ingredient list, and we'll update you here shortly once we have the information. Ryan.;2016-07-22T10:52:37+0000;1

Who live the same day to day struggles as my family and I do.  The stress of trying to manage life with small children is difficult enough for most people but it is only amplified when your child's health hinges on the small details that so many underestimate and assume you must be ""over protective"", ""picky"", ""fussy"" to even consider. When really it's just the necessary diligence to keep your child alive and so they do not have to suffer pain and illness on a daily bases.;2016-07-22T14:08:05+0000;1

Our buyer has advised that our birds are fed a diet which is usually a combination of wheat and soy, along with vitamins and minerals to ensure a balanced diet which meets nutritional requirements. Wheat is sometimes substituted for maize (corn) and soya substituted with beans or rapeseed meal as part of this balanced diet. Sadly, due to the two ingredients which can transfer to you via the meat, we would be unable to provide a chicken offering for the two of you as the two ingredients you are allergic to are fundamental to our bird's diet (regardless of the type of production). I hope this answers your question, and if there's anything else we can answer for you, let us know. Ryan.;2016-07-25T14:19:26+0000;1

They seem to greatly underestimate the difficulties we have as allergy parents, when knowing what's in your food can mean the difference between your child's quality of life and ultimately their lives too. They're also vastly over estimating the knowledge of health care professionals, and prescriptions; when the majority of the time they tell you you'll have to do the research yourself. With prescriptions only being available for a few who have certain allergies they are definitely not the norm. With the 600% increase in allergies (resulting in hospital admittance) in the UK in the last 20 years you'd hope that people would be less ignorant.  Our diets may be limited but at least we and our children are thriving.  I look forward to seeing Sainsbury's response 😊";2016-07-22T12:03:52+0000;2

You'll find an option to purchase by weight when viewing the item. On your order, you purchased two baby watermelon and one giant watermelon.

Firstly  parent and child parking facilities are constantly being taken up by people with no children what so ever  there are never any spaces and im not sure about everyone else with a bad back  but trying to squeeze through a door that you can open 5cm is hard enough  nevermind fitting a toddler into a seat through that space  not to mention having to walk across an unsafe carpark with said toddler because some boy racer  grumpy old mad with a nice car or middle aged woman believes they have the right to a space they dont need. ALSO. The staff smoking space happens to be right beside the parent and child parking spaces  when theres three or four people there it crowds the air around the outer spaces  smoke being one thing i shelter my child from  i believe noone else should crowd her lungs with smoke. And finally  whilst in your store at the  free from  section  i was just about to buy a bottle of gluten free soy sauce when i checked the ingredients and woahh  it contained gluten  there were two or three bottles missing from that box meaning that two or three people out there are seriously ill due to your (as your employee stated)  oh it must have just been put there by mistake  (without an apology)  So basically i just believe that anyone stacking a shelf that people trust not to poison them and completely destroy the vili in their small intestine should probably be trained to know not to put something there that will poison someone and completely destroy the villi in their small intestine.

We provide our parent and child spaces as a courtesy, and unfortunately they're not enforceable in the same way that disabled spaces are. However, we do have faith that our customers will use them appropriately, but please discuss this next time it happens as we can try to tackle repeat offender. It'll help us ensure these spaces are used appropriately. I'll certainly speak with the store manager regarding the colleague smoking area, as it shouldn't be affecting your visit to the store. Would you be able to confirm the brand of Soy sauce that was on the shelf? Our freefrom section contains products suited for a wide range of allergen requirements and isn't exclusively gluten-free, so I'd like to check into that as we should have the correct products displayed.

I've addressed your concerns with him over the telephone and he's going to look into what you mentioned with the smoking area. He also kindly had a walk around the store while on the call with me in order to correctly identify the product you mentioned. He's going to make sure that staff are aware of the difference to prevent this happening again. He also mentioned that if you have any concerns in future, please feel to ask for him on your next visit and he'll be more than happy to have a cup of tea and a chat with you. If he's not available, our Deputy Manager who is called Annette will also be happy to meet with you. I hope this helps! Ryan.;2016-07-16T15:12:35+0000;0

Its completely put me off shopping there. In the irvine branch the spaces are a biy further away but there is a safe walking route with a crossing. Most parents dont mind a bit of a walk as long as the kids are safe and there is space to get them into a car. Its unfortunately enforcable when susan with the convertable parked so close to the bright pink visible carseat that shes practically sitting in it and you open the door on her.  I cant remember the exact brand as it was whisked away so quick. The correct box was sitting behind it and the label below stated g/f soysauce. I get that mistakes can be made but there is a lot of trust put in that section by celiacs and one piece of gluten can set someone back a few weeks and cause a lot of pain. I believe it was teriyaki when the real stuff is tamari. The bottles did look pretty similar though;2016-07-16T08:46:36+0000;0

Think it was 25 or 26. I know it was right at the end. The space in front of the till where I would put my trolley to put stuff after its scanned had a trolley full of empty plastic boxes. Even by the windows there were trollies full of rubbish or shopping unattended. So much so that I had to actually move trolley and squeeze myself around it to put stuff in. Normally I won t mind but I had our 2 year old with me and it wasn t ideal at all. Worse was that there was no apology or any effort of making it easier for me by the lady at the till. In fact when I had to leave after paying  I had to reverse the distance of 5-6 tills before I could put the trolley in the right direction. It wasn t a pleasant experience at all. I must say I have had better experiences in the corner shops and don t expect supermarkets the kind of yourselves to have no consideration to it being a clean comfortable experience for the shoppers. I am a long-standing fan of your stores but felt very let down this time.;2016-07-14T17:38:05+0000;10155009869349377_10155010082014377;pageowner;0;I'm really sorry about that Shalini, did you speak to our instore colleagues about this?

Place was practically empty and still had to wait 30 minutes for them to warm up 2 paninis and cook a bowl of chips. When the food finally came we sent the chips back since my partner spotted them under the hot lights 10 minutes earlier.  Also overheard a member of staff asking another (who was on her break at the time) if there was anymore macaroni cheese. She replied that there was none in the kitchen but she should grab a  basics one  from one of the aisles.

All I wanted to know was if a UK bank card registered to where I live could be used to purchase and be delivered to a UK address, not really that complicated. M&S  Tesco and many other well known companies do. I just asked if Sainsbury's did. At no time did I  expect or ask you if you shipped to Greece.;2016-07-14T07:53:43+0000;0

Had you been less foolish and made sure the product had no lid upon leaving the store, we may have been able to help you. I hope you have leant a very valuable lesson today.

As you know our site in Sawston was formerly occupied by Barclay's Bank and we acquired their lease. We're keen to bring forward a new convenience store but unfortunately the construction works are more extensive than we first thought.  As a result we're reviewing our plans to make sure that the development is viable, meets local shopping needs and ultimately returns value to our shareholders.  We're going through this process at the moment and considering a number of future options for a store on the site. We know local people want to see the development happen and as soon as we're in a position to do so, we'll be back in touch with local residents.  In the meantime, your comments regarding the state of the building have been logged and passed onto our property team. Our contractors recently cleared the rubble, de-weeded and where possible repaired the broken windows and fencing. We'll ask them to revisit the site and ensure it's well maintained while we continue to develop our plans. Cheryl;2016-07-14T08:55:50+0000;0

I'm very sorry for the inconvenience caused and if your daughter can provide you with the receipt to send to us, or contacts us directly with it, we'll make sure to feed this back to the store manager. Please be aware though that we do operate a Think 25 policy in our stores and we train our colleagues to ask for identification if there is any reasonable doubt to a customers age. It is the law, and we would expect our colleagues to refuse the sale of an age-restricted product if they feel that the identification presented may possible be fake or borrowed.

I want to ask if you can please do something about the HUGE amount of FOOD WASTE that is happening in this country in your stores.  I know that you do Basics range and I buy these products all the time but when it comes to fruit and vegetables  the main products that are thrown away before they even reach the store  I want to see more of these being sold in Sainsburys stores. I don t mind using wonky and mishapen fruit and vegetables in my cooking. That s just it. When I cook  I tend to chop up the ingredients so who cares what they looked like to start with?  I want to use fresh  British grown food. I want to pay a reasonable price for my food.  I also don t want to have to buy LARGE bags of food that I end up throwing away either because they contain too much for a single person to use in a week. There are thousands of Sainsburys customers like me who want to see these products on the store shelves. So please Sainsburys. Listen to us. We DO CARE about our food and the MASSIVE amount of food that is wasted in this country.;2016-07-12T11:58:54+0000;10155002429294377_10155002436584377;pageowner;0;Hi Shirley, we’re always looking at ways to reduce waste, find out more here: http://bit.ly/1WU6R9Y.

We work hard to utilize our grower's crops and our strategy is to sell the smaller sized fruits in pre-packs and sell the larger fruits as loose. Larger fruits typically attract higher prices because larger fruits take up more space so therefore the cost to transport and store is more. Stephen";2016-07-19T13:22:53+0000;0

Nectar cards are linked to specific stores ('home store') to prevent fraud. However, you can spend your points in any of our stores. If you visit a different store, a colleague should have offered you the Nectar workaround. This would involve you answering some security questions with Nectar over the phone. You can then spend your points there and then. I assume the colleague didn't offer this to you? Thanks, Naomi.;2016-07-12T11:28:48+0000;0

I went in after doing some painting at my daughters school tonight to grab some sweets for her classmates as its her birthday tomorrow (and some new leggings as mind had seen better days) grabbed said leggings and headed for the sweets. Grabbed a large bag of mini haribo packs and thought I d get a couple of the 10p bags just to boost the numbers a little bit.

Had I of not noticed my daughter would have been dishing these out  and had  God forbid  one child a broke a tooth or choked I would be the one to blame  as the parent  not you as the company!!! I would have been the irresponsible one!!! I took the entire box down to customer services  told the girl there and her face said a picture of disbelief herself!! She grabbed a fellow colleague (Jason/James) who took me back to the sweets  he then scooped up other 10p haribo bags of different varieties and we ended up carrying every single box down to customer services as he had found MORE out of date in different boxes from 12/2015 as well!!!   I am horrified as a parent  we can say to our kids  oh just grab a bag  to which they hold onto for the entire time  maybe without us giving it a once over  at which no point would any parent probably think of checking the date on a packet of these!!!! It s a bag of haribo.   Another colleague Leanne came and could understand completely what I was saying as she has children herself. She was mortified!! She very kindly gave me the sweets free (the ones in date!) and a £10 gift card. Very nice of her to do so  but I was buying leggings for this price so essentially it outweighed itself! She said that is the only the most that SHE could do.

Which is fine. My post is more about the the children, my children and her friends. I did not mention anything about wanting something, just stating the point that happened. For your information the leggings were £10 themselves and I was paying for them anyway. I didn't kick up a fuss in anyway, it was the best that she could do, which I mentioned and very kind to do so. I payed for the leggings myself, and not with the £10 gift card. Like I said if it was something for me I wouldn't have been too bothered at all, but when your sending your child into school on their birthday with sweets, for the first time,past their sell by date by nearly a year then that would have been my fault.;2016-07-12T09:24:14+0000;0

I went in after doing some painting at my daughters school tonight to grab some sweets for her classmates as its her birthday tomorrow (and some new leggings as mind had seen better days) grabbed said leggings and headed for the sweets. Grabbed a large bag of mini haribo packs and thought I d get a couple of the 10p bags just to boost the numbers a little bit. Now  these 10p haribo bags  on display  box opened  many had been bought  so I grabbed a handful and thought they felt funny  a bit hard  I wondered if I had picked up the wrong ones and they weren t  I checked the box behind and they were nice and soft  so went back to the ones I was holding  all the colours looked a bit off  a bit shrivelled and they were rock hard!! So I looked at the date and to my astonishment they were 08/2015!!!!! NEARLY A YEAR OUT OF DATE!!! Sweets for children  for toddlers!! Had I of not noticed my daughter would have been dishing these out  and had  God forbid  one child a broke a tooth or choked I would be the one to blame  as the parent  not you as the company!!! I would have been the irresponsible one!!! I took the entire box down to customer services  told the girl there and her face said a picture of disbelief herself!! She grabbed a fellow colleague (Jason/James) who took me back to the sweets  he then scooped up other 10p haribo bags of different varieties and we ended up carrying every single box down to customer services as he had found MORE out of date in different boxes from 12/2015 as well!!!   I am horrified as a parent  we can say to our kids  oh just grab a bag  to which they hold onto for the entire time  maybe without us giving it a once over  at which no point would any parent probably think of checking the date on a packet of these!!!! It s a bag of haribo.   Another colleague Leanne came and could understand completely what I was saying as she has children herself. She was mortified!! She very kindly gave me the sweets free (the ones in date!) and a £10 gift card. Very nice of her to do so  but I was buying leggings for this price so essentially it outweighed itself! She said that is the only the most that SHE could do.  So my point is  walking out tonight I felt sorry for any kids that have had to endure a packet of these  probably without the parents even knowing  and with the dangers that could have arose from this  and that actually what is just a £10 gift card?? You would have been putting many children in the hands of your poor stock checking/rotation  that were nearly an entire year out of date and with that there is no excuse  and actually a £10 gift card doesn t just make what happened tonight go away!

A £10 gift card doesn't make what happened tonight go away as I could of potentially of caused harm to other people's children had I of not not noticed and I would have felt awful for that and that doesn't make that feeling go away when walking out the door. But I'm thankful for the fact that I did notice. The situation could have been so much different for me. The point of the post is to highlight the fact that there is a problem, and that our children mean the world to us and not wanting any harm towards them, something that needs to be looked into on how staff actually check these boxes with multiple bags in;2016-07-12T09:43:11+0000;0

Had I of not noticed my daughter would have been dishing these out  and had  God forbid  one child a broke a tooth or choked I would be the one to blame  as the parent  not you as the company!!! I would have been the irresponsible one!!! I took the entire box down to customer services  told the girl there and her face said a picture of disbelief herself!! She grabbed a fellow colleague (Jason/James) who took me back to the sweets  he then scooped up other 10p haribo bags of different varieties and we ended up carrying every single box down to customer services as he had found MORE out of date in different boxes from 12/2015 as well!!!   I am horrified as a parent  we can say to our kids  oh just grab a bag  to which they hold onto for the entire time  maybe without us giving it a once over  at which no point would any parent probably think of checking the date on a packet of these!!!! It s a bag of haribo.   Another colleague Leanne came and could understand completely what I was saying as she has children herself. She was mortified!! She very kindly gave me the sweets free (the ones in date!) and a £10 gift card. Very nice of her to do so  but I was buying leggings for this price so essentially it outweighed itself!

Grabbed a large bag of mini haribo packs and thought I d get a couple of the 10p bags just to boost the numbers a little bit.

Had I of not noticed my daughter would have been dishing these out  and had  God forbid  one child a broke a tooth or choked I would be the one to blame  as the parent  not you as the company!!! I would have been the irresponsible one!!! I took the entire box down to customer services  told the girl there and her face said a picture of disbelief herself!! She grabbed a fellow colleague (Jason/James) who took me back to the sweets  he then scooped up other 10p haribo bags of different varieties and we ended up carrying every single box down to customer services as he had found MORE out of date in different boxes from 12/2015 as well!!!   I am horrified as a parent  we can say to our kids  oh just grab a bag  to which they hold onto for the entire time  maybe without us giving it a once over  at which no point would any parent probably think of checking the date on a packet of these!!!! It s a bag of haribo.   Another colleague Leanne came and could understand completely what I was saying as she has children herself. She was mortified!! She very kindly gave me the sweets free (the ones in date!) and a £10 gift card. Very nice of her to do so  but I was buying leggings for this price so essentially it outweighed itself!

This week I logged in to add a couple of things to this week's regular shop only to find that there's no mention at all of my regular shop on the site and no option to set it up again. This is extremely frustrating - where has it gone?  It's taken me weeks to get it just right and now it's disappeared altogether. I also had the same problem as you, I spent ages on the phone and the technical  team weren't able to resolve it.  Add to this the seemingly ever increasing number of items that aren't available and I wonder if it's time to try another supermarket.;2016-07-19T20:28:48+0000;0

You ve packed so much on to the shelfs it looks a mess. There is a wall of fizzy drinks.. why? The sweets/chocolate/crisps have been spread all over the place. I actually hate going in now  i find my self walking around trying to figure out whats what. Now to mention the prices ... why have they gone up??  The choice thats there  it is shocking. The sandwich meat selection consists of ham. Thats it  7 differnt packs/styles of the same ham. And it doesnt matter if its 5 slices or 10 its £1.60 how can you justify that?! Who ever decided these changes needs firing. Seriously its shocking. Theres a price difference between the  local  in wigston magna and the one here. A plastic cup in the one here is £1.99 the same one is £1.50 in the other. I know this because i assumed i could get it closer to home.. i refuse to pay more for the same bloody thing.;2016-07-11T17:44:10+0000;10155000336099377_10155000403519377;pageowner;0;Hi Jennifer!

The chicken itself is injected with a brine (containing Water, Salt, Brown Sugar, Stabilisers: Sodium Triphosphate, Disodium Diphosphate, Tetrasodium Diphosphate, Sodium Polyphosphate; Dextrose) on site to ensure that the chicken does not dry out on the rotisserie or during hot holding in store, a process where we keep the chicken warm ready to serve in store. The product itself contains no peanuts and the site which produces this product is a nut free site. No other chicken products contain nuts on the food to go hot counter.

At 12.05 I received a call (voicemail) to tell me that the driver was ill and that our shopping wouldn t be delivered today but tomorrow instead. My partner called back and managed to re-arrange for between 8 and 9 this evening. It s now 10.25 and we have no shopping delivery and no phone call to explain or apologise. What should I do now as I will be cancelling the transaction with my credit card company if this isn t resolved to my satisfaction. Also  will all of my fresh groceries be re-selected as they have probably been sitting in the back of a can all day...?!

I took the car in to fill up on diesel but several of your pumps were off  limiting me to one of the few that were still on this afternoon at 2pm.  I tried to put £30 of fuel in the tank  to last me all week  but when I tried to squeeze the pump it kept clicking off. I tried different position but no joy  so  after several minutes of trying and only getting just over 6 litres of diesel  I gave up and went to pay for the little your pump had graced me with.  I told the cashier there was a fault with the pump  and she told me they had previously reported it  which was good enough for me  then the woman on the other till rudely stuck her beak in and told me it was my car at fault causing the problem  and that the  petrol sensor must be faulty on your car  being the reason. Having been in work for several hours on a Sunday morning I wasn t in the cheeriest of moods anyway  but to have such a rudely worded and frankly ridiculous comment  frankly irritated me and it took every ounce of what little patience I had left to walk out without voicing my unhappiness. But I ve been ruminating on this since and thought  actually  you should be informed of this mockery of customer service. You see Sainsburys  yes my car is reasonably new  but it s not top of the range  but I have to say Im disappointed I didnt get the car with the spec that included bluetooth communication between petrol (despite it being diesel) tank and swanky sentient fuel pump at the supermarket. How wonderful it would have been to have that ability  now I m upset my car isnt like everyone elses.

I was forced to take my custom to a rival supermarket where my custom is more valued and they actually want to sell things to me.;2016-07-10T14:55:47+0000;10154997194764377_10154999673784377;37a8cce057094c0b51a724dbf1a926a9553359f2;1;Thank you.

Shopping with my toddler half way through the shop it s obviously a great time to poop  only I ve left his nappies & wipes in the car! My bad  but I m thinking it s cool all supermarkets offer nappies & wipes for these kind of situations right! WRONG!!!! As if asking the lady working wasn t painful enough as she completely didn t understand my simple request for a nappy & wipes but just disregard the request answering me with the fact they don t provide emergency nappy kits and she s never heard of this and quite simply nothing she could do! Fair enough I understand if you don t have a baby your not going to use supermarket baby changing facilities  but I d like to point out to Sainsbury that both Asda and Tesco offer nappies & wipes which are available from customer services should you need them. I had to abandoned my shopping trolly to go back to my car and change my little one who obviously comes first and went off to redo my shop in Asda where they are more baby friendly!!;2016-07-10T14:37:35+0000;10154997161334377_10154997564559377;4e7c87f1c8772b67de81a0b8c8b4d0d598d1c305;0;My 18 month daughter decided half way round Asda was the perfect time to vomit up her lunch. Not only did staff immediately set about cleaning up without making me feel like the worlds worst customer, they provided me with wipes, a cloth and a new t shirt and leggings free of charge. I could not believe how nice and understand they were. I've never been in a similar situation in my local sainsbury's so can't comment on how they would handle it but asda were superb.;2016-07-10T17:28:00+0000;0

Our colleagues in store are trained to keep the public in store safe in the matter of an emergency however any acts of physical violence should be a police matter and with the security provided in store so, I'm sorry that they never acted as quickly as they perhaps should have. This is something I'll certainly feed back to the store manager to allow them to provide better service in the future. Can you confirm the time you were in store?

Staff standing around talking while customers wait and wait to pay. Ended up on self scan  crowded as normal  and when waiting for alchohol approval  waited and waited and waited. Guy on duty rushing around but more interested in clearing baskets and getting cutomers on to empty tills. After >5mins of being ignored and having him walk away several time I left the goods on the scanner and left the store in utter disgust.  It s about time the management staff were in attendance Frifday and Saturday eveinings and witness how bad things get.  Fortunately Tesco had what I wanted.

If you took a poll of customer opinion i think you may find that the vast majority of customers[being sensible people mainly]would be very much against any policy which resulted in perfectly good food being wasted. I think that this group of people would also have more respect and loyalty for sainsbury s if you were more up-front and honest about current levels of waste and how you propose to improve this in the near future.It s not Rocket Science we are expecting it s good old common sense and moral responsibility! Could i suggest that you speak to Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall or at the very least watch his  Hugh s war on waste series which has quite a few home truths and not a few pretty good ideas on how things can be improved fairly simply. Perhaps you could let your customers know what you plan to do in the immediate future and long term about wasted food?

We primarily source our product from the UK whenever we can however we sometimes need to source them from other places in the world due to various factors (increased demand, weather constraints, etc). 90% of all our organic potatoes, apples, carrots and onions are sourced directly from the UK along with 100% of our eggs, milk, pork, lamb, beef and chicken. We're working hard to primarily source from the UK and will continue to do so whenever we can. Ryan.;2016-08-24T14:58:26+0000;0

Noticed in Sainsburys last night they had runner beans on offer at £2/lb.  Two pounds for a pound of runner beans and that's a reduced price!!!! Not only that but they were from bloody Kenya for goodness sake.   There's a bloke not three miles away from the shop who grows better beans and is content at 60p/lb if he could just find someone to buy them.   This country is a bit messed up with where it gets its food from and what it pays for it. How can it make sense to have beans from Kenya at that price while the man in the field next door can't find a buyer at a third of that price?

Now I want to know when  Sainsbury’s will report on how many tonnes of food waste you are saving with your Basics range  and the percentage of its farmers’ crops you are accepting or rejecting? We need meaningful action to tackle the estimated 3 million tonnes of food wasted on farms!  Aldi claim that since introducing their Everyday Essentials potatoes in January 2014  they have sold over 34 000 tonnes of potatoes which would have otherwise fallen outside of their specifications for being the wrong size  shape or colour  which has increased their potato suppliers crop use by over 17%.

Please be assured that no customer who fills up at one of our petrol stations is overcharged. When a customer returned the nozzle to the pump, this movement may cause a bit more fuel to pass into the flexible rubber hose. UK petrol pumps measure fuel to the nearest 0.01 litre and with current fuel prices this movement is something enough to add another 1p to the fuel calculator. The next customer at this pump will receive this small amount of extra fuel, in the same way that the current customer received the previous customer's at the start of their delivery.  We realise that our customers sometimes aim to fill up to an exact value and apologise for any inconvenience this may cause. Hose dilation as this is known, is recognised across all fuel retailers in the UK and is not unique to Sainsbury's. As required by the law, independent experts regularly check the accuracy of our pumps to ensure they are within the allowed limits of the Weights and Measures legislation.

I was brought up in a time where waste just didn't happen, everything was used so I don't understand the modern thinking of ""if it doesn't look perfect then throw it away"".

I got one at 3.15am yesterday which woke myself and my husband up.  My husband has to get up for work at 4.30am and I have sleep issues as it is because of back problems so neither of us got back to sleep.  As well as this I woke up in a panic thinking that something was wrong as I would only ever get phone calls or texts on my mobile during the night if there was a problem with family as it s the emergency contact number.  Although I did phone customer services and I was told they would alert IT I really don t think it s good enough and it has put me off ordering anything again.  To be honest if it wasn t for the fact that I really liked the item I ordered and couldn t find a similar one elsewhere I would have just cancelled the order there and then.

If not, I can provide you with the returns address or you can pop it back into one of our stores which accept clothing returns. You may be able to find an alternative size in store?

Following yesterday s visit to your Macclesfield store  please could you explain why it is so difficult to obtain a correct VAT receipt? We waited 20 minutes for this document yesterday  only for the values to be incorrect! This is the third time I have had to get replacement VAT receipts  as the values were incorrect. Your staff do not seem to be correctly trained in this area. A VAT receipt is an extremely import document  and submitting an incorrect one to HMRC could lead to over claiming back VAT  which is fraud. When I spoke to the store on the phone today  I was asked to bring the receipt back (in my time and at my expense) to correct their mistake. I politely declined and persuaded then to post me the replacement.  I look forward to your response  Andy Mann;2016-07-07T08:40:03+0000;10154987258374377_10154987709864377;pageowner;0;Hi there, I'm very sorry about this!

I am shocked to learn how much food is not accepted from farms and factories. As a customer I would appreciate cheaper  not perfect  food especially post Brexit when it feels crucial to step up and support UK farmers and factories in every way we can. Surely it makes economic sense to Sainsburies too to have as much local food as possible and less imports.

It's hard enough being a new mum even at 6 months. They do have I baby changing room but it's bearly big enough to get in with just baby and yourself. The restaurant did offer hot water but I wouldn't be allowed to move it from where they serve you. I could not heat his food with hot water it needed to be microwaved or heated in a pan. Maybe you could put I microwave out so mums can heat the baby food themselves? Along with bottle warmers? I felt embarrassed and disappointed as other supermarkets have all been so helpful and accommodating 😢;2016-07-06T14:43:58+0000;0

Took our shop back to the boat and carried on our journey to Fradley Junction - The middle of nowhere!   For the first night we bought a pizza and some TTD Rustic chips. This was a mistake. Followed the cooking instructions for the chips and pizza. They went in our little calogas oven. The pizza cooked beautifully and in the recommended time.   The chips on the other hand -  were still raw potato. An hour later - still raw potato. finally after an hour and a half they started to brown - at the edges. The edges quickly turned black - while the middle of the chips were still raw potato. After nearly 2 hours we decided to eat what we had. Some were cooked through - some weren t.   To our horror - they were disgusting. Sweet  horrible - tasted almost like carrots. We threw them straight in the bin and went to bed hungry.

Would like to say a huge thank you to the lovely lady from customer services  on oxney road in Peterborough   who returned my baby s blanket (I say blanket  it s more like a chewed up rag which could have easily been mistaken for rubbish) today  it s his absolute pride and joy and we wouldn t have slept tonight if it hadn t had been returned so safely. I didn t catch her name - but she was so accommodating and understanding.

We don't class items as short life if they have more than 24 hours left on their best before dates.

I have had my shopping delivered for several years now but this morning for the first time your driver completely exceeded expectations and went above and beyond his work. I suffer from rheumatoid disease and early mornings are particularly bad for my joints  your driver identified the struggle I had and offered to bring my shopping through to the kitchen but also unpacked the crates near the appropriate storage  meaning I did not have to struggle with carrying bags unnecessarily. He took the time to talk to me about my condition and made sure everything was accessible for me. He was polite  courteous and an asset to your company. Please pass on my thanks and gratitude. Unfortunately I was unable to see his name but hopefully you can trace him from my order number.  Regards Amy Westgate (Johnson)  Quarry wood store  aylesford.

I have had my shopping delivered for several years now but this morning for the first time your driver completely exceeded expectations and went above and beyond his work. I suffer from rheumatoid disease and early mornings are particularly bad for my joints  your driver identified the struggle I had and offered to bring my shopping through to the kitchen but also unpacked the crates near the appropriate storage  meaning I did not have to struggle with carrying bags unnecessarily. He took the time to talk to me about my condition and made sure everything was accessible for me. He was polite  courteous and an asset to your company. Please pass on my thanks and gratitude.

Our customers’ safety and wellbeing are of paramount importance to us, so we know how crucial it is that all our products are prepared and packaged to the highest of standards. We perform regular checks with our suppliers to ensure these standards are being met and that a good safety record is maintained. Unfortunately, without having the opportunity to examine a sample of the food you ate, we cannot say whether this product was at fault. Symptoms of food poisoning can take up to ten days to develop and can be caused by anything you've eaten during that time. We're also aware that some people can be sensitive to certain ingredients and that, on occasion, reactions can be immediate. Have you sought medical advice yet? Chris.;2016-07-03T10:45:04+0000;0

I wanted to bring to your attention an outstanding member of staff you gave  Ann- Marie who works in Kelso in the Scottish Borders. Every Saturday night we get deli pizzas for us and the kids for a family movie night  the kids really enjoy this. My daugther is 10 and likes mushroom pizza which is not one of the standard pre- made varieties. We have been asking for  one and having it made up while we shop.  Over the last few weeks Anne Marie has automatically made this up for my daugther and placed aside in the fridge  without fail - even if she is on her break  when we arrive and my daugther requests her pizza  like today there was already one done as she knows we do this every weekend.

My daugther is 10 and likes mushroom pizza which is not one of the standard pre- made varieties. We have been asking for  one and having it made up while we shop.  Over the last few weeks Anne Marie has automatically made this up for my daugther and placed aside in the fridge  without fail - even if she is on her break  when we arrive and my daugther requests her pizza  like today there was already one done as she knows we do this every weekend.  Quite amazing  she does this every week and makes a 10 year old girl very happy!!

Apparently on that day I exceeded the time  allowed  by 21 minutes  for which I have been sent a fine of £70!! Oh sorry  reduced to £30 if I pay by 12th July. I admit I knew of the time limit but also did not exactly track it. I would be happy to pay for parking but choosing this manner of imposing parking restrictions is a very bad move in my opinion; I d like to point out that on that day I met an old friend at the store for some lunch as it is a convenient place for us both. I spent £15 on food and drink and then after we had parted I  went back into the store and chose some bedding for my father  chose some home improvement magazines and had to ask the pharmacist for advice for some tablets I needed.  After all this I had to wait a few minutes to pay as there were only 2 checkouts open and personally I like to pay a person who will say thank you  rather than use a self service machine. After all this I left straight away. I spent over £85 in the store that day. Also I  spent a similar amount in another branch that same week. You set out your stores to encourage people to browse and linger and spend time and money and then choose to have your parking spaces controlled by greedy 3rd parties rather than choosing fair means of control which would not upset good customers.

The point I was trying to make to the Burpham store was that it was reduced and the the ticket was still on the shelf (no end of offer date) and that's why I decided to buy it. That's why I felt it was wrong. I was in there at roughly 3pm ish. Perhaps you would message me directly as for some reason I have a following of keyboard warriors.
