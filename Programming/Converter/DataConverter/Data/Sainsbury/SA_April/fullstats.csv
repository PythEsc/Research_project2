During a weekly delivery  the delivery person has acted completely in appropriately with aggression and contempt. She has completely lost all sense of values and professionalism. On my own doorstep I been accused of lying about the fact that I find it hard to hear  told that Sainsbury s will never again deliver to my address as it s a health and safety issue (due to us living on a country lane which doesn t seem to have been a problem for the past 7 years of weekly deliveries)  berated for allowing my 17 year old son for writing his name on the machine ( although this has been fine with all other drivers over the past years as I always actually sign it) and refused to give me my receipt. I have been shouted at and abused. Despite the store manager responding very well and providing reassurance and despite having really good service up to now  I m not sure we want to carry on with our weekly shop with Sainsbury s. I m concerned that this could have happened to a vulnerable person on their doorstep. I m not vulnerable and I have been shocked and disturbed by this incident.;;;;;2016-04-30T18:03:10+0000;1462039390;2016-04-30 20:03:10;0;7;0;0;7;7;6;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

After being allocated a slot at 2pm to get my shopping delivery  the driver turning up an hour before without previous warning  I find out that a whole crate of my shopping is missing!! I reluctantly agreed to get the rest of my shopping redelivered tomorrow as advised by the driver. Not having had a confirmation email  text or phone call confirming the new delivery slot for Sunday  I decided to ring costumer service to get it from them. You can imagine how surprised I was when I learnt that Sainsbury s had no intention of redeliver and they were going to process a refund. They just forgot to inform the costumer of this very important information! You can imagine that I am a lot less than impressed with the communication and the overall costumer service. After being a loyal costumer for many years I will definitely have to rethink were to shop from now!

I went to the store I shop in on Tuesday at around 7 and every single special offer was removed from the shelves and fridges  ready to be replaced with the new offers. Why can this not be done in sections around the store? I  like many others  rely on these offers to keep my shopping down and to provide variety in my shop that I could not otherwise afford.;;;;;2016-04-29T07:42:14+0000;1461915734;2016-04-29 09:42:14;1;6;1;0;7;6;2;4;3;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

This is the email you guys sent me. If this is the case i dont want the products. I rather spend my money else where. I just wanted to try the products to see if my family and i like them.  Dear Skye   Thanks for taking the time to contact us.   It s disappointing that the voucher for the promotional free items as advised on our website didn t redeem at the correct price on your order. I can appreciate that these evouchers offer a chance to try new products that you may not have tried before  so I can understand your concern that on this occasion the correct offer hasn t been taken of your order. I m sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.   I can confirm  for each promotional offer  under the terms and conditions  it states that there is a limited amount of products that can be given for free. They need to be redeemed within a time limit or until all samples have been redeemed. Additionally  it states  that it isn‚Äôt valid in conjunction with any offer  subject to availability while stocks last and one free sample per account.    As you‚Äôve a number of free promotional items on your order this is causing a technical error and the vouchers won‚Äôt redeem at the correct amount.   You can find the terms of each promotion by clicking on the  +  icon just under the redemption instructions.   If you require further assistance  please reply to this email or contact us on 0800 328 1700 selecting option 1  then option 1 again and we ll be happy to help.     We appreciate the time you‚Äôve taken to contact us and we look forward to seeing you online shortly.

Why don t you have this for diabetics? My four year old boy is on a diabetic diet  not because he has diabetes but his bladder is allergic to sugar.   The problem I am finding is... It s a huge shock to suddenly have no sugar in a diet but how awful it is trying to find products he can have... Today after spending hours in our sainsburys store with my 4 year old and 1 year old getting very grumpy I came across a fantastic hot chocolate suitable for diabetics.... Along with sugar free lollies... But why can they not be more obvious... Along with a diabetics jam. The other thing I notice is these products are low to the floor... Again not a huge issue for me but hardly makes finding new products easier but people with diabetes may have mobility issues or struggle bending etc. I appreciate these may not be the best sellers in store but with diabetes on the rise could you not do more to support people?   Many thanks  a very stressed out mum after a very long time in your store.  Zoe;;;;;2016-04-28T10:25:48+0000;1461839148;2016-04-28 12:25:48;8;16;8;2;26;16;13;3;15;0;8;0;0;0;0;0;0

One of her children was very  busy   chatting with staff  playing with his new ball & I imagine this mum found it difficult to get on with matters in hand. A short while later I saw her children with a basket & the security guard. He had taken the children to do some of the shopping so the mum could get on with the rest of her shopping. I just wanted to say how refreshing this was. Often the security guards just stand at the door  chat to staff or stroll around the shop doing what they need to. He did a brilliant job  even checking what type of squash the lady wanted.

It was a brand that only Sainsbury s sell. As I wasn t happy with the problems with the TV I decided to try a different brand of TV in exchange (it was Panasonic). The TV I got in replacement was actually more expensive but was happy to pay the difference. I was told that because of the TV being a replacement I cannot return the Panasonic TV to the store if a fault occurs and is non-refundable. Unfortunately for me the TV has in fact developed a fault and want to know what my rights are as I would like to return the TV as I am very unhappy it isn t working correctly  I haven t had it very long. I still have the receipt. All I would like is an exchange. Surely I still have a right to do this? Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.;;;;;2016-04-25T14:49:03+0000;1461595743;2016-04-25 16:49:03;0;4;0;0;4;4;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I parked up  left him in the car while I went to fetch the trolley and halfway back to the car discovered the clips were broken. Thankfully this was spotted before I had unloaded his wheelchair from the car  and transferred him into the trolley. On reporting the broken seat to customer services I was told it had already been reported and they were waiting for someone to fix it. If this was the case  why was a broken trolley left out for customer use? Surely a note could have been put on it  or it could be stored away from public access until OT was mended. I am very disappointed. I now have to travel to another store to be able to shop with my son and will think twice before visiting this one again. This issue has still not been resolved.

The Waterlane collection point has been built  across  the length of two two car parking spaces.  This means that a car can pull in next to the van and has space to unpack crates and pack shopping at the rear of their vehicle.  Yesterday another customer pulled in right behind me shouting obscenities at me in front of my son  and refusing to allow me any space to pack my shopping.  His argument was that there are two  *king parking spaces here  move forward you ** . there  was very little the older Sainsburys worker could do. It is also patently obvious that having ONE van  and ONE driver must mean that only ONE customers groceries can be dealt with at a time!  My son and I managed to throw our shopping in the boot of the car  whilst tripping over our own feet and the bonnet of the young mans car and got out as quickly as we could.  This young mans aggression towards a middle aged woman and and a 12 year old boy has left us both very shaken  and we returned to the store to register a complaint. The design of this click and collect point should have clarification that only one vehicle can comfortably be accommodated at a time  and a policy should be in place to deal with harassment of a customer by another customer.  In the meantime  i m afraid I will  have to resort to having my groceries delivered. I also  have no option but to reconsider who my delivery provider will be.;;;;;2016-04-24T13:11:40+0000;1461503500;2016-04-24 15:11:40;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

It s in the bin  which is quite frankly a mercy for ourselves and the poor bird. I don t know what was done to this feathered unfortunate  but it must have been horrific. What little flesh we managed to scrape of it s pitiful carcass tasted like it had been marinated in fairy liquid (i checked  and it hadn t) but it didn t even look like duck. If Hannibal Lecter had been a duck  he d have looked at this sorry specimen and said   do you know what? I feel like a salad . It wasn t just disgusting  I d even go so far as to call it  foul   although describing this winged refugee from the Isle of Dr Moreaux as fowl would be the most misleading statement since Judas Iscariot said  hey Jesus  let s go out and get hammered . In other news  we saut√©ed some Sainsbury s potatoes too. Don t get me started on them. The cabbage was alright though. Well done Sainsbury s. You do great cabbage. Although quite frankly  in future  I d rather eat one of the ex-Secret Service henchmen that you get to jealously guard the precious 5p carrier bags than one of the formerly feathered atrocities you see fit to pass off as ducks.;;;;;2016-04-22T21:21:54+0000;1461360114;2016-04-22 23:21:54;1;6;1;0;7;6;3;3;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

As my dad bought a couple of packets from there and it was gone off we went to the store today and the manager josh stated that it could of been air bubbles in the packet and that s probably why it went off he then exchanged it for another two packets of your mince meat that didn t have no air bubbles...

I appreciate that this needs to be done  and that later in the day is less likely to cause disruption.   However  barging in front of me while I m walking towards it with a heavy basket is simply rude. I m sure that waiting a couple of minutes would have seen the checkout unused by customers.

Bought a hot southern fried chicken sandwich yesterday morning which was cold went back in spoke to a guy that was very helpful he swapped it and I left. Opened the sandwich outside store was cold again  (a health and safety issues in its self) went back in the same guy was there started speaking with him. Another assistant came up and said   You can t just take a bite out of our food and put it back because you don t like it!!  I explained I d paid for it and that it was cold but she didn t believe me I said I was going to the till to get a refund.  (I d used the self checkout machine didn t give reciept) luckily I paid by card and used my nectar card. The rude assistant called a supervisor and spoke to her privately. She came out and gave me attitude and tufted at me when I explained again that the machine didn t give me a reciept. At the this point the rude assistant had taken my paid for sandwich off me. As I was walking over to the till I said to the supervisor I was upset that the assistant had accused me of taking a bite out of the sandwich without paying for it. She said we ll you should pay for it first then asked me for the receipt.  At this point I not only felt hugely embarrassed but angry to and asked her if she had listened to a word I said. She then started going on about my attitude. This is a total disgrace and I will never use this store again. I spoke with the customer services who took my number am still waiting to hear back.  I hope now one else ever gets accused of something like this in front of other people it s the most humiliating thing ever I even had another customer shout out about me being moody and unhappy cause I couldn t get hot food!!!!!;;;;;2016-04-22T06:16:16+0000;1461305776;2016-04-22 08:16:16;2;86;2;1;89;84;21;63;108;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I m aware that W******e  is in the process of rolling out a similar app which will run alongside it s in store self scan hand held units.

I filled up my 2015  recently serviced VW Polo  which already  had a 1/4 of a tank full of petrol.  The capacity of a Polo tank is 45L.  When I went into the petrol station it showed that I had filled up with 45.5L  I queried this with the member of staff who was unable to offer any explanation so I paid and then once I got home I called the store.  I was put through to a Manager- I am happy to provide his name via PM- and explained the situation.  To my surprise I was told  It is impossible  my petrol gauge must be faulty  petrol prices have gone up recently  I used to be a service station manager and this has never happened  maybe the tank is bigger than the manufacturer says  and a variety of other similar comments.  At no point was my complaint taken seriously  nor did he even consider taking details of the pump I used to check it.  Perhaps you could assist with this further seeing as Sainbury s Harlow have no intention of doing so.

On a number of occasions over the last few months I thought I was buying clearance food as it had flags on  only to get to checkouts to find it full price. I ve ended up buying it anyway as I don t have a lot of time on my breaks to go back and sort out. I m sure the staff do it on purpose  why wouldn t they offer good customer service and say  you are aware those ones are full price  but no they put all the meat in one tray and put a clearance flag on it. Today I brought two cooked breast fillets  they were all sub standard and dry in the tray so I once again I though they all must be half price and brought two  only to be charge full price again. This might sound like an insane idea but how about segregating the clearance from the full priced food!.......;;;;;2016-04-19T16:45:03+0000;1461084303;2016-04-19 18:45:03;0;5;0;0;5;5;2;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Why would you explicitly exclude the one thing that is DEFINITELY going to be included in the cost?

First we were delivered the wrong shop  the delivery guy had us confused with someone else in the street.  When we had ours  there was no apparent short date or issues. Shop was apparently all fine. When we were going through the shop to put away we noticed that the cucumber was all soft  the lettuce had all residue and water in bottom of bag. The tomatoes were short dated along with mushrooms and strawberries. The bananas were already turning brown. The mince we ordered was short dated and packaging was starting to blow out already. Generally a disgusting shop that nearly cost around ¬£75 or more.  When we noticed this we emailed you. Sunday I had to throw all the fresh above out. I have emailed you again since and received no reply.  We are extremely disappointed and will not be using your online services again.;;;;;2016-04-19T07:23:50+0000;1461050630;2016-04-19 09:23:50;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Your  fast track  checkouts  they are for those who have scanned their shopping  yes?  Reason I ask  is that every time I go into your Banbury store  (which is a few times a week)  there is always a customer unloading their trolley of goods and able to pay for their shopping without having scanned it themselves.  How is this able to happen? There are plenty of checkouts  including self service.   I know I m not alone in finding it very infuriating. üòê;;;;;2016-04-18T11:44:52+0000;1460979892;2016-04-18 13:44:52;0;8;0;0;8;8;3;5;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am starting a campaign to get fruit into our children when shopping with their mommies and daddies instead of the crisps they are given to keep them quiet.  One piece of fruit per child when shopping with their parents.  It won t cost that much and we teach our children early that fruit is the way to go and not a bag of crisps or biscuits .  Please write a response.  If we get enough people interested we can make this happen. Thank you.

One word..... And???  AND??? What sort of response is that? I was gob smacked... Had it been a man behind the counter I would have probably made more of a stink  (not being sexist  but my wife would have killed me had I screamed at this 55+ year old lady).. I was so taken aback by her lack of interest and empathy.. I have been I customer care for over 20 years and never ever have I had such a rude  unprofessional response to a complaint  ever... Without wanting to sound rude  that lady should be fired or at least put somewhere where she has no customer interaction.  Completely useless at her job... 1st rant over........

For a pound change(1coin)  I got.... 3*20p coins 2*10p coins 2*5p coins and 5 bloody 2p coins!! That is 12 coins instead of just the one.... Don t come back with  they aren t our machines  or  they must have had no pound coins in .. Your bloody responsibility..

I visited your store in Gosforth today with my fianc√©e and toddler daughter to purchase a few food items. I was asked for ID  to which I was confused and asked  what for?  to which the cashier said because of the Think 25 policy. I was even more confused by this as I hadn t purchased any tobacco products or alcohol. She said it was for the paracetamol I had added to the shopping as I knew we were running low at home. I didn t have any ID with me as a) I had forgotten my wallet and b) I m 31 and definitely don t look under 25 especially when out with my fianc√©e and daughter I clearly look like an adult! I was actually using my fianc√©es cash to pay given the forgetting of said wallet and so she offered to complete the transaction with her ID. The cashier  now joined by someone who seemed more senior refused to serve us the paracetamol even though there is no legal age restrictions on purchasing over the counter medication. Neither we nor other customers around could understand this absurdity. We ve been racking our brains since as to why we were refused but can t think of a reason that makes sense. Say for example I d had ID  and the paracetamol had been for a 15 year old sibling? It wouldn t matter as again it wouldn t be against the law unlike with alcohol or tobacco. The other scenario we thought of was if a young person bought some and didn t read the instructions properly  but then this was also irrelevant as my fianc√©e offered to buy them with her ID. Whilst the basic premise of this policy has some merits (you clearly wouldn t want a 5 year old buying it as the dosages would be too high etc)  we thought the enforcement of it by the staff was handled really badly. It was like a blanket policy had been issued that as soon as the till flagged that the item had a restriction on it  the staff were not allowed to use any judgement of their own. In summary we were very disappointed with this service. At least we saved 30p though eh?;;;;;2016-04-16T21:35:12+0000;1460842512;2016-04-16 23:35:12;4;22;4;0;26;22;5;17;27;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

You just had my last piece of custom.  Over the last few years your customer service has got worse  granted you have been innovative in pricing but we are the same old stupidity in embracing the modern era.  Just checked out with a small trolley load of goods and Iam told at the checkout I may not use my nectar card on an app ! No reason no explanation. It s your card and all it is  is a digital representation of a bar code ! It must be the physical card if I want to collect my nectar points ! All with a very grumpy cashier who seems to think that they were doing me a favour by serving me!   Now if had checked myself out the check out machine would not know the difference!!! After all it s a barcode linked to me !!!   So in this digital age when we are trying to save on the creation and usage of plastics Sainbury s wants us to keep using plastics in the form of cards! When they can just put them on our phones !!!! Like we do with almost every other business  Starbucks  British Airways.  I look forward to Amazon taking your business away over time !

Treat you as if you mater something the supermarkets have firmly forgotten !!

Today  in my local (Godlaming) store  instead of a 48g jar of fairtrade turmeric costing ¬£1  the only option is now the Schwarz jar of 31g costing ¬£1.35 and not fairtrade. So I m paying considerably more for less and not the quality I was used to. As I stood there in the aisle  I heard shopper after shopper say to their partners   no get the Sainsbury s one  only to realise after searching the shelves  that it wasn t there. In one stroke this has removed the consumer s ability to choose the better product  forcing us to get Schwarz or nothing. Are you planning to do the same thing with other lines? No more varieties of brands of coffee  just Kenco? No more varieties of cereal  just Kellogg? Removing choice like this  doesn t make me as the consumer buy a product that I feel is worse quality and less value for money - it sends me somewhere else to find the ability to choose the product I prefer. I realise Schwarz will have paid a hefty amount to be the only brand on the shelves in your stores  but I really hope that you put consumer choice first  reconsider and bring back the Sainsbury s own brand lines.;;;;;2016-04-16T19:20:32+0000;1460834432;2016-04-16 21:20:32;1;9;1;0;10;9;2;7;3;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

How utterly ridiculous is it that you provide a children s menu and highchairs but negate to provide tea spoons for children to eat with. When we asked for a teaspoon for our 19 month old daughter to eat with we were informed that because of health and safety reasons they cannot provide tea spoons to children to eat with. Please explain to me how it is a health and safety risk for a  child to be provided with a tea spoon so that he/she may eat? We didn t ask for a plastic spoon just a metal tea spoon and I find it absolutely ridiculous that we could not be provided with one. That coupled with the fact that my husband asked to change one item on his food order and swap it with a piece of toast and he was told there were no facilities to toast bread after 11am. What happens after 11am does the toaster go home? What was meant to be a quick pleasant trip into your sainsburys cafe turned into somewhat of a drama over two things which could have easily been rectified. I would appreciate it if someone could respond to this complaint. Many thanks;;;;;2016-04-16T16:05:04+0000;1460822704;2016-04-16 18:05:04;1;5;1;0;6;5;3;2;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

When you do manage to get their attention  they come over -  how many bags sir  scan them through. How nice! (Keeping in mind my shopping is normally bagged by now). So helpful :)  Only store that s does this too. Weird. Especially in an area like Burpham  Surrey.. I mean it s not Croydon (where bags are easily available).  I suspect the  manager  is stealing bags for themselves. Outrageous.  I bet their cupboards are packed with them  and their bins lined. Absolutely Outrageous.  To be fair  Aldi has opened pretty much across the road.. I may go see what their bag situation is like later.

Shopping at the Bamber Bridge store this weekend I handed my daughter half a dozen little bags as we walked down the fruit aisle. At the checkout the lady who served us spotted that my daughter still had one in her hand that we had not used. The lady asked my daughter (9) whether that was from this store & when my daughter said yes she asked for it back saying she could not leave the store with it or Sainsburys would receive a ¬£500 fine.  Please could you clarify as my daughter misunderstood and thought the lady was implying she was trying to  steal it  and that she would be the one getting a ¬£500 fine so she got a little panicky!

Arrived at 23.30 to find the shutters down.  It appears as though they ve cut back the opening hours.  The big sign outside does say 11pm  but the back light is broken on that bit which means it s not obvious when dark  which it invariably is at 11pm.  Why couldn t you have sent all nectar card holders who use the store an email alerting us to the change?  You recently emailed us about the end of brand match  so it s not as if you re averse to publicising  bad news .  I wasn t alone either  another lady had just arrived by taxi and was pretty upset too.  Thankfully Asda in Bexleyheath is still open 24hours  and their prices on the few things I wanted were much cheaper - ¬£2.02 off a shop which would have cost ¬£9.30 at Sainsbury s.  I might even still be in pocket after the extra petrol.

However  over the last 2 months the quality of Gala apples  red seedless grapes and blueberries has just been deteriorating in terms of it being more and more unripe.  Even after 1 week of sitting to ripen the products have still been unripe.  This came to a head last week when I had to throw a whole punnet of blueberries away as they were horribly sharp.    I have now decided to shop with other supermarket chains for my fruit. Suprisingly  they don t seem to have such an issue with quality leading me to think it is a supplier issue.   Is there any chance you could get your fruit buyer to look into this?   Many thanks    Maria;;;;;2016-04-11T15:13:51+0000;1460387631;2016-04-11 17:13:51;0;5;0;0;5;5;4;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My aim is to spread awareness about an issue that has been around for decades.   My girlfriend works at the checkout at Sainsbury s  and has experienced this problem since she started working there a few years ago. The problem I am referring to is customers (particularly men aged 30+) approaching her outside of her working hours.   Of course  part of a shop assistant s job is to be kind to customers and make sure that they are fully satisfied  and so to do this they must smile and make small talk so that customers feel happy and comfortable. However  this behaviour  probably 90% of the time  is mistaken for  flirtation  and consent for the customer to approach the employee if they see them outside of the workplace.   Now I m not talking about a customer passing by an employee in the street just saying  hello!  and moving on. What I m talking about is customers physically stopping employees in the street by grabbing their arm  and then proceeding to talk with the employee for more than 10 minutes  and continuing to talk even after the employee has told them they need to leave. In a lot of cases  some of which I have experienced myself in a retail job  customers even ask employees for their phone number.  This is harassment. It may not be sexual or physical  but it is still harassment  and it s an issue that seriously needs to be dealt with. Of course the employee in these kinds of situations has no choice but to be kind and considerate to the customer as their jobs can potentially be at risk if they seem rude in any way  and so the answer could not simply be for the employee to dismiss the customer straight away  or politely explain that they do not wish to talk to the customer outside of work. There is always a risk that the customer will react with aggression  or even complain about you to the company that you work for.   My girlfriend suffers from anxiety  but has overcome so much in the past few years. Now she has told me recently that she worries on her walk to work every day that she will bump into a customer and have to put up with this harassment again and again.   Something needs to be done. I don t know what  but this is a problem for customers in workplaces all around the globe. I hope I can at least raise more awareness with this message  and I hope that customers read this and think again about approaching employees outside of their workplace.;;;;;2016-04-11T12:59:49+0000;1460379589;2016-04-11 14:59:49;1;2;1;0;3;2;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I bought some pic n mix today  as I do most Sunday s (with it being cheat day and all that) but little did I know my life was about to change forever....  I started tucking into my sweets mid car journey because I have no self control and well  I love your pic n mix. BUT  today I put a sugar coated strawberry in my mouth and was absolutely flabbergasted....that s right! FLABBERGASTED. The last time I was flabbergasted was when Liverpool won the league. Neither happen often.  So Sainsburys  you see  it came to light that you have in fact changed pretty much all the pic n mix sweets. I also put a fried egg in my mouth just to confirm and it just wasn t the same. Now  I know Candy King is probably the supplier of sweets and they in fact made the decision to change them but  it s going to ruin your business if they continue to supply the pic n mix. In fact  I guarantee you ll be bust within a year pulling that kind of stunt.  I would therefore like to politely ask that you bring back the original sweets so Sunday doesn t just have to be the day before Monday.   I also want to let you know  I never shop in Asda or Tesco and I am very loyal.  I look forward to hearing from you.

My friend actually made a complaint about this no more than two weeks ago where Sainsbury reassured Kiki Nichol that the issue would be resolved and so the rant begins.....  My friend bought some baby food (Ella s kitchen) for her little boy who is just starting out on solids after noticing the texture was a bit unusual she checked the packaging to find the food went out of date in 2015! Sainbury s reassured my friend that this issue would be resolved and sent her a gift card.  Today my friend went back into the same Sainbury s (Brampton road  Bexley Heath) to find that they are still selling this brand that states 2015 on the date!   It isn t just a couple of days out of date!We are talking months out of date babies DO NOT have the same immune system s as us adults and this can and WILL make babies incredibly sick and in some cases can cause serious complications for young ones!   I for one am appalled that this has happened in the first place let alone been brought to the attention of sainsburys and yet nothing has actually been done on the matter they clearly don t care about the health and well being of there customers!   All I can say to all of you parents out there innocently buying these products is please check the use by dates before you purchase there baby food!

Today I would like to commend the Norwich Longwater store.   My son has saved Christmas and birthday money and sold some items and today was the day to buy the PS4 he had been saving for. After a disappointing trip to two different retailers in Norwich who only had the free game to go with the console and not the console we went to the Longwater store. Unfortunately they had the console but not the free game. Ashley from the phone department could see how disappointed my 12 year old was as we walked away.

My son left the store beaming with the console and game of his choice.  I want to thank Ashley and Josh for providing excellent customer service and going above and beyond to make my son happy.

I then asked about returning clothes  again the lady told me that the same applies. To be honest I am shocked. I have recently moved home and my nearest sainsburys is one that doesn t have a large homeware or clothing section. To know that I can t return these things there will stop me from buying such items when I am in your larger stores. I don t have the time to be travelling longer distances just to return something. Especially when I have the option of shopping at Tesco where I am able to return clothing to an express store! If this can t be changed then this information needs to be made available to customers before they buy your products. I m now left with one of your items that I don t want... And I have to wait until I go to a larger store (if I go to one before the returns policy runs out) or make a trip specially to return it.;;;;;2016-04-08T15:02:04+0000;1460127724;2016-04-08 17:02:04;0;6;0;0;6;6;2;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

This is linked to devastation of Indonesian forests and peat lands which we need and innocent animals such as orang-utans need for LIFE. You need to take responsibility for what you are creating by including these products in your stores. And make the change now to stop selling products with palm oil in them. BE SOCIALLY  ETHICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE. I contacted companies like your several years ago and was told that by 2015 you were all making sure palm oil was from sustainable sources but I do not see this in reality and it is 2016.

This has been ongoing now for months and even after talking to the mananger  eventually  of that store  your customer service team and writing to your HO. I m not sure that you realise that you are discriminating against him. He has a neurological disorder that causes memory problems therefore he is issued by his bank a  chip and signature  debit card. The chip on the card  communicates  to the till that is no PIN and a printed receipt is produced for the person using the card to Sign. The till operator should then check the signature and then enter an authorisation number  end of transaction  next customer please. Instead of being treated like any other paying customer he is told that  I have been told by my manager that we don t accept these cards  or  I just need to get my manager to authorise your card    this  sometimes causes embarrassment and is just wrong. I would like to know what Sainsbury s is going to do about this? Disability discrimination is not something that can swept under the carpet  ignored or bought off. The right thing to do would be make sure that all stores  nationwide  are informed that these cards exist and are excepted everywhere.;;;;;2016-04-08T09:43:46+0000;1460108626;2016-04-08 11:43:46;1;7;1;0;8;7;3;4;4;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I got one for beetroot  yes I do buy beetroot  but I get the large one which is cheaper per gram  the voucher is for the tiny jar (which in rugby you do not actually sell 240g version the smallest you have is 340g)  which working out that the 30 points is worth 15p and the difference between the 340g jar per g and the large jar per g  you actually save money by chucking the  voucher  on the fire and shopping as normal. This is surly a money grabbing con  disguised as a loyalty voucher?  Does not bother me as I can work these scams out  but you should be ashamed of yourself for ripping off people who are in a rush or actually remember a time when customers came first and relied on truth from companies......;;;;;2016-04-08T07:52:16+0000;1460101936;2016-04-08 09:52:16;3;4;3;0;7;4;2;2;0;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

I wonder how many  customers  you asked this time? Customers we asked would like lower prices than us checking to see if we are ripping you off by checking what our competitors are doing. I noticed when in your store yesterday that billingtons brown sugar is now 60p more than asda  the quiche has gone up 50p since Monday  the offers on bread has vanished  crisps have gone up and also every other supermarket own brand 1ltr flavoured water is 4 or 5 for ¬£1.50 yet yours are 45p each (and seem to always have a full shelf where as in the past with the 4 for ¬£1.50 it was nearly always sold out).

It is a terrible mistake to end Brand Match as customers may begin to look elsewhere to ensure they get the best prices.  I was never asked my opinion when shopping at our local Telford store.  I feel I will be worse off as a result of this change as you cannot guarantee that the  lower prices  will be on the products that I buy. Plus it is easy to put those prices back up again over time therefore discreetly and stealthily getting rid of Brand Match and the money spent on it. I feel this is a very bad move Sainsbury s. Not only the end of Brand Match but the reduction in Nectar points over the last year is a hard pill to swallow.

I was a bit on the peckish side and it filled a gap just nicely  to be fair  it wasn t a patch on my late gran s quiches but then none ever are as she had the baking hands of an angel  be that as it may  it was ok.  Then as I sat in the car waiting for my recently devoured quiche to find a slot to settle in before I drove home (I find if I have an impromptu snack and don t do this I end up with the burps  which can be quite a distraction whilst driving and trying to avoid the swarms of holiday makers who annually descend on Cornwall at this time of year) I nonchalantly read the ingredients list on the back of the package  to be fair I should have done this before making the purchase but alas what with remembering  vouchers and bags for life and nectar cards etc I forgot to pop my reading glasses in my pocket.  I noticed in the long list of published ingredients you list palm oil and I have to ask  given the exploitation of rain forests  the ethnic cleansing of indigenous populations  the destruction of habitats for all sorts of wildlife  fauna and flora just to enable the expansion of palm oil plantations  is it really and I mean really a necessary ingredient?   My late (god rest her soul) gran  whom I mentioned earlier  with the hands of an angel baker  never used palm oil in her quiche and it tasted delightful  her pastry was light as a feather  perfect of crumb and carried an indulgent buttery flavour  her filling was a joy to partake of.    So maybe just maybe you should omit the palm oil  which will benefit our fragile planet no end and may lead to your quiches getting somewhere close to my gran s perfect quiches.  In the interests of fairness I should mention that there are possibly many other gran s who also make pretty good quiches (not quite as good as my gran s quiches obviously but good nevertheless) and I bet they don t use palm oil either. So please Sainsbury s drop the palm oil I m sure it s  not that necessary.;;;;;2016-04-07T08:12:21+0000;1460016741;2016-04-07 10:12:21;1;5;1;1;7;5;1;4;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Left in limbo waiting for a price check by tills with trolley full of unpaid stock luckily I found a chair nearby to sit though. More or less 40 minutes passed and I was told to not to leave the area of tills and wait for  assistance. I used my initiative and found the original person dealing with it who gave me a surprise reaction that are you still here problem not sorted yet I said I thought you were sorting it but I was told the responsibility was passed onto member of Tu clothing who thus disappeared with the baby jeans so two unattended call outs were made followed by walk through most of store with customer service staff. No one could spot the missing items nor staff member there was theories that she either had gone home or was in a meeting upstairs apparently. Upon returning to tills area member staff spotted a pair of jeans that looked similar and was put on a totally different rail to where I picked them up from with the sale label ripped off but showing signs of being freshly removed with red patches colours.... Original price was honoured by supervisor but waiting was ridiculous and if I listened to staff at tills I would ve waited hours until anyone cared to remember about my problem.  Reason for problem was I doubled up nectar clothing voucher to exactly ¬£20 and I was told this will waste the remaining voucher threshold if I don t purchase the product at full price or at discounted price after a check with staff. Never had this problem before but it isn t the first instance of poor customer service by this Oldbury store staff. I was ready within minutes to look for an alternative item and to leave that product but staff insisted that I wait at till until problem sorted.  Really disappointed today with lack of communication received from the staff to  myself firstly and then the staff amongst themselves.;;;;;2016-04-05T20:51:11+0000;1459889471;2016-04-05 22:51:11;0;4;0;0;4;4;1;3;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

As I was leaving I saw a little girl wandering around by herself in the (empty and very large) entrance area  directly in front of the customer service desk. I stopped at the doors and watched her for a bit to see if she was with somebody  but there were no customers around. I asked her several times if she was with anyone  she eventually said no and kept walking around. This happened within one or two metres of a staff member sitting doing nothing at the CS desk  and so I asked her if she had seen the little girl with anyone. She screwed her face up and said ‚Äúno idea‚Äù before turning away. Luckily the girl‚Äôs grandmother then appeared.  Please forgive the public post  I hoped it might help to get your attention and take action on this. I‚Äôm sure I speak for every one of your customers when I say I would expect your staff members to be vigilant about this kind of thing  no matter what they are doing at the time but especially if they are at a customer service desk. The fact that this person didn‚Äôt notice is disappointing  but to then give such a curt response to me and not share any concern for this child is really shocking.;;;;;2016-04-05T14:04:14+0000;1459865054;2016-04-05 16:04:14;1;6;1;0;7;6;6;0;8;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I saw a nice jumper....so I went to the customer services desk and doubled up ¬£5 to ¬£10  by the time I got back to the Husband and the trolly he d seen something too. So I return to the customer services desk and explain that I had already doubled up but needed to double up another ¬£5 to ¬£10. That s fine says the assistant  she didn t mention that I couldn t use two vouchers. And it was fine - until I get to the checkout. They cannot take 2 x ¬£10 vouchers  they can only take 1 x ¬£20. So after the checkout captain trying  and telling me that once the vouchers have been exchanged they cannot be put back on my points value and the man behind me in the queue huffing and puffing...... we eventually go back to the customer services desk..... where I am told that of course they can go back on my points value and then we can have 1 x ¬£10 voucher (doubled up to ¬£20)  and she did (Well done  Debs) I eventually managed to buy the jumper and the other items using some of my points. And I was only in store for just under an hour and a half.   Sainsburys sort this out so that the staff and customers are able to understand how to treat these vouchers.

Yes  ¬£10 for a ¬£120 Hoover! So off we skip to the customer services really pleased with our discovery (it was the last one on the shelf) to get the points converted only to be met with  Ah  you havent shopped in this store before have you?   No we haven t  we are out for the day and popped in for some bits on our way home   was our reply.  I m sorry but we can t redeem your points in this store for 24hrs after your card has been swiped   What??  We reply in unison! Completely shocked that we can gain nectar points almost anywhere but when it comes to spending them we actually are quite restricted. How can a supermarket as big as Sainsburys have such restrictions on the redemption of the points that the customer has quite rightly earned!! Poor show Sainsburys!! Great way to look after loyalty!! We were so disappointed we left the store there and then without even returning our items back to the shelf!;;;;;2016-04-04T10:21:17+0000;1459765277;2016-04-04 12:21:17;0;5;0;0;5;5;2;3;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I see the camera I want on display  as usual no one was serving on the entertainment/click and collect counter. a customer was waiting  apparently he had time to stand and wait...I didn t with 4 children waiting to go home for their dinner. so off i went to the  customer service  dept. the man serving is always helpful  if not a tad surly  can you help me please  I want to double up my points and buy a camera  there is no one on the counter.  he called for someone. in the meantime I asked hijm  if the camera is not in stock can it be ordered if I pay in advance for the camera using my double up nectar points and cash?   you can only use your double up points if the camera arrives before the end of tuesday ..so even if I pay in advance if it doesn t arrive I cant use my double up vouchers?...no...fab customer service there sainsburys im prepared to buy a ¬£130 camera  pay in advance and you wont let me.....anyway the person he called from the entertainment dept took me back to the cameras and told me  its not in stock... can you sell me the display model?  ... no ...can you order one for me?...no?...I explained the double up vouchers situation...  well you could try ordering using click and collect ..can I pay when I collect then?...no...so I have to pay online?...yes....can I pay with double up vouchers online?...no...well  that wont work then will it...(I will point out I was very patient and polite  if not extremely frustrated  throughout.  ok  can you tell me if its in stock anywhere else please...yes..he checked...there is one in stock in Godalming...I have no idea where that is is there one anywhere else at all...no  that s the only one in our region...time to find out where Godalming is then...SUNDAY..into Godalming at 10.30..someone from the phone area quickly appeared at the click and collect counter...I explained what I was looking for and that id been told one is in stock..hmmm  I don t know where they are kept  I will find someone...off she went  whilst we waited. she returned shortly afterwards with another member of staff and they faffed about with cupboard keys...and we went to the cupboard...there was much searching of said  cupboard and a bo appeared  here it is and she was about to hand it to me...I pointed out it had  display box  written on the side..oh no  its not its in here..and she checked..yep no camera its on display...and you cant sell me the display model?...no......explained the previous store had checked record and they showed you had one in stock...oh  well that would be the display model...the one you cant sell me...yes...at this point I gave up.. annoyingly aware that a. I was not going to get my camera  b. you have no interest in the sale of a ¬£130 camera c. no one seems to know what the heck goes on in your entertainment/camera dept d. its strange that no one can sell a display model yet  when on the isle of wight last year  I bought a display model camera because that was all you had left  e. some training of your computer system is clearly required with staff f.

I am going to have to start going back to store and doing it myself. I m feeling a bit cross  that every time I order any kind of fresh meat or anything fresh in general  the use by dates are so soon after the delivery date  that unless you freeze absolutely everything on the day it s delivered  then its a struggle to use it all before it goes out of date and a lot goes in the bin. Wasting money. And for me  freezing everything isn t an option  as I fill my freezer with frozen goods at the same time! (Its only a small freezer!). So perhaps you should consider speaking to your  pickers  and asking them not to just pick the first thing off the shelves  but to look a bit further back and get a longer dated product!

I understand that to a degree  but I asked if she could use the handheld scanner and I would hold the phone  and was told absolutely not. When I asked if I could call out the card number for her to type in  she called a supervisor  who said that they were only allowed to accept actual in-the-flesh cards now and would not be able to type in the number from my card.  It seems a bit ridiculous when I can bank or apply for a passport using my phone that I can t receive a few supermarket loyalty points in a similar way. I d love to know why this is the case. I love collecting Nectar points  and not having to carry another piece of plastic is great. This seems a very backwards step and left me annoyed. I have also contacted Nectar about this issue.;;;;;2016-04-03T15:58:13+0000;1459699093;2016-04-03 17:58:13;0;12;0;0;12;12;2;10;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I thought it was a good deal. Got home and had a can straight away  it tasted odd  and honestly undrinkable. My partner tried to have one too and he thought it tasted disgusting and in his words like  watery gas . I even checked a 3rd can  just incase we had eaten something that didn t mix well with the watery gas drink. So we checked today and the cans went out of date in November 2015. Honestly don t know how that pack could ve stayed on the shelf so long.  I can t return them because I used the box to try and help an injured pigeon  it didn t even work  it flew off because of a fat kid on a scooter. We have 15 cans here that we can t use  and I don t think I d be believed taking these back to the store.  Genuinely concerned about shopping there again  I don t want to accidentally buy something else that was around before Christmas.;;;;;2016-04-03T14:16:01+0000;1459692961;2016-04-03 16:16:01;14;36;16;0;52;36;16;20;33;0;14;0;0;2;0;0;0

Last night  I noticed that your 500ml bottles of Sprite which  for at least a year have been priced at  Buy 2 for ¬£2   are now ¬£1.25 each with no discount if I buy 2.  Forgive my cynicism  but these two price changes have taken place suspiciously close to the so-called sugar tax proposed for the soft drinks companies which  we were told  would not come into force for 2 years and only then if the relevant companies did nothing to reduce sugar in them.   Could it be that Sainsbury s has taken advantage of this Budget Announcement to increase the prices  even though the  tax  should not be passed onto the consumer?;;;;;2016-04-03T12:10:23+0000;1459685423;2016-04-03 14:10:23;0;5;0;0;5;5;2;3;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Today  they have no 10 packs of Guinness and will not have any until Tuesday according to the assistant who checked it electronically for us. This meant we didn t have a big enough spend to claim our 5X Nectar points....Then we had to drive to the other end of town to Asda who had plenty of Guinness and loads of tills opened  resulting in no queue.

We sat down to a not very clean table  so I asked for it to be cleaned.  The assistant said she wouldn t be a moment.  By the time our food came the table still had not been cleaned!  Although ticking over quite well  the cafe was not rushed off its feet  and the assistant never returned to clean the table.  Why  oh why cannot cafeteria staff clean tables properly?  They seem not to know that the tables have an outside edge where all the drips seem to cling.  Why are the chairs not wiped and cleared of debris.  My chair had crumbs along the seat where it met the side of the chair  and heaven only knows what was stuck to it.  Yes  I could have moved  but looking around at the empty tables they all  looked dirty.  Some of the wooden chairs have seen better days and have been there since the store opened many years ago.    Isn t it time that these establishments concentrated on the cleanliness of the tables where people have to eat  and the chairs where they have to sit?  After all   we are paying for a service  as well as the food!  As you walk past this cafeteria it looks OK  but get closer and it really leaves a lot to be desired.  As I do a weekly shop in this store  I shall keep my eyes peeled for any improvement.  Needless to say  I shall not be using this facility again!;;;;;2016-04-01T08:38:24+0000;1459499904;2016-04-01 10:38:24;0;4;0;0;4;4;1;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0
