After being allocated a slot at 2pm to get my shopping delivery  the driver turning up an hour before without previous warning  I find out that a whole crate of my shopping is missing!! I reluctantly agreed to get the rest of my shopping redelivered tomorrow as advised by the driver. Not having had a confirmation email  text or phone call confirming the new delivery slot for Sunday  I decided to ring costumer service to get it from them. You can imagine how surprised I was when I learnt that Sainsbury s had no intention of redeliver and they were going to process a refund. They just forgot to inform the costumer of this very important information! You can imagine that I am a lot less than impressed with the communication and the overall costumer service. After being a loyal costumer for many years I will definitely have to rethink were to shop from now!

I ve tried to remove it  although it doesn t much matter now as that card has been shut off by the fraud department of my bank.  Tonight I started getting the notifications again like before that someone has tried to update the address details on my account  twice this evening between 19:00 and 20:00. I ve had to reset the password on the account but it wont let me shut my Sainsbury s account.  Since you can t seem to keep your customers details safe I have no desire to any shopping with you anymore and to be fair I haven t done an online shop with you since July 2015. Your customer service department isn t open in the late evenings it would seem when this is occurring as I ve tried to call. Can you let me know where I can make a complaint and have my account closed.;2016-04-29T23:55:21+0000;10154793359764377_10154794272564377;pageowner;0;I am very sorry about this Jennifer.

Please can you tell me out of the 춲4 voucher less the 춲3.65 cost of the binned items  exactly what sort of thing I could treat a loved one to for 35p???;2016-04-29T09:12:01+0000;10154791614349377_10154792101954377;765d2533b352e0fb1e3b5e33e320a80bebdd7eca;0;http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/sweets/barratt-sherbet-fountain;2016-04-29T13:58:12+0000;0

This is the email you guys sent me. If this is the case i dont want the products. I rather spend my money else where. I just wanted to try the products to see if my family and i like them.  Dear Skye   Thanks for taking the time to contact us.   It s disappointing that the voucher for the promotional free items as advised on our website didn t redeem at the correct price on your order. I can appreciate that these evouchers offer a chance to try new products that you may not have tried before  so I can understand your concern that on this occasion the correct offer hasn t been taken of your order. I m sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.   I can confirm  for each promotional offer  under the terms and conditions  it states that there is a limited amount of products that can be given for free. They need to be redeemed within a time limit or until all samples have been redeemed. Additionally  it states  that it isn뗪 valid in conjunction with any offer  subject to availability while stocks last and one free sample per account.    As you뗬e a number of free promotional items on your order this is causing a technical error and the vouchers won뗪 redeem at the correct amount.   You can find the terms of each promotion by clicking on the  +  icon just under the redemption instructions.   If you require further assistance  please reply to this email or contact us on 0800 328 1700 selecting option 1  then option 1 again and we ll be happy to help.     We appreciate the time you뗬e taken to contact us and we look forward to seeing you online shortly.   Kind regards ;2016-04-28T12:24:46+0000;10154789298604377_10154789431669377;pageowner;0;Hi there. As the emailed explains, there are terms and conditions to these free product vouchers which is why you were charged for them. I'd be happy to send you a evoucher for the price of these items. Could you send over your order number please?Thanks, Megan.;2016-04-28T13:23:52+0000;0

My four year old boy is on a diabetic diet  not because he has diabetes but his bladder is allergic to sugar.   The problem I am finding is... It s a huge shock to suddenly have no sugar in a diet but how awful it is trying to find products he can have... Today after spending hours in our sainsburys store with my 4 year old and 1 year old getting very grumpy I came across a fantastic hot chocolate suitable for diabetics.... Along with sugar free lollies... But why can they not be more obvious... Along with a diabetics jam. The other thing I notice is these products are low to the floor... Again not a huge issue for me but hardly makes finding new products easier but people with diabetes may have mobility issues or struggle bending etc. I appreciate these may not be the best sellers in store but with diabetes on the rise could you not do more to support people?

This means that products may be suitable for some diabetics but unsuitable for others.  The safest option is to look at the sugar content on the labels to check whether particular products are suitable for you. I've logged your feedback internally. Faiza.;2016-04-28T13:09:36+0000;0

My four year old boy is on a diabetic diet  not because he has diabetes but his bladder is allergic to sugar.   The problem I am finding is... It s a huge shock to suddenly have no sugar in a diet but how awful it is trying to find products he can have... Today after spending hours in our sainsburys store with my 4 year old and 1 year old getting very grumpy I came across a fantastic hot chocolate suitable for diabetics.... Along with sugar free lollies... But why can they not be more obvious... Along with a diabetics jam. The other thing I notice is these products are low to the floor... Again not a huge issue for me but hardly makes finding new products easier but people with diabetes may have mobility issues or struggle bending etc. I appreciate these may not be the best sellers in store but with diabetes on the rise could you not do more to support people?

Just a point we use the wrapping for the bits we trim off - I'm sure I'm not alone that this goes straight in the bin! So to clarify is a receipt enough?  How do we prove the flowers died!  My query is after 4 yrs of amazing flowers what has changed over the last 3 weeks?  Surely this should be referred to the buying team? And I won't waste my money this week as from what I can see it's going to be impossible for me to ever be able to prove the death of the flowers to be able to get a refund.

If I'd been flustered and not really noticing, I'd have seen 2kg and worked it out on that, I'd only have cooked it for 12 mins less to my own reckoning and it would have had its juices checked and given a bit more time at the end. ( course my roast potatoes and veg would be waiting then). It's quite obvious everyone cooks slightly differently, and that most people ignore the cook time on labels, so I think the weight being accurate is probably more important. I just realised with a big bowl and water I could still work out how much it weighed. Good old Archimedes.;2016-04-27T06:23:27+0000;1

I've worked in supermarket customer service before and this definitely isn't a sackable offence; if anything it's an area of commendment to treat a loyal customer that you've become aquainted with and friendly towards with a few extra perishable items that weren't selling. The relationship between an employee and a customer is so vital and when you become chatty and enjoy their company it shows that you're more than just someone to make money from. He makes every customer smile and sainsbury's have a truly remarkable employee which they should feel proud about too. And thank you, i really did enjoy my 18 wings!";2016-04-27T08:26:55+0000;2

A bit of a let down in my opinion.;2016-04-23T12:59:29+0000;10154776791764377_10154791701029377;pageowner;0;Thank you for taking the time to contact us. It뗩 really useful to know about your concerns and we are sorry that you were disappointed by our level of promotion for St George뗩 Day.  All of our stores in England promoted St George뗩 Day by displaying the St George flag next to the many English products we sell. Amanda.;2016-04-29T10:03:38+0000;0

I didn t have a problem with this initially and followed the instruction to move my account over.  I then purchased my next read Order reference 1881233 and I can not get it to download to my Nook. I have followed the instructions but it seems that the Adobe reader program does not recognise my nook device.  I am getting seriously annoyed with this and I would like to hear about how you are going to fix this for me.;2016-04-23T12:15:13+0000;10154776717484377_10154776946349377;pageowner;0;Apologies Alexandra.

After waiting patiently for a self checkout to become free  one of your staff essentially pushed in front of me and proceeded to take it out of service - presumably to cash up.   I appreciate that this needs to be done  and that later in the day is less likely to cause disruption.   However  barging in front of me while I m walking towards it with a heavy basket is simply rude. I m sure that waiting a couple of minutes would have seen the checkout unused by customers.

I burst in to tears and said I was exhausted and could someone perhaps help me get my shopping to the till  and Samantha was amazing. So kind. She made me feel like it was the most normal thing in the world  sat me down  got me water  and had two members of staff deal with my shopping. She then escorted me to my car  and had her husband  who had been patiently waiting for her outside  load my shopping in to the car. Samantha  I don t know how that scene would have played out if you hadn t come to my rescue. It s people like you who make the world go round.

(I d used the self checkout machine didn t give reciept) luckily I paid by card and used my nectar card. The rude assistant called a supervisor and spoke to her privately. She came out and gave me attitude and tufted at me when I explained again that the machine didn t give me a reciept. At the this point the rude assistant had taken my paid for sandwich off me. As I was walking over to the till I said to the supervisor I was upset that the assistant had accused me of taking a bite out of the sandwich without paying for it. She said we ll you should pay for it first then asked me for the receipt.  At this point I not only felt hugely embarrassed but angry to and asked her if she had listened to a word I said. She then started going on about my attitude. This is a total disgrace and I will never use this store again. I spoke with the customer services who took my number am still waiting to hear back.

Sorry I never got their names but this happened at 9.48 yesterday morning. I was wearing a shirt trousers and had my work badge on. So not only was I humiliated but the name of the company I work for was also on show. Why on earth would I go back into your store and try to exchange a ""Stolen"" sandwich when wearing  My company name clearly visible on my attire. I'm sorry but this is completely unacceptable and your staff need to be held accountable for their accusations this was a defamation of my character and I was clearly accused of stealing in front of other customers. I would like copies of the video footage. I will be getting a statement from my bank to prove that I paid for these goods before I was refunded.

Another assistant came up and said   You can t just take a bite out of our food and put it back because you don t like it!!  I explained I d paid for it and that it was cold but she didn t believe me I said I was going to the till to get a refund.  (I d used the self checkout machine didn t give reciept) luckily I paid by card and used my nectar card. The rude assistant called a supervisor and spoke to her privately. She came out and gave me attitude and tufted at me when I explained again that the machine didn t give me a reciept. At the this point the rude assistant had taken my paid for sandwich off me. As I was walking over to the till I said to the supervisor I was upset that the assistant had accused me of taking a bite out of the sandwich without paying for it. She said we ll you should pay for it first then asked me for the receipt.  At this point I not only felt hugely embarrassed but angry to and asked her if she had listened to a word I said. She then started going on about my attitude. This is a total disgrace and I will never use this store again. I spoke with the customer services who took my number am still waiting to hear back.  I hope now one else ever gets accused of something like this in front of other people it s the most humiliating thing ever I even had another customer shout out about me being moody and unhappy cause I couldn t get hot food!!!!!;2016-04-22T06:16:16+0000;10154773820649377_10154774340484377;5db0677e8c53bdcce0690f91511a616866047b57;1;Ok Stuart I can see I am going to have to take this further. I appreciate you trying to help. Asking me to go to the store and contact them is a little out of order. I will be seeking legal advice about this situation now as I can see Sainsbury's feel that my public humiliation and being accused of stealing is worth 춲20. Also it seems OK for your staff to accuse innocent people of thieving in public but do not have to apologise in person. Wow maybe I should come and work for Sainsbury's knowing I can insult customers and be fully supported by my employer. I know this is not personally your fault Stuart and I am not blaming you but please inform you managers I will be taking this further. If the store Manager of SLOANE AVENUE would like to contact me then I suggest makes an effort. It is not for me to contact him. Working in customer services for a much more conscientious company we contact our clients personally if something has gone wrong, we also do not accuse them of stealing in front of other clients. Thank you;2016-04-22T12:14:56+0000;0

Firstly I'm not looking for money from Sainsbury's I'm looking for an apology from the two people that accused me of stealing in front of other people and which caused me to be verbally abused and threatened to be laid out by a man I've never met beacuase I was holding up a queue. Samantha Denim we all know your Dad's a pedophile right I heard a girl say it the other day.  Oh Lesley Ledger didn't your boyfriend get done for rape I heard your neighbours saying in the supermarket. How did that feel not nice huh when something untrue is said about you in front of other people. So Ben Harris if a cash sum would make you feel better after being insulted then good for you I'm just asking for a simple apology for being wrongly accused. I hope none of you or your children get wrongly accused of stealing. And if they do don't be a baby about it and when your work colleagues and people that work near you find out I'm sure 춲20 will make you feel better. I normally just shrug these things off but what if it had been your mum that was accused would you feel the same then?? I know I would go mad about it . So why is it so wrong for me to be mad for myself?;2016-04-22T22:04:03+0000;0

Another assistant came up and said   You can t just take a bite out of our food and put it back because you don t like it!!  I explained I d paid for it and that it was cold but she didn t believe me I said I was going to the till to get a refund.  (I d used the self checkout machine didn t give reciept) luckily I paid by card and used my nectar card. The rude assistant called a supervisor and spoke to her privately. She came out and gave me attitude and tufted at me when I explained again that the machine didn t give me a reciept. At the this point the rude assistant had taken my paid for sandwich off me. As I was walking over to the till I said to the supervisor I was upset that the assistant had accused me of taking a bite out of the sandwich without paying for it. She said we ll you should pay for it first then asked me for the receipt.  At this point I not only felt hugely embarrassed but angry to and asked her if she had listened to a word I said. She then started going on about my attitude. This is a total disgrace and I will never use this store again. I spoke with the customer services who took my number am still waiting to hear back.  I hope now one else ever gets accused of something like this in front of other people it s the most humiliating thing ever I even had another customer shout out about me being moody and unhappy cause I couldn t get hot food!!!!!;2016-04-22T06:16:16+0000;10154773820649377_10154775999219377;848a0d1d348b6e1616e4cf2f69f0d51df81b173e;1;Dear Martin Smith.....I hope your bum feels better soon.

This clearly is what happens when a company gets way too big for its own boots. Perhaps even running CRB checks if need be given the typically disgusting attitude their employees have. I recommend you screenshot the comment that have been made towards to you, which I know you've probably done, and society can again look after another zero hours contract worker.

It's nothing to a big company but I want to spend my money in a place  that respects it customers. The girl could have asked a few very simple questions to find out if I'd paid for it or not. How did you pay for that today? Which till did you use? A thief would have said forget it an honest person like myself would have given the right info.  Thanks again for commenting means a lot when I'm getting hassled from a small group of people. 游땕;2016-04-24T05:35:03+0000;1

Opened the sandwich outside store was cold again  (a health and safety issues in its self) went back in the same guy was there started speaking with him. Another assistant came up and said   You can t just take a bite out of our food and put it back because you don t like it!!  I explained I d paid for it and that it was cold but she didn t believe me I said I was going to the till to get a refund.  (I d used the self checkout machine didn t give reciept) luckily I paid by card and used my nectar card. The rude assistant called a supervisor and spoke to her privately. She came out and gave me attitude and tufted at me when I explained again that the machine didn t give me a reciept. At the this point the rude assistant had taken my paid for sandwich off me. As I was walking over to the till I said to the supervisor I was upset that the assistant had accused me of taking a bite out of the sandwich without paying for it. She said we ll you should pay for it first then asked me for the receipt.  At this point I not only felt hugely embarrassed but angry to and asked her if she had listened to a word I said. She then started going on about my attitude. This is a total disgrace and I will never use this store again. I spoke with the customer services who took my number am still waiting to hear back.  I hope now one else ever gets accused of something like this in front of other people it s the most humiliating thing ever I even had another customer shout out about me being moody and unhappy cause I couldn t get hot food!!!!!;2016-04-22T06:16:16+0000;10154773820649377_10154774025419377;404e83921d2863b67022d07cb338119f6aba50dd;0;Terrible customer service Martin Smith .

I would ring customer services up and explain that you are mortified you could be treated in such a way as to cause you embarassment and distress by rude staff at that branch. sometimes people don't seem to see it is the principal of the situation, that makes you feel you need to stand up for yourself and it is not whether it is petty to them but how it makes you feel. xxx;2016-04-23T07:07:46+0000;1

As I was walking over to the till I said to the supervisor I was upset that the assistant had accused me of taking a bite out of the sandwich without paying for it. She said we ll you should pay for it first then asked me for the receipt.  At this point I not only felt hugely embarrassed but angry to and asked her if she had listened to a word I said. She then started going on about my attitude. This is a total disgrace and I will never use this store again. I spoke with the customer services who took my number am still waiting to hear back.  I hope now one else ever gets accused of something like this in front of other people it s the most humiliating thing ever I even had another customer shout out about me being moody and unhappy cause I couldn t get hot food!!!!!;2016-04-22T06:16:16+0000;10154773820649377_10154779025404377;b680e20c14fde4a3c4c3c6216afec26dbb350a74;0;Hi Martin, just wanted to say how appalled i was to read what some rude and badly trained Sainsbury staff put you through. I would have been mortified at that behavior and although I have read you only want an apology from the staff concerned, I think Sainsburys need to be looking at the bigger picture and the appology you want should be forthcoming immediately on a personal level, but Sainsburys also need to be apologising big time as well, given the other comments made it would appear there is a huge hole in their customer service training and i am sure there shareholders will not be impressed at how much trade this incompetence will lose them!! Rant over, keep that beautiful chin up and keep showing that cheeky grin xx;2016-04-24T09:52:23+0000;1

I gather this is another trial of the sainsbury s scan & go app which never got off the ground. This does sound like a good idea which I believe should hopefully in the near future be launched. I m aware that W******e  is in the process of rolling out a similar app which will run alongside it s in store self scan hand held units. I am also aware that T***o now also have it s own version of scan as you go now available at more of it s larger stores.

Rob, you can very easily prove it's not a faulty gauge on Elvis as the onboard computer uses a different measurement system, so if that doesn't tally with miles left vs needle gauge, you know it's a fault in the car, but if it does, it's a fault with the pump. My tt had this fault so I know how to check it as advised by audi. Why are people on this thread happy to say your gauge is wrong but the pump's gauge is infalable? ridiculous logic! The petrol pump gauges are calibrated on a regular basis for the very reason that they get an enormous amount of use and DO need adjustment from time to time, so it's perfectly reasonable to assume the pump is wrong.;2016-04-20T20:10:28+0000;0

When we were going through the shop to put away we noticed that the cucumber was all soft  the lettuce had all residue and water in bottom of bag. The tomatoes were short dated along with mushrooms and strawberries. The bananas were already turning brown. The mince we ordered was short dated and packaging was starting to blow out already. Generally a disgusting shop that nearly cost around 춲75 or more.  When we noticed this we emailed you. Sunday I had to throw all the fresh above out.

Prices differ throughout the UK and you will see varying prices even between outlets owned by the same company. We want to ensure our petrol stations remain competitive within their local area, offering customers a fair price wherever they live.  We therefore adjust the price at each station using locally gathered pricing information. We also run regular promotions on fuel including bonus Nectar points and money off per litre when spending a qualifying amount in our stores. Ryan.;2016-04-18T14:31:38+0000;0

That said, just last week they were moved into the lunch food section, which at the time I thought made great sense, seeing as they were included in the meal deal offers.  No sooner have they been moved into the lunch food section, they are taken out of the meal deal offer!  Shady to say the least as the cost of purchasing the salads has now almost doubled!!

It wasn't particularly busy. I never tend to shop at busier times. It was so quiet in fact that only one of the two fast track lanes was open.  The biggest queue was actually the fast track one, as myself and the 4 customers behind me had to wait for the shopper who didn't have a scanner.

Managers get to choose what is stocked in their stores. They choose from a central stock list. There was an article in the Sunday paper magazine with this mug being stocked in Sainsburys. Being told that it is not stocked on any local stores is a choice made by local managers and I feel that it is a bit odd that with that article being published that the store managers chose not to stock them. Very disappointing. I am not a Sainsbury customer. My closest one is 8 miles away so I rarely shop there. I chose to go there this weekend so that I could get one of those mugs. Think what you like - this is not lies or anything shady. It's a genuine enquiry about why a selection of stores are not stocking something that has been advertised nationally .

Maybe the ill-named ""Careline"" (who quite obviously don't care a monkey's!) should all get together and figure out which 'hymn sheet' they are all singing from! The shop says she would have to wait 24 hours before any of the credit could be used, the email to me from the website says there should be NO delay in being able to use the credit but describes it as an 'inconvenience' that grand daughter was treated badly and made to feel a fool very publicly in the shop, and the FB advisor says that there is a 1-hour block on a card topped up by more than 춲80. What a stupid mess!! Well done, Sainsburys! A great way to gain market share back  NOT!!!;2016-04-18T15:43:54+0000;0

So next day I go to your customer service desk to point out this oversight... Do you know what your excellent customer care staff said?  One word..... And???  AND??? What sort of response is that? I was gob smacked... Had it been a man behind the counter I would have probably made more of a stink  (not being sexist  but my wife would have killed me had I screamed at this 55+ year old lady).. I was so taken aback by her lack of interest and empathy.. I have been I customer care for over 20 years and never ever have I had such a rude  unprofessional response to a complaint  ever... Without wanting to sound rude  that lady should be fired or at least put somewhere where she has no customer interaction.  Completely useless at her job... 1st rant over........ Now  to those self service tills.... Why when it is giving out change  is it always in low denominator coins? For a pound change(1coin)  I got.... 3*20p coins 2*10p coins 2*5p coins and 5 bloody 2p coins!! That is 12 coins instead of just the one.... Don t come back with  they aren t our machines  or  they must have had no pound coins in .. Your bloody responsibility..

I wasn't bothered about it being closed either, bothered about the stupid staffs response, I expect shops to shut on these days..

So next day I go to your customer service desk to point out this oversight... Do you know what your excellent customer care staff said?  One word..... And???  AND??? What sort of response is that? I was gob smacked... Had it been a man behind the counter I would have probably made more of a stink  (not being sexist  but my wife would have killed me had I screamed at this 55+ year old lady).. I was so taken aback by her lack of interest and empathy.. I have been I customer care for over 20 years and never ever have I had such a rude  unprofessional response to a complaint  ever... Without wanting to sound rude  that lady should be fired or at least put somewhere where she has no customer interaction.  Completely useless at her job... 1st rant over........ Now  to those self service tills.... Why when it is giving out change  is it always in low denominator coins? For a pound change(1coin)  I got.... 3*20p coins 2*10p coins 2*5p coins and 5 bloody 2p coins!! That is 12 coins instead of just the one.... Don t come back with  they aren t our machines  or  they must have had no pound coins in .. Your bloody responsibility.. Like a lot of people  I throw small change into a money bank but because of these machines I have to carry all my change because if I put all the small coins I get from your bloody machines  I would be skint before Monday mornings..;2016-04-17T10:33:34+0000;10154760870434377_10154761028814377;pageowner;1;Very sorry about the poor service Matt.

I was asked for ID  to which I was confused and asked  what for?  to which the cashier said because of the Think 25 policy. I was even more confused by this as I hadn t purchased any tobacco products or alcohol. She said it was for the paracetamol I had added to the shopping as I knew we were running low at home. I didn t have any ID with me as a) I had forgotten my wallet and b) I m 31 and definitely don t look under 25 especially when out with my fianc칠e and daughter I clearly look like an adult! I was actually using my fianc칠es cash to pay given the forgetting of said wallet and so she offered to complete the transaction with her ID. The cashier  now joined by someone who seemed more senior refused to serve us the paracetamol even though there is no legal age restrictions on purchasing over the counter medication. Neither we nor other customers around could understand this absurdity. We ve been racking our brains since as to why we were refused but can t think of a reason that makes sense. Say for example I d had ID  and the paracetamol had been for a 15 year old sibling? It wouldn t matter as again it wouldn t be against the law unlike with alcohol or tobacco. The other scenario we thought of was if a young person bought some and didn t read the instructions properly  but then this was also irrelevant as my fianc칠e offered to buy them with her ID. Whilst the basic premise of this policy has some merits (you clearly wouldn t want a 5 year old buying it as the dosages would be too high etc)  we thought the enforcement of it by the staff was handled really badly. It was like a blanket policy had been issued that as soon as the till flagged that the item had a restriction on it  the staff were not allowed to use any judgement of their own. In summary we were very disappointed with this service. At least we saved 30p though eh?;2016-04-16T21:35:12+0000;10154759580034377_10154759610289377;fda127e760d26a213a6c7549d966985eddc967b1;1;Yeah but staff should be able to use judgement rather than just blanket refuse.

I was even more confused by this as I hadn t purchased any tobacco products or alcohol. She said it was for the paracetamol I had added to the shopping as I knew we were running low at home. I didn t have any ID with me as a) I had forgotten my wallet and b) I m 31 and definitely don t look under 25 especially when out with my fianc칠e and daughter I clearly look like an adult! I was actually using my fianc칠es cash to pay given the forgetting of said wallet and so she offered to complete the transaction with her ID. The cashier  now joined by someone who seemed more senior refused to serve us the paracetamol even though there is no legal age restrictions on purchasing over the counter medication. Neither we nor other customers around could understand this absurdity. We ve been racking our brains since as to why we were refused but can t think of a reason that makes sense. Say for example I d had ID  and the paracetamol had been for a 15 year old sibling? It wouldn t matter as again it wouldn t be against the law unlike with alcohol or tobacco. The other scenario we thought of was if a young person bought some and didn t read the instructions properly  but then this was also irrelevant as my fianc칠e offered to buy them with her ID. Whilst the basic premise of this policy has some merits (you clearly wouldn t want a 5 year old buying it as the dosages would be too high etc)  we thought the enforcement of it by the staff was handled really badly. It was like a blanket policy had been issued that as soon as the till flagged that the item had a restriction on it  the staff were not allowed to use any judgement of their own. In summary we were very disappointed with this service. At least we saved 30p though eh?;2016-04-16T21:35:12+0000;10154759580034377_10154759792664377;89aca2746be8e6b24dfd3a22772353b2fd199a50;0;I dont get it your over 25 and your moaning because someone said you looked younger.

When they can just put them on our phones !!!! Like we do with almost every other business  Starbucks  British Airways.  I look forward to Amazon taking your business away over time !

How utterly ridiculous is it that you provide a children s menu and highchairs but negate to provide tea spoons for children to eat with. When we asked for a teaspoon for our 19 month old daughter to eat with we were informed that because of health and safety reasons they cannot provide tea spoons to children to eat with. Please explain to me how it is a health and safety risk for a  child to be provided with a tea spoon so that he/she may eat? We didn t ask for a plastic spoon just a metal tea spoon and I find it absolutely ridiculous that we could not be provided with one. That coupled with the fact that my husband asked to change one item on his food order and swap it with a piece of toast and he was told there were no facilities to toast bread after 11am.

Sainsbury's won't exchange without the receipt.    LESSONS LEARNED: 1.Don't buy/except gifts of jeans from Sainsbury's they're not long enough.  2. Attempt to be like Mary Poppins and be practically perfect in every way. (I bet she never loses her receipts, and she gets her cleaning done for her)  3. Never try to be sarcastic on Facebook, people just don't get it.  4. Not to post anything on Facebook explaining my disappointment about customer service again. As complete strangers feel it's ok to accuse you of stealing, fraud etc etc   I worked in retail for quite a few years I know the deal with returns and exchanges, I was just surprised an exchange option wasn't given.   Oh well I'm over it now. Life goes on.游땜;2016-04-17T06:10:08+0000;1

You probably don't realise that what you did was going to mean so much to me but once I got home I got thinking and what I could have potentially never got back was some of the best memories of my life. The phone which you so kindly returned contain all the photos of my pregnancy including videos of my kicking pregnant belly, all my sons photos from the day he was born till now. Pictures of my daughters first day of school, birthdays, Christmas. All this I could have lost mean so much more to me than the money and bank cards and the phone itself. These would have been memories lost that I could never share with my children and hopefully one day their children. I'm so grateful to you, you wonderful, kind, honest lady.

Sales are also restricted to customers aged 16 and over.  In line with most other supermarkets, we've taken these steps as a responsible retailer to ensure these products are purchased and used appropriately. A wider range of analgesics in larger pack sizes are available stores that contain a pharmacy, sold under the supervision of a pharmacist. Danny.;2016-04-13T07:15:17+0000;0

Given the post above (ref the NHS) which clearly states there is no risk of taking the combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol together (even at full recommended dose), may I ask why you have this restriction in place?

I might add, I have been able to purchase 2 of each in the recent past from your stores, during the same transaction - the till didn't reject the transaction as one might expect.";2016-04-13T08:23:28+0000;0

You can check the box for the recommended dosage. My point is, that the two drugs are not contraindicative - as I said above, it's safe to use them (at recommended dose) at the same time. If you look above you will see where I have added a screen shot of the NHS guideline on this.  For the record, taking two packets of paracetamol is very dangerous. The ibuprofen, whilst not recommended, wouldn't result in serious toxicity like the paracetamol (whether taken individually or combined);2016-04-13T08:35:08+0000;0

I have purchased 2 X both many times in store with no problem at all (admittedly not at this branch) The risk of OD with paracetamol is seriously high, however this is not the case with ibuprofen. At first the member of staff this evening told me ibuprofen contained paracetamol which is why I couldn't have all of them. I showed her the ingredients to assure her that isn't the case and she seemed genuinely confused. The manager insisted its company policy and that was that. Which, if that's the case, is fine; makes me wonder why I've been able to buy 2 of both in other stores though. Hopefully Sainsburys will get back to us with their policy and clear this up.  I'm all for safeguarding, and having sensible precautions in place, but with these two particular drugs I cannot understand what the issue is.

I agree entirely that retailers ought to be responsible.  My initial post was to ask simply what the policy is. That has been answered now. My next question is just asking why this particular combination (paracetamol and ibuprofen) is in place. I agree that Paracetamol, and Asprin indeed, need to have tight restrictions on their sales, both individually and combined. It's the ibuprofen that doesn't make sense (medically).

It's seems there is a lot of confusion about what is and what isn't allowed and why.  Colette, to answer your question - no, mixing paracetamol and ibuprofen doesn't cause overdose (see my NHS screenshot above or have a look at their website)  Ian, Sainsbury's policy is that you can buy two packs of 16 tablets in one transaction, without a pharmacist present.  Usually, when my husband returns to Afghanistan (work) I buy two packs of paracetamol and two packs of ibuprofen to see him through his rotation, from Sainsburys. I used a different branch yesterday, and was refused. As a customer it was rather irritating, as I've had no problem before, and these two drugs can be safely used together; hence my queries.";2016-04-13T10:24:57+0000;0

My aim is to spread awareness about an issue that has been around for decades.   My girlfriend works at the checkout at Sainsbury s  and has experienced this problem since she started working there a few years ago. The problem I am referring to is customers (particularly men aged 30+) approaching her outside of her working hours.   Of course  part of a shop assistant s job is to be kind to customers and make sure that they are fully satisfied  and so to do this they must smile and make small talk so that customers feel happy and comfortable. However  this behaviour  probably 90% of the time  is mistaken for  flirtation  and consent for the customer to approach the employee if they see them outside of the workplace.   Now I m not talking about a customer passing by an employee in the street just saying  hello!  and moving on. What I m talking about is customers physically stopping employees in the street by grabbing their arm  and then proceeding to talk with the employee for more than 10 minutes  and continuing to talk even after the employee has told them they need to leave. In a lot of cases  some of which I have experienced myself in a retail job  customers even ask employees for their phone number.  This is harassment. It may not be sexual or physical  but it is still harassment  and it s an issue that seriously needs to be dealt with. Of course the employee in these kinds of situations has no choice but to be kind and considerate to the customer as their jobs can potentially be at risk if they seem rude in any way  and so the answer could not simply be for the employee to dismiss the customer straight away  or politely explain that they do not wish to talk to the customer outside of work. There is always a risk that the customer will react with aggression  or even complain about you to the company that you work for.   My girlfriend suffers from anxiety  but has overcome so much in the past few years. Now she has told me recently that she worries on her walk to work every day that she will bump into a customer and have to put up with this harassment again and again.   Something needs to be done. I don t know what  but this is a problem for customers in workplaces all around the globe. I hope I can at least raise more awareness with this message  and I hope that customers read this and think again about approaching employees outside of their workplace.;2016-04-11T12:59:49+0000;10154744478224377_10154744633149377;223cd4cdd856a20d2cc1312cd063b7d195b72393;1;Thank you for taking the time to read my message!;2016-04-11T14:08:51+0000;0

Essentially, we changed two of the recipes within the 12 pack going from: Rabbit and Chicken pouch to Chicken Pouch Chicken and Turkey pouch to Turkey Pouch. There were no changes made to the Beef and Lamb pouches. The only other change was the move to a silver pouch however this did not require changes to the product recipes. Hope this helps, Danny.;2016-04-12T12:29:10+0000;0

That explains way he still likes the beef (and not to bad with lamb)! but does not the ones that have changed. I wonder if other customers have found a difference, I suppose you would only know in your sales. Be great for our feline if you sold boxes of 12 with just beef and lamb!!;2016-04-12T13:46:25+0000;0

Today a delivery man from Sainsburys  Stratford in London  his name is CONWAY  refused to deliver my order to the first floor as he believed this was his right. This is the second time he has done this. In the past he was reprimanded and I was forwarded 춲10 in compensation. He was told to deliver the shopping. Today he again refused to deliver to my 1st floor flat. This time he was supported both by the call centre and his delivery depot. He took particular delight in his success in winning an argument with a disable 62 year old.  I have been shopping at Sainsburys for many many years..... spending thousands of pounds. No more. I urge ALL people who think this is intolerable discrimination to cease shopping at Sainsburys. This apparent change of policy towards the disabled has no place in a civilised society.

He advised in a very small number of cases the camera will not register a second license plate if the vehicles leaving are too close together however if you pop into store with the ticket and ask for Richard or Bradley at the customer service desk, they will be happy to reimburse you for the cost on this occassion.

They have never said before about this they have been happy to do it but today they talked down to me like I was a 2 year old and that I shouldn t be a picky eater but I don t want to be told that as I am under team to help me try new food and learn to trust food and today I ended up with bread and butter for my lunch as they wouldn t do me any toast as it was after 11:30 so I don t think I would be going back to the cafe at Preston many thanks nadean Bruton;2016-04-08T19:48:03+0000;10154736554969377_10154736910994377;pageowner;0;Sorry you're unhappy Nadean.

It hasn't happened once or twice, it has happened several times even after talking to the 'manager'. If it was just a case of getting a manger to authorise a payment, ok, if that is your policy. However, to be constantly told that 'our manager told us we don't accept these cards' is somewhat wrong, don't you think? You say, correctly, that you do accept them, would you like to tell that to the 'manager' of this store, who for some reason, on Sainsbury's behalf, is discriminating against my husband. You may think or be told that it isn't personal, but I can assure you that when you are being discriminated against, it is. How can I be any clearer?  Chip and signature cards are issued by all UK banks, when requested. The one my husband has is a debit card linked to his bank account. The only difference is that when asked for a PIN the chip communicates to the terminal and a receipt is printed by the system for a signature. No need for the 'our manager told us we don't accept these cards' every time.;2016-04-13T08:28:00+0000;0

Buildings aren't required to have a lift by law, unless they are 5 storeys or more, the buildings below 5 storeys that have a lift ate great, but I would expect the vast majority of multi storey buildings your delivery drivers come across will be without.  Please stop hiding behind ""risk assessments"" as an excuse. Company policy, is company policy; and I understand that a RA is needed to satisfy insurances. However a simple dynamic RA carried out by the driver at the point of work would easily overcome the issue. It's great to hear you're concerned about the wellbeing of your employees, but not of a pregnant customer?

I was at your Huntingdon store today and parked in a child space. I think it is completely out of order that when getting my child back into the car 2 of your members of staff were stood right next to my car smoking. Even though outside you cannot get away from the smell. I said to my husband that it s out of order that my children are inhaling their smoke knowing the staff could hear me and they did not even attempt to move away from us. Surely your staff should not be taking their cigarette breaks right next to the child spaces?;2016-04-07T16:11:29+0000;10154732977169377_10154733136984377;pageowner;0;Sorry about this Nikki, our colleagues should have a smoking area that's away from customers.

But...I'm working on scraping the cupboards for something for lunch...which excitingly so far involves broccoli and Lurpak...游때 but really I should have been able to rely on Sainsburys to deliver the order that I placed, and when there was a problem I'm sure it's easier for them to pick up a few bits for me and deliver them than for them to clear up after a vomiting child if I were to bring them into the store?! Or perhaps just to be helpful, given the circumstances, they could spare someone for a total of  a few minutes to pick the shopping then get one of their delivery drivers to squeeze in the delivery.  I'm sure they're picking and packing tomorrow's deliveries anyway.   It's all about how hard they're prepared to try and help given the circumstances.  I'm hopeful that Maryclare who has responded on here will be able to help.  Fingers crossed!;2016-04-07T10:57:24+0000;1

So please Sainsbury s drop the palm oil I m sure it s  not that necessary.;2016-04-07T08:12:21+0000;10154731956514377_10154731993009377;5521f68231c2ed71a339ec0362d6baf3a0bdcc05;0;Darren, we don't make the food in store we just sell it, I think you need to goto the factories or where every they do produce outdoor and complain there :/ x;2016-04-07T08:35:50+0000;0

I hadnt bought in a while and decided to buy for a change. Followed heating instructions but they tasted very different to how i remember them. The texture and taste seemed a lot dryer. Once you have looked into this I would be interested to know if the recipe has been tweaked to make them lower fat to satisfy consumers looking for healthier lower fat food choices. Personally I have never been a fan of low fat foods as i find them tasteless and not very filling so probably wont be buying these again.;2016-04-06T15:57:04+0000;0

I used my initiative and found the original person dealing with it who gave me a surprise reaction that are you still here problem not sorted yet I said I thought you were sorting it but I was told the responsibility was passed onto member of Tu clothing who thus disappeared with the baby jeans so two unattended call outs were made followed by walk through most of store with customer service staff.

I purchased a packet yesterday from Sainsbury s Bristol Hippodrome cause I needed a little tapioca pick-me-up. To my horror when I opened the packet of prawn goodness they were soiled!!! There were brown speckles in amongst the prawn happiness. As mentioned earlier I love prawn crackers  so I ate them. Some may call me a fool and today I woke up to realise- they would be right. The crackers have made me very ill indeed. I am hurt both physically and emotionally.   Yours Sincerely    Liz Gorny;2016-04-05T16:50:55+0000;10154727046319377_10154727308734377;pageowner;0;Oh no Liz! I'm very sorry about this. Can you send us over the barcode from the packaging please?

Your store is open until late at night so why are you running out of stock before the day is even half over?? Poor planning  lack of knowledge on how a successful convenience store works and a complete lack of understanding of what your core customer base requires.

However, if you watch the video on the link I posted, the problem is that we are producing more and more plastic and 'recycling' it doesn't count because it is, effectively, still a plastic product to add to all the new plastic being created.   I know in Germany the law means that consumers can leave their unwanted packaging at the supermarket and then it must be disposed of sustainably - but using it as fuel doesn't count...that would be a great idea in the UK, but unlikely to happen unless it becomes law!;2016-04-05T12:41:32+0000;0

We phased out use of our single-use carrier bags in England in October 2015 with thicker, reusable bags meaning our customers can re-use the bags that they bought for 5p instead of disposing of them after a single use. It mirrors our strategy in Scotland and Wales, and also reflects our ambition to actually reduce the number of single-use bags that are currently in circulation. You can find out more here: http://bit.ly/1lXRn8l under 'Packaging'. I've also logged your feedback and concerns for the attention of the relevant team to review.

This year the vouchers are printed through the catalina printers along with other coupons and till vouchers such as Brand Match and money off coupons. If you're not automatically receiving these vouchers from the tills then you'll need to speak to a colleague at the customer service desk where they can perform a workaround for you. That way you'll start receiving the vouchers. Hope this helps, Amanda.;2016-04-05T12:48:30+0000;0

Over this time we have learnt that no farm is the same (climate, land availability, soil type). This means that the housing period of cattle can vary from all year round to below 3 months. Our aim is to work with our farmer members to maximize health and welfare in all dairy farming systems. We achieve this through setting clear health and welfare targets for each farmer to meet. These standards are higher than red tractor farm assurance, and are independently audited by an independent veterinary consultancy. Thanks, Debs.;2016-04-07T11:55:11+0000;0

Only one voucher should be issued per department per Nectar card, so I'm really sorry the colleague made a mistake and issued you another one. Usually they can't be added back on to your card, however I'm glad the store managed to sort this for you on this occasion. Could you PM the store you were in and a description of the colleague? I'll make sure this is fed back. Leigh;2016-04-04T16:35:40+0000;0

It's the east mayne site in Basildon and I did notice a few weeks back the sainsburys branded meals were all being sold on the cheap but thought nothing of it.   I can't locate the sainsburys meals on the website at all but the ones saying 'introductory offer' are all I see on the shelves (plus the usual anabell karmel stuff that's always there)   If it is the case that sainsburys have opted to stock the same meals as tescos etc then it's a real shame as I personally feel that for a ready meal your own brand was far superior.;2016-04-04T15:41:42+0000;0

They are not currently produced for supermarkets, so a whole new production line would need to be created, they are heavier to carry and bulkier to store , and would take up more space in landfill, while waiting to break down.  I  regularly have shopping delivered, and am aware of the time pressures on the drivers, I  unload the delivery crates on the hall floor , by the front door,  just takes minutes, then the driver is free to go, and,I am free to transfer the shopping to my kitchen, taking as much time as I  want ..how unkind to make  a driver wait 45 minutes , bet that person would be complaining if their own delivery  was late !;2016-04-04T15:49:12+0000;2

We are moving in together soon and are on the hunt for household items on the cheap  so imagine our amazement when we saw a Hoover reduced from 춲120 to 춲50  and with the value of points doubled up this would have cost us 춲10! Yes  춲10 for a 춲120 Hoover! So off we skip to the customer services really pleased with our discovery (it was the last one on the shelf) to get the points converted only to be met with  Ah  you havent shopped in this store before have you?   No we haven t  we are out for the day and popped in for some bits on our way home   was our reply.  I m sorry but we can t redeem your points in this store for 24hrs after your card has been swiped   What??  We reply in unison! Completely shocked that we can gain nectar points almost anywhere but when it comes to spending them we actually are quite restricted. How can a supermarket as big as Sainsburys have such restrictions on the redemption of the points that the customer has quite rightly earned!! Poor show Sainsburys!! Great way to look after loyalty!!

I see the camera I want on display  as usual no one was serving on the entertainment/click and collect counter. a customer was waiting  apparently he had time to stand and wait...I didn t with 4 children waiting to go home for their dinner. so off i went to the  customer service  dept. the man serving is always helpful  if not a tad surly  can you help me please  I want to double up my points and buy a camera  there is no one on the counter.  he called for someone. in the meantime I asked hijm  if the camera is not in stock can it be ordered if I pay in advance for the camera using my double up nectar points and cash?   you can only use your double up points if the camera arrives before the end of tuesday ..so even if I pay in advance if it doesn t arrive I cant use my double up vouchers?...no...fab customer service there sainsburys im prepared to buy a 춲130 camera  pay in advance and you wont let me.....anyway the person he called from the entertainment dept took me back to the cameras and told me  its not in stock... can you sell me the display model?  ... no ...can you order one for me?...no?...I explained the double up vouchers situation...  well you could try ordering using click and collect ..can I pay when I collect then?...no...so I have to pay online?...yes....can I pay with double up vouchers online?...no...well  that wont work then will it...(I will point out I was very patient and polite  if not extremely frustrated  throughout.  ok  can you tell me if its in stock anywhere else please...yes..he checked...there is one in stock in Godalming...I have no idea where that is is there one anywhere else at all...no  that s the only one in our region...time to find out where Godalming is then...SUNDAY..into Godalming at 10.30..someone from the phone area quickly appeared at the click and collect counter...I explained what I was looking for and that id been told one is in stock..hmmm  I don t know where they are kept  I will find someone...off she went  whilst we waited. she returned shortly afterwards with another member of staff and they faffed about with cupboard keys...and we went to the cupboard...there was much searching of said  cupboard and a bo appeared  here it is and she was about to hand it to me...I pointed out it had  display box  written on the side..oh no  its not its in here..and she checked..yep no camera its on display...and you cant sell me the display model?...no......explained the previous store had checked record and they showed you had one in stock...oh  well that would be the display model...the one you cant sell me...yes...at this point I gave up.. annoyingly aware that a.

As you advised in your original post, this wasn't done for you and it shouldn't have been done for your husband as the system is not configured to accept them in this form. If you ever forget your card, you can always pop to the customer service desk on your next visit with your receipt and Nectar card where they'll add the points on for you.

If you are wondering why we were at 2 tills,  our sons were bag packing for scouts at 2 different tills and they each asked us to go to their one. Anyway, it's a pointless thing to have done  and your staff clearly do not understand it fully either. You clearly do have the tech capability for it to happen manually. It happened today. Feedback given. You have the store name, Edinburgh Craigleith, the date was today,  Sunday 3rd April. Should be perfectly straightforward to pass on everything that needs to be without targeting individuals, and rather than taking away people's ability to keep their pockets and bags light (they can,  after all,  use their phone to pay) perhaps sainsburys could let the staff know that they CAN enter it manually.

We aren't looking to get anyone in trouble, we just want to ensure that all of our colleagues are following the policy so that there is no confusion or problems for our customers. As this is now standard policy, our colleagues won't be able to accept your Nectar card unless you swipe it at the checkout when paying for shopping.

I don't have a photo of the best before date because we've thrown the watery gas away and didn't think of that, though to be fair the first customer service person we spoke to didn't suggest that.

I'm afraid you would need to return the product to store. As the product was so far out of date, store management would need to investigate how this happened. The store can trace a transaction using your credit/debit card or Nectar card numbers, so you wouldn't necessarily have to take a bank statement in. Thanks, Naomi.;2016-04-08T12:08:46+0000;0

We're committed to offering great quality food at fair prices which is sourced with integrity. We regularly review our prices to make sure we offer value for money whilst remaining competitive and we work hard to negotiate great deals with our suppliers. Although we try to keep our pricing as fair as possible sometimes prices can go up as well as down. There are lots of factors which can affect pricing, from rising costs of raw materials, to the production and packaging and even transportation. Whilst we try to absorb these increases for as long as possible, sometimes we eventually have to put the price up. Danny.;2016-04-03T13:28:54+0000;1

We have various vouchers that can be used online or in-store and the reason why you sometimes receive in-store vouchers with your delivery is because we like to reward our customers for shopping with us through every channel. With the triple point voucher, we wouldn't expect you to make a special trip and that's why the voucher is usable over a period of time. I've made sure however to log your comments for the attention of our marketing team regarding the types of vouchers sent out for when we review our loyalty program. I hope you have a lovely evening!
