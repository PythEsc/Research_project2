As there has been a sale which ended recently (Monday), they will have used this discretion to offer you a refund less 25%. We can accept debit or credit card statements showing the date and value of the transaction, so if you can pop in with one of those we can look up your proof of purchase and offer a full refund or exchange. I hope this answers your question. Ryan.;2016-09-30T20:55:00+0000;0

But as Ryan from sainsburys has kindly pointed out it is a discretionary thing, which the store chose  to impose, and therefore not all stores will do this which is probably the reason the reasons why I haven't come across this before :-);2016-10-01T10:20:12+0000;0

Your employees at this store couldn t have been anymore but brilliant  helping my nan in anyway that they could until the ambulance arrived  she is ever so grateful for all your help and also a member of the public (an off duty police office) who stopped the escalator and kept my nan calm and stopped to help the bleeding  I couldn t thank you enough and I would love to say a Massive thank you from the bottom of my heart that what you did.   To the two ladies that rushed to my nan to help her with first aid thank you very much. My nan spent a long day in a&e  but now home safe and sound.   I know that this post might not ever be seen but I would like it to reach the people that helped her today and my whole family are very very grateful ❤️ also if this could reach the off duty police office that pretty much saved her hand I would love to thank you in person!

I was really impressed to see your new vegan cheese range; which you advertise as also suitable for those allergic to milk.  I went into store today to buy some  only to discover that they all have soya in them. Allergy to cows  milk and allergy to soya are very closely linked; 50% of those with a cows  milk allergy are also allergic to soya.  So  unfortunately  I couldn t buy any of your products. It seems a shame that a coconut based product has soya added to it.  Please could you investigate whether or not soya is an essential ingredient in these products? I m sure I m not the only one disappointed.  Thanks.";2016-09-30T17:43:42+0000;10155273332074377_10155273608434377;pageowner;0;Hi, Katie! Sorry you're disappointed.

Cashiers have to keep a minimum amount of notes in their tills. Its very possible that cashier just did a till flight and had the minimum amount left. They would need to start giving coins away as change for anything under £10 to allow notes to build up. Otherwise their tills will be empty. ....Besides notes or coins, its money. It all gets spent the same way. Chill.;2016-09-30T17:31:34+0000;0

My main priority should have been getting my little boy to the car to sort him out. However  as there was a big puddle on the floor and nobody offering to clean it up  I had to wait with the trolly over the  spillage  whilst a Sainsbury s worker took forever to pass me the odd small piece of paper towel to mop it up myself.  I m not saying I expect other people to mop up my child s accidents. However  given the stressful situation and how extremely embarrassed I was  I d of maybe expected someone to either  provide a sufficient amount of paper towels to be able to get the job done and go quickly  rather than leaving me stood there for 10 minutes. Or... Offer to put a wet floor sign down and to go and get my child sorted given he should come first.

My order number is 2901799 I'm most annoyed because one of the items is a ballet skirt for my little girl which was looking for in-store but could not get.  When I managed to order one for her online she was so happy and looking forward to getting it.  Unfortunately the rubbish excuse for it not arriving doesn't wash with a 3yr old 😞😞😞;2016-10-01T11:30:59+0000;0

I have looked into your account and can see a refund was processed on the 29/09/16, which will reach your account in the next 3-5 working days.  This happens when a multiple of orders are placed within the same time frame so once the warehouse start to pick and package parcels, they don't have enough stock.  Items online are subject to availability as we're not a live site. However, I totally understand this may be frustrating for you and I apologise for any inconvenience caused. If you'd like me to search stores near yourself that may have availability, please let me know. Thanks, Megan.;2016-10-03T09:23:25+0000;0

I have already checked my local store which does not have the items instock.  I do not feel it shuld be up to me to now treck to stores further afield in order to source the two items which have been canceled from my order (to have to pay the  full price and the fuel costs) What you have explained makes sense,  although you must understand how frustrating and dissapointing this situation is to customers.  I appreciate that TU online is a relatively new concept,  however there are obviously improvements in the technology and learnings to be made in order for TU online to offer the same service as other online retailers.  As a consumer I buy a lot of products online from many different retailers and have never been in this situation before.  I find it surprising that Sainsbury are happy to let their customers down in this manor without a goodwill gesture of any nature for the inconvenience.  I'm a very unhappy customer and I won't be ordering from TU online again 😕;2016-10-03T09:58:50+0000;0

Many thanks.;2016-09-29T13:01:59+0000;10155269342889377_10155270492634377;3da567213115ae5bcb2c81f2f8beb826412e3c6a;0;You need to make your own stuff Hun, then u know for sure whats in it.

Although mentioned by many as of course great for vegan  the packaging and initial release actually have it as part of a freefrom range  aimed primarily at being free from allergens. Being coconut based therefore made great sense and was welcome news after so many simpky lactose free or soya based cheeses. Imagine our disappointment to then discovet that despite its coconut base  it still contains soya. Not only is soya one of the  big 8  allergens (so common to suffer from)  it s proteins ate very similar to those in cows milk. This means a high percentage of those who cannot have cows milk also cannot have soya. What a shame that this wasnt considered begore adding soya proteins to your coconut based cheeses that could have been such a wonderful find for all the allergy sufferers and carers of allergy sufferers. I commend sainsburys on their extensive free from range. Just feel disappointed that  despite being one if the big 8 allergens  soya allergies are yet again being overlooked.;2016-09-28T22:42:22+0000;10155267357344377_10155269576784377;pageowner;0;Hi there Joanna, I'm sorry your're not happy with our new range.

And while these cheeses are suitable for vegans, they are not suitable gor a high percentage of those that the packaging suggests they are aimed at, allergy sufferers.

And its proteins are so similar to cows milk proteins that a high percentage of those with a cows milk allergy will have a soya allergy. I get that not all products can be free of all allergens. However the only allergen in cheese is milk. So looking at milk allergy suffers predominantly when developing an alternative. Knowledgr that most of those people will be allergic to soya is important. There are many allergy/vegan cheeses in existance that are soya based. If the decision is made to make a coconut based one, it wouldn't take much extra research to realise not having soya in that would open it up to a bigger market. X;2016-09-29T06:22:27+0000;3

Lots of people cut out foods for lifestyle choice. Like carb free diets or cutting out gluten because it makes them healthy. A lady above knocked the nail on the head if an allergy sufferer eats whatever they are allergic to they could potentially die as a result. A vegan will not necessarily die from eating a non vegan product. My son has allergies and I can honestly say that given how many people and especially children and babies there is a serious lack of free from foods and most definitely a lack of foods that are free from more than 1 thing. Very few of the free from foods are something a child would be very interested in and I feel there is a huge gap in the market for food for children especially with allergies.

Their current security guard has always been somewhat of a strange person; every time I ve walked into the store and he s been there  he s always made me feel incredibly uncomfortable - following me around to closely observing me and Where I m putting the groceries (either in plain sight in my hand or in plain sight in my shopping basket!)   At first I thought that perhaps I was being hyper sensitive... and then yesterday happened; I was shopping in the chilled foods section when I caught him glaring at me. This continued as I scanned for something for dinner. Now you may think that he is simply doing his job  but is it a part of his job description to have stoodroght  beside me as I shopped? Looking at me lifting different pots as I tried to decide what to take home? He unapologetically invaded my space and my shopping experience... and for what? Based upon which clues? Is walking into a store sufficient enough evidence to prove a thief? If so  I bet he s a very busy man... or not  as yesterday s incident would have dictated.  During this time in the store I felt compelled to hold my items out in front of me  almost unnaturally distant from myself... as though to prove I m not a criminal. I even begun to question my appearance (did a rucksack and a beige mac over a black dress and pearled earrings scream thief?) But then I stopped myself  right there  at that thought! Why can t I dress as I choose and spend my legally earned money on groceries whenever I want to?!   I complained as soon as I got home - I felt uncomfortable complaining in the store (and for someone who is rather confident  that in itself felt like a defeat!) The duty manager was understanding and explained that this wasn t the first complaint - I had been right with my initial reaction to his bully-like tactics! He told me he d follow this up... and I hope so.   How dare he  a man who does not know me  a man who has been given absolutely no reason to suspect me  a man who is a small minded bully  be allowed to make me so uncomfortable that I never want to shop in that store again?...  I went back this evening  after work still wearing my work badge. The sad thing is  I wanted him to see I was a professional. The sad thing is  today I wanted him to judge me in a positive way - encouraging the idea that professionals do not demonstrate antisocial behaviour. The sad thing is  I let him win today.   I won t be going back to that store. The staff are incredibly welcoming and helpful. However  the presence of this judgemental bully is too much to bear. Tesco is another 3 minute walk - an insignificant distance that allows me access to an invaluable shopping experience  to shop freely without judgement.";2016-09-28T19:46:23+0000;10155266968389377_10155269359714377;pageowner;0;Hi there Joyti, I'm very sorry you've been made to feel this way.

Thank you Debs! Is there a reason why it's not stated on the packaging? I'm so disappointed as I really like smoked cheese.  Especially since it's an 'own brand' Sainsbury's product. I really would of expected clearer labelling from a retail giant such as Sainsbury's. Ah well.;2016-09-29T13:30:13+0000;0

The cheese and onion how it is applied must of been changed  as is not slopped out the back anymore soaking the packaging and more important to that  not falling onto my lap when you take a bite! However  may I ask why the BLT has been dropped from the meal deal? and why the tuna is as dry as a bone now. What happened to tuna mayo? It looks like now the tuna  is put on top of the mayo. Not a good a move  a tuna mayo is just that tuna mixed with mayo. I love your variety please re-consider the tuna!

Yesterday at your Hawick store on the 26th September at 15:20pm I went and did my usual shop which came to £43 the large bearded sweet chewing man at the till scanned the coupon and informed me that i could not use it as i had a bottle of spirits in my shopping? I explained that i always bought a bottle of spirits with my shopping and the coupon has always been scanned and accepted he flatly refused stating that it says so on the coupon no alcohol which it does. This man was rude and unprofessional in the fact he kept repeating that I was `wrong mate` until i politely told him it was not his position to keep calling me wrong he also kept waving customers away from his till telling them in a loud cynical voice that there was a dispute here and it was going to take a while which was very embarrassing and humiliating for me and my wife. When the manageress turned up she looked and said no even though i had explained as before to the till operator that i have used these in this store the exact same way and for years in other stores and have always been accepted with a bottle of spirits included in my shopping. All in all we left the shopping with the manageress in our shopping bags and she kept our coupon.   Why after all these years have i been getting the same kind of shop with the same coupons and have always been accepted?Me and my wife were humiliated in front of all the other customers by this loud mouthed till operator who could have handled the matter a bit more maturely other than acting like a spoiled child not getting his way.

This man was rude and unprofessional in the fact he kept repeating that I was `wrong mate` until i politely told him it was not his position to keep calling me wrong he also kept waving customers away from his till telling them in a loud cynical voice that there was a dispute here and it was going to take a while which was very embarrassing and humiliating for me and my wife. When the manageress turned up she looked and said no even though i had explained as before to the till operator that i have used these in this store the exact same way and for years in other stores and have always been accepted with a bottle of spirits included in my shopping. All in all we left the shopping with the manageress in our shopping bags and she kept our coupon.   Why after all these years have i been getting the same kind of shop with the same coupons and have always been accepted?Me and my wife were humiliated in front of all the other customers by this loud mouthed till operator who could have handled the matter a bit more maturely other than acting like a spoiled child not getting his way.  We will not be returning to your your stores and I will make it my passion to tell everybody about our bad experience in your store i will teach my children to never enter your stores as they are bad places so you will never get any more money from this family ever.;2016-09-27T12:54:30+0000;10155262732529377_10155265941879377;464bd3ab80b2330788f5355cef3e375c54e2e05a;1;Beers count towards the threshold.

In regards to these type of coupons, spirits and liqueurs are exceptions in our T&Cs. This is due to government legislation which you can read more about here: http://bit.ly/1nTIf4l.  Therefore you must reach the minimum spend on the coupon minus spirits and liqueurs. For example, for this particular coupon, your whole grocery shop must be over £40 not including spirits or liqueurs. Was your full shop without these items over this amount?  Additionally, I must apologise for the nature in which this was dealt with in store and I will ensure this is fed back to the store's management to address. Amanda.;2016-09-28T16:21:07+0000;0

My reply to this email got no response (2 days ago). I called customer service today and after a bit of explaining was promised to be 'called back in few minutes' which was over an hour ago. Unfortunately I don't have time to wait for a call all day.  I also don't fancy calling the customer service again and again (I asked if I am paying for the call, as I was 'on hold' for a while  and the answer was 'I am not sure').  Who do I need to call/email/message to finally get my money back, for real this time??;2016-09-29T12:31:24+0000;0

I'd like to get this sorted out ASAP for you. I'm having a look at your account at the moment. You mention that you were double charged for your order resulting in a charge of £167.72, can you confirm that your order total should have been £83.86 in this case? Also, do you still have your receipt from this order? If so, please PM me a picture of this so I can try and get this resolved. Brad;2016-09-30T07:12:24+0000;0

Some gluten free items cost more due to lots of factors, such as production methods, but I understand this is frustrating, especially with a little one to think of!

Customer satisfaction is of paramount importance to us and it's never our intention to give you cause to complain.

Rest assured we'll be able to get this resolved for you. My colleague is right in saying that if you paid by bank card, you can use your bank statement as a proof of purchase, this will be the exact same as presenting a receipt. To confirm, did you purchase the blender using a bank card? Chris.;2016-09-26T13:36:48+0000;0

Then if you go back to favourites after clicking on an item you're taken all the way back to the top and have to start all over again. I have over 200 favourites so this is really annoying. I also have problems when adjusting the number of items in my basket. If I add more, it registers on the screen but then at some point it must remove it because it doesn't show up with my delivery.  I'd love to see an app. Ocado lead the way on this one and sometimes I use them knowing it will be a lot quicker, even though I prefer Sainsbury's products.;2016-09-26T16:07:07+0000;0

I think that s the way forward. What disturbs and confuses me  is why you continue to stock John West tuna! Greenpeace tell me that they still use Fish Aggregating Devices which also attract species like sharks  turtles and rays  meaning they re caught as  bycatch . I m also told they haven t met their promise and commitment to using 100% sustainable fishing methods by 2016... that they re only at 2%!!! By my maths that s 98% unsustainable fishing practise on a global scale! If Tesco s and Waitrose have already agreed to put pressure on John West to meet their commitments  why aren r Sainsbury s adding their voice to this argument? Why are Sainsbury s still stocking a product that seems to go against their ethos?  Please can someone explain your reason to continue to support and stock John West tuna?;2016-09-26T10:13:29+0000;10155259079744377_10155259286114377;3d5cac60ec0cc76e5d9c8a75046d2f812e33c550;0;Waitrose and Tesco are still selling JW tuna...true they're ' putting pressure' on them to clean up their act and until they do they wont be ordering anymore tuna...fwiw, Tesco and waitrose may have had contracts with JW that allowed them to back out or it may have simply expired enabling them to put pressure on JW...it perhaps isn't the case with Sainsburys, and quite frankly, whatever the reason...their business practices are nothing to do with any of us.;2016-09-26T11:57:37+0000;0

As we all know the cooking of roast dinners is all in the timing and I cooked our Sunday roast according to the packet instructions and timings. However after the prescribed cooking time  I found that my chicken still had pink juices  so I cooked it for a further 15 minutes. Again I checked and after this it still had pink juices  so again I cooked it for another 15 minutes. By this point all the other parts of the dinner were ready and I had to remove them from the oven to save them being too over cooked! After the final 15 minutes the juices weren t clear but I d had enough so removed the chicken from the oven - as by this time it was getting late and everyone was getting impatient!  It was upon carving the chicken that I found the problem - all of the offal remained inside the chicken (including the contents of the chickens stomach 😱😷) Now I m not one to complain but I couldn t actually eat the chicken after this and neither could my partner or children. By this time we had all the makings of a roast dinner (albeit a little overdone and a little late) so I had to send my partner to McDonald s for chicken fillets (no offal included) as the shops were no longer open and I didn t have time to cook another chicken!

Yesterday (Sunday) afternoon when I was leaving your store my son unwittingly stepped in dog diarrhea (told by a member of the public) then as his shoe was slippy for the mess he slipped and fell into some of the afore mentioned diarrhea. When I went inside to tell the manager all I got was in a very disinterested voice  oh sorry - I ll get a cleaner  no offer of even a wipe to help tidy my son up.   It was the same member of the public too that told me that she had also asked for a cleaner - but obviously you hadn t bothered to tidy it up - or my son wouldn t have stepped in it - and now he wouldn t be being violently ill.   We ve had to bin his clothes he was wearing at the time and his shoes he was wearing too.;2016-09-26T01:34:02+0000;10155258035564377_10155268988334377;a19ad7b0d2c24b07ce439dc541cd018e139c320b;0;I have messaged you please respond.;2016-09-29T10:06:29+0000;0

I ordered the vegetarian lasagne  paid and sat down. A staff member came over 5 minutes later to advise me that they had run out of veg lasagne and would I like to pick something else  I went to the menu board to pick my second option only two hear the staff member chatting with the lady who initially served me at the till. The lady from the till advised the kitchen lady that there were intact some veg lasagne left but they were in the freezer  to which the other staff remember replied  yes but I can t be bothered with all that hassle  absolutely diabolical behaviour. I was then asked to quickly pick another option!!! I picked a jacket potato with prawn cocktail which was beyond horrendous!!! The jacket potato must have been reheated numerous times  the skin was chewy/rubbery and the potato very dry  and as for the prawn cocktail there were only 5 prawns!!! I am disgusted and will definitely not be eating or recommending here again! Please retrain your staff in regards to manners  standards and good food!;2016-09-25T22:09:52+0000;10155257494749377_10155258731244377;pageowner;0;Hey Louise,  sorry about this!

Our online team manager Millie called you at 10.37am but was unsuccessful and left you a voicemail - they were calling to advise that they had processed your full refund for you, and this was overseen by another member of the management team. Can you please advise me who offered you the refund initially? We're trying to get to the bottom of the miscommunication situation. I can confirm the store refunded £161.05 this morning at around 8.30am. Your funds will be with you in 3-5 working days depending on your banking provider. Also, I've been speaking with our Executive Office. One of the team is going to give you a call this evening. Ryan.;2016-09-26T16:57:33+0000;0

The usual Sunday morning gossip with my friend Beth abruptly ended with her screaming for help!!! A call back 10 (very tense) mins later revealed that whilst in the car park and sheltering from the rain she stumbled into a wasps nest and was stung on the eye. As she s had a bad reaction to a bee sting in the past she panicked  a member of the public responded to her cries for help and took her into your Wilmslow branch of Sainsbury s.   A first aider (Vicky) was immediately sought and they began to calm her down. As I rushed to the store to meet my friend  her face began to swell and get worse and so paramedics were called. When I got there and whilst waiting for paramedics  not only was Vicky calm but she managed to keep Beth calm and smiling too. She s was eventually checked over by the paramedic and given the all clear.   And so I wanted to say thank you  not only were Vicky and the manager (could have been called Dan!) calm themselves  they went above and beyond to make sure that my friend was kept calm and looked after  they also were accommodating to my 7 year old daughter who was a little upset at seeing our friend looking a little bit swollen and worse for wear!   They are a credit to your Wilmslow store and I hope they get to see this message on behalf of Beth (who doesn t do social media for some crazy reason!) myself and my 7 year old who is now full of starburst 😘 xxx;2016-09-25T12:49:55+0000;10155255801089377_10155256030759377;pageowner;0;Hi Katie, Beth and Starburst kid!

Without missing a beat  and yet again without so much as a glance at my face  I am told  You need ID  (once again  I remind you that this person has not seen my face). Not  Sorry  do you have any identification?   no.  You NEED ID   I chuckle  and inform the lady who has still not looked at me that I don t generally carry proof of age  what with being over a decade older than is required.  The woman FINALLY graces me with a glance  but only to tell me that (and I quote)...   Well  you are rather short  I can t serve you!   Needless to say  I think you may need to teach your staff that height is not concurrent with age. Neither is it good customer service to not only not look at the person they are being paid to serve  but to pass judgement on said customer s age without looking at their face  and basing it purely on their height.  Yes  at 5 3   I may not be statuesque  but a quick glance at my wrinkles and the onset of grey hair is enough to tell you I m slightly more aged than a teenager. Of course  you d have to train your staff to actually look up for that.;2016-09-24T17:46:43+0000;10155253075704377_10155258700809377;43dc39810b757b868b7cc2fbe20be25375596e03;0;I was just gonna say...

One low grade product with no sprinkler! If this is way Sainsbury's is heading with all the items they sell there is no point shopping there. Aldi, Lidl and other budget food stores would be a much better option. I have shopped at Sainsbury's for years for quality products at reasonable prices, but if it's going to dumb down to the same cut price low grade produce level, they will not compete but merely drive customers like me away.

We have made this informed decision following discussions with customers who have said they are more likely to use a teaspoon to measure a certain amount from recipes, sprinkle onto foods with or pinch smaller quantities direct from the jar. Therefore we have developed a jar with a wider neck which is easy to use with a teaspoon and we have added a clear label which is easy to find on the shelf and in customers’ cupboards or drawers. We have also tested this jar out with customers in their own homes to which we received great feedback on the functionality. Allie;2016-09-24T18:44:02+0000;1

I will never go back will make a point of telling my neighbours and friends.;2016-09-24T15:23:41+0000;10155252627854377_10155253222274377;374b80d3c13237545ae24ebfb397bddcb3617765;0;I assume they have more customers than you. Yet they are consistently rude even though you've been twice in a year. Could it be you aren't as great as you think you are. Just a thought.;2016-09-24T18:40:16+0000;0

So obviously this time I went straight to the coinstar, to be told I could have just traded it at a till. Meaning I spent 55p (not life threatening, but still annoying.) for no reason? To me it seems that when I first went in, the woman just couldn't be asked to change my coins up, understandable as for all I know she could have had a bad day, but that doesn't mean to misinform a customer 😂 Sorry for the frustration in my former message, and thank you for replying.;2016-09-24T15:32:08+0000;0

He decided that his job was to interrogate me  then dictate to me how the lunchbox broke and that he wouldn t be giving me a refund.

I had brought wipes and towels out to wipe the trolley down but when I came back the lady at checkouts (Tracey) had sanitised the seat for me and sorted it all out.

It'd be more honest to have just put the price up. I guess you have to post a scripted answer which is fair enough, but if your management are reading then this is to them.  Stop asking your staff to post BS on your behalf. We know and they probably know that the answer given is crap. Repeating a lie which you appear to be doing doesn't become a truth if you keep saying it! It is not better value at all. How can it be when the meal I used to get, now costs at least a fiver? Anyway. You've lost me as a customer. I'll go boots and yeah, I'll pay more but they're not lying to me. Goodnight and enjoy your Horlicks. 😉;2016-09-23T22:48:56+0000;0

Not happy. I assume that you've done this so that people don't have to take the chicken in its foil container out of the bag and contaminatesurfaces with salmonella? Unfortunately, the bagged chicken that we bought had a leaking bag. My wife didn't realise until she found several items covered in liquid. She checked our shopping bag, found the liquid in the bottom, checked the chicken (now on a worktop in a pool of the stuff) and then suffered it dripping across the kitchen floor as she carried it to the sink. The floor had to be mopped, the worktops disinfected along with the shopping bag and the other items. It also dripped down her jeans butshe's managed to sponge those clean. Needless to say we won't be buying them any more, it will be M&S or our butchers from now on.;2016-09-23T20:12:52+0000;0

The meal for £10 offer has ceased  which is a pity  but the knock on effect is that the range of Taste the Difference desserts have reduced in number.  Earlier in the year there was a range of Taste the Difference meals for one.  One in particular was extremely good  ie chicken with mushroom and Marsala sauce.  There are now no TTD meals for one on the shelves despite featuring on your website.  In passing I would also mention the range of TTD jams appear to have been reduced.

Apologies that the voucher wasn't suitable this time round - but I'll make sure you get use of it - don't you worry!

We had a change in policy at the start of the year where we decided not to accept digitally stored Nectar cards as previously some of our tills were unable to read certain barcodes, however all tills in the new format will be able to scan all barcodes and all types of phone - great news! We only recently changed our policy around this to allow this to be done once again. You'll now be able to scan your own phone at the self-service and our colleagues will be able to use the handheld scanners at the manned checkouts however our colleagues will only ever handle your phone in the event you are unable to scan it yourself. Can you send me a snap of the bottom of your receipt? I'd like to make sure the store manager knows about your experience. Ryan.;2016-09-23T14:58:09+0000;0

I also purchased a 5p bag. Anyway I went home and my daughter was so excited to see her haloween costume so we pulled it out of the bag to find a slug drop from it  she was horrified screaming I then looked in to the carrier bag to find another slug! I contacted the store straight away to which the guy was speechless and told me to come down he would replace the items and also refund them. Anyway heading down to the store I was seen by a lady that was very helpful told me to go and see if the sizes were available on the shop floor  the deputy manager then came down  he was saying it s either a refund or a exchange  but only wanted to do this with the costume. I explained my children. Would not be wearing something that had slugs over it so he said as a good will gesture he would refund it all. Not only he told me it was just only a slug!!!

The first one I chose was sticky and looked like it had always been left in the rain. It had rust on it and the metal looked like it needed a good scrub. When I went to change it hoping it was a one off all of the others were the same!   Really not good when you have a newborn and want to do some shopping. I really did not feel comfortable using these trolleys with my daughter. To be honest I even doubt a good scrub would get rid of the muck on these trolleys. I really would suggest some new ones be purchased and they be kept inside the trolley bays!   They really were disgusting!;2016-09-23T07:56:11+0000;10155248080669377_10155249144309377;pageowner;0;Hi James, I'm sorry about the experience you've had in our store.

Head office have said that had I put these single lollies in a fruit/veg bag they would have been removed and bag confiscated. What a joke when I put trolly back, the trolly in front had 2 empty disgarded fruit/veg bags in it. H/O also said that it is company policy not goverment. Anyway regardless of whose policy it is , this was pure jobsworth as far as I am concered. So in future my plan will be to buy loose apples instead of bagged, and put each apple ( 6 to 8 ) in a single free bag, then I will put lolly or chew in with each apple after they are scanned. I do realise that this will cause more work for cashier as each apple will have to be weighed. But hey ho that's life and it will solve my problem Thanks regards Julie x;2016-09-23T14:52:03+0000;0

Having spent a total of £45 on shopping I asked cashier if I could have a little bag to put the sweets in. The answer was NO we only allow the little see through bags for raw meat and fish. So I gave the sweets back in protest! I understand she was  Doing  her job  as she quoted BUT is there no common sense in place?  NOT a happy customer and if I had the time I would have given all shopping back and gone to Tesco !;2016-09-23T07:54:45+0000;10155248078644377_10155248441809377;75603d4f44130f2d1905ba9af1bec2c6aaf65594;0;I think Angela Bradley that you have misunderstood my post. I was asking for a bag like you would put loose veg or fruit in which are free.  Not a 5p bag. But although the bags are free because it was not meat or fish she refused to give me one. So I do not think she was correct. What I should have done in hindsight was to have put the sweets in one of the free veg/fruit bags myself and made her take them out to scan .;2016-09-23T10:51:01+0000;1

But when I said this to head office. I was told that cashier would take sweets out of bag and confiscate the bag as the bag is for fruit and veg NOT confectionery. Lol.

On 10th September 2016.. The warning letter was from Euro Car Parks  whom you employ.  Your Newbury Store has seen the letter and the proof that the car is registered disabled  and my wife's disability badge.  Your customer services seemed more interested in telling me the rules and ignoring my complaint. She said come to customer services when you come in next time. I told her I will not be coming in again. She seemed totally disinterested with what I had to say and this just puts me off coming back in. I drive past Tesco to come to your store and that's how you treat people Same applies to the assistant in your restaurant and I would also add that the cutlery had not been washed properly and still had dried food on it so I had to fetch more .I have since then used Tesco on 9 occasions so far;2016-09-23T13:16:07+0000;0

Have been shopping with Tesco for a little while due to your products having ridiculously short use by dates. Tried Sainsbury s again and tonight we have been charged about £20 more than we expected!

Partially defrosted frozen food on nearly every delivery but worse in evening. Poor selection of meat and vegetables. Twin packs of steak are not 2 x single packs but one big and one small steak. Assumptions about modern households perhaps.  The weirdest one was a packer who chose giant vegetables although amusing not helpful. Customer services 30+ minutes wait. Xmas year before last although ordered weeks in advance no turkey but a fantastically expensive one offered instead. Could do much better;2016-09-21T17:37:10+0000;10155242366569377_10155244836804377;pageowner;0;I'm really sorry, Milly! Can you PM me your order number? I'll look into this for you.

I went up to the counter today to buy some other meat and I commented to the lady about how I was disappointed with the new kind and she agreed and said yes its not as good and they have had loads of complaints and the feedback has been that the old kind was seemingly a cut above the rest of the supermarkets so it's a shame there has been a few disappointed customers. The lady told me about this page and suggested I write on here so maybe something can be done??!! To be honest I'm not in the habit of writing posts about chopped pork lol!

I filled my car with diesel and the pump did not cut out properly. Some diesel came out of the filler hole and splashed onto the side of the car and the ground  and a little on my feet.  I mentioned it to the lady in the petrol station and she could not have been more helpful and caring. She immediately took me to the toilets to clean up my feet. She asked me if I needed to replace any of my clothes or my shoes and offered to escort me to the store to get new ones if necessary. She wanted to fill in forms to record the incident  but the splash was so small I did not feel it was necessary. She gave me some money off my bill for the fuel which had ended up on the floor instead of in my tank.   I was unfortunate enough to have a similar experience at Tesco 5 years or so ago  and my experience was completely the reverse. The staff person there - and even the manager who I had to insist was called - could not care less  and on that occasion I ended up driving to A&E in floods of tears.

Sainsbury e-book folk were so lovely to deal with, prices were excellent AND got nectar points as well.  I may just have to go back to real books.;2016-09-21T16:09:49+0000;0

Last Thursday the 15th of September I was packed and ready for an important road trip.  You see my partner and I are from Australia  currently working and travelling through the UK. We had finished our time in Manchester and we in the process of moving our belongings further north.  It was approximately 10am  we stopped at your store to fuel up – both the car and our bellies. After perusing the pre-made sandwich selection  I went for my all time favourite  the egg and watercress. Always a good choice but unfortunately not today.   After eating we hit the road.  Approximately 1 hour later we were driving along the M62 toward Leeds  when all of a sudden it hit me.  Extreme nausea  shivering  sweating  cramps  fever.  Luckily a Welcome Break was just up a few miles. We pulled off the motorway and parked up.   I was so sick with food poisoning  it was debilitating and I was unable to continue our journey.  We booked into a room at the Days Inn Bradford (£60 later) so I could sleep off the illness.

I spent an hour browsing through your TU clothing  for my little girl. Hoping to take advantage of the 25% off  but was disappointed with the low stock. I understand this could be due to the sale being on - never mind  I ll have a look online. I then had to do a food shop. On my way to the checkouts  I veered to the left towards one of the tills - to which a member of staff held her hand up to me  and said  Sorry  he s first   and beckoned the man behind me to the till instead. He had a full trolley (fuller than mine)  and although he was behind me  for some reason  she felt that it was acceptable to let him pay before me. He didn t have any help with loading the shopping onto the checkout  no help packing  didn t appear to be in a rush - so I have no idea why on earth he was allowed to pay and leave before me  even though he was behind me. Anyway  I moved to the next checkout  and seriously considered leaving the damn trolley and walking out. Let me tell you something - I d planned to do the food shopping yesterday  but my dog is poorly and decided to mess on my living room carpet. And my teething daughter was in a horrendous mood yesterday  so I spent the day at home  and part of it was spent in tears. Perhaps I should ve ordered online yesterday  but my daughter wouldn t have given me the time to do so. So  today was the day I had to do the food shopping  because the cupboards are bare! So although I felt wound up and confused  I couldn t leave the shopping there - my daughter would ve been upset if I hadn t bought those Peppa Pig yogurts! I loaded my shopping onto the checkout  and did consider mentioning the situation to the lady about to serve me (Tracey. I didn t see the name of the other lady.) but  I don t like confrontation  and I thought better of involving her. This checkout lady Tracey  threw me a glare when my shopping knocked on of those divider things off the side. Whoops  my bad. She didn t appear to be in a very friendly mood. She didn t ask if I needed help packing (I never accept anyway)  she didn t make conversation  she proceeded to tell me  That s £75  with no please  so didn t tell me that my card had been declined  I found that out for myself. But  hurrah  she did say a very quiet  thank you  before I left. Strange  as she seemed chatty to the couple who she served before me. Perhaps I d done something to piss both these members of staff off. Perhaps it was my face - I even made an effort putting make up on today! Perhaps they didn t like my daughter - maybe they saw her throw a raisin on the floor a little bit earlier on. Or perhaps I wasn t spending enough. Who knows! By this point  I was wound up  and mentally preparing what to write here. And thankfully my daughter has given me the time to write this - thank God for Iggle Piggle! Anyway  I m not writing this because I want a few extra Nectar points (which is what I had when I had a crane fly in my spinach last year). I don t want a £10 Sainsbury s voucher (which is what I had when I had an insect in my grapes a few months ago - which I had to take into store to prove!) I m not after a freebie. I tell you what I would like - an apology. And I suggest that somebody contacts the Bridgend store by the end of today  and recommendeds a bit of restraining - even if it s only to remind the staff to say please and thank you. Or to remind them that it s first come first serve at the checkouts - isn t it?? I can t help but feel all these annoyances lately  are telling me I should be shopping somewhere else.

I spent an hour browsing through your TU clothing  for my little girl. Hoping to take advantage of the 25% off  but was disappointed with the low stock. I understand this could be due to the sale being on - never mind  I ll have a look online. I then had to do a food shop. On my way to the checkouts  I veered to the left towards one of the tills - to which a member of staff held her hand up to me  and said  Sorry  he s first   and beckoned the man behind me to the till instead. He had a full trolley (fuller than mine)  and although he was behind me  for some reason  she felt that it was acceptable to let him pay before me. He didn t have any help with loading the shopping onto the checkout  no help packing  didn t appear to be in a rush - so I have no idea why on earth he was allowed to pay and leave before me  even though he was behind me. Anyway  I moved to the next checkout  and seriously considered leaving the damn trolley and walking out. Let me tell you something - I d planned to do the food shopping yesterday  but my dog is poorly and decided to mess on my living room carpet. And my teething daughter was in a horrendous mood yesterday  so I spent the day at home  and part of it was spent in tears. Perhaps I should ve ordered online yesterday  but my daughter wouldn t have given me the time to do so. So  today was the day I had to do the food shopping  because the cupboards are bare! So although I felt wound up and confused  I couldn t leave the shopping there - my daughter would ve been upset if I hadn t bought those Peppa Pig yogurts! I loaded my shopping onto the checkout  and did consider mentioning the situation to the lady about to serve me (Tracey. I didn t see the name of the other lady.) but  I don t like confrontation  and I thought better of involving her. This checkout lady Tracey  threw me a glare when my shopping knocked on of those divider things off the side. Whoops  my bad. She didn t appear to be in a very friendly mood. She didn t ask if I needed help packing (I never accept anyway)  she didn t make conversation  she proceeded to tell me  That s £75  with no please  so didn t tell me that my card had been declined  I found that out for myself. But  hurrah  she did say a very quiet  thank you  before I left. Strange  as she seemed chatty to the couple who she served before me. Perhaps I d done something to piss both these members of staff off. Perhaps it was my face - I even made an effort putting make up on today! Perhaps they didn t like my daughter - maybe they saw her throw a raisin on the floor a little bit earlier on. Or perhaps I wasn t spending enough. Who knows! By this point  I was wound up  and mentally preparing what to write here. And thankfully my daughter has given me the time to write this - thank God for Iggle Piggle! Anyway  I m not writing this because I want a few extra Nectar points (which is what I had when I had a crane fly in my spinach last year). I don t want a £10 Sainsbury s voucher (which is what I had when I had an insect in my grapes a few months ago - which I had to take into store to prove!) I m not after a freebie. I tell you what I would like - an apology. And I suggest that somebody contacts the Bridgend store by the end of today  and recommendeds a bit of restraining - even if it s only to remind the staff to say please and thank you. Or to remind them that it s first come first serve at the checkouts - isn t it?? I can t help but feel all these annoyances lately  are telling me I should be shopping somewhere else. I would be more than happy to add up how much I spend instore  online  on groceries and clothing  and on petrol  per month! Sometimes I think I should get my wages paid directly to Sainsbury s! If it wasn t the closest supermarket  I wouldn t shop there. I think I ll start venturing a bit further now. I m rather fed up of being pissed off after leaving there.   Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope I haven t pissed you off in the way that Tracey and the other lady have pissed me off - that wasn t my intention.  Sincerely   One fed up mum  who forgot to pick up beef mince.;2016-09-20T12:39:21+0000;10155238525739377_10155239084659377;pageowner;0;Hi Kathryn, I'm very sorry to learn of your experience in store.

Don't really want to use another supermarket as an example but M&S always did good food adverts! And I'm sure in the past your food adverts were good but these ones just looked bland & tasteless!

The Pasta one as a pesto pasta with pine nuts & Parmesan cheese broken on top.  Salad: with pomegranate seeds & halved grapes with feta or goats cheese & cherry toms, olives.  I'm do love your vegetable pizza from the make it up counter section!  The breakfast fry up looked nice. Can't remember what else there was. Just suggestions but those are my tastes 😀;2016-09-20T11:04:28+0000;0

All of our products are grown by growers audited to third party standards. On our organic products you will see the code of the certification body. All of our growers grow using integrated pest management where beneficial insects are used as much as possible, this is where we use certain insects to control others.  The growing conditions of the products will dictate what products our growers need to use to produce their crops and this will vary throughout the year.  Thanks, Daryl.;2016-09-28T17:10:06+0000;0

Now I wasn t too fussed but what s really angered me is when I rang up to see if I could have my shopping I was told I had been refunded but they would ring the store to see if they could redeliver.. I was told the store was too busy and it d be delivered Monday!!!! Now that is a p**s take! I paid for it to be delivered between 6&7 yesterday! I have a newborn baby and a toddler that has been throwing up all day I have nothing in the fridge and I m not able to get out to buy anything! I m now having to wait until Monday because of someone else s incompetence!;2016-09-17T20:48:13+0000;10155229493514377_10155231472824377;pageowner;0;Really sorry about this Ashleigh!

She recently placed an order over £200 and ordered it to come by 10am.  She waited in all morning until 11am before phoning the customer service helpline.   when phoning and explained that she had waited in all morning  she was spoken to rudely and was told her order did not fit on the truck that morning and so her order was therefore cancelled.   As a valued customer of whose orders are made every two weeks and are regularly in excess of £200  this was not deemed acceptable.  When asked why this was cancelled without prior confirmation  she was responded to with an unsincere apology and the call was disconnected.  As a result  my mother was unable to proceed with her lunchtime get together as intended and her friends resorted to having to settle with a pub lunch.  Had i realised that this is the way Sainsburys treat their valued customers  i would not have bothered shopping at your stores myself. You portray Sainsburys to be a great supermarket but you obviously dont have thought for your loyal customers;2016-09-17T20:28:46+0000;10155229457399377_10155231528584377;pageowner;0;I am extremely sorry about this Jen.

I was a bit off a puddle, so I didn't catch any names. The young lady who served me was very polite and offered assistance, but I think she got caught up with customers. So the other member of staff came to help. It was an older fella with grey-ish hair, about 5'ft 1 or 2 (ISH). I just know it was aprox. 10:30am, at the Wetherby Rd station. I heard a squeak as I turned in and thought It wasn't steering properly! But £200 later for both tires, another car part and fitting, and I got to where I needed to be, safely. So thanks for two good people making a stressful situation better by just being pleasant and helpful :) x;2016-09-17T18:54:06+0000;0

Last Tuesday I was treated like dirt in one of your stores and rang head office and complained. Spoke to a Scott Stevenson who said he would send me a £50 gift card as way of apology for the awful way I was treated with my newborn son. It was being sent out first class last Wednesday. By Monday this week it still hadn t arrived. Chased it up with yourselves on here and someone called Amanda sent me a gift card out which did indeed arrive. However bearing in mind I was told it would be active within 72 hours of being sent  and still isn t active I called head office again. Whilst on the phone I noticed on the letter it states it takes 72 hours from when I recieve it not from when it s sent out to me to become active (I m slightly puzzled as to how sainsburys think they know at what time my post arrives?!) but anyway the bloke at head office came back to me and has just told me the card will never actually activate unless I register it myself online....now this is 3 different things I ve been told by sainsburys    1. Active within 72 hours of being sent out  2. Active within 72 hours of me recieveing it   3. It will never be active unless I register it and then it will take 72 hours after registering it for it to become active.

Other than the original one that was meant to be there by last Friday?   I've raised issue with the fact i have been told... 1.goft card will be active upon me recieveing it. 2. Gift card will be active within 72 hours of recieveing it 3.gift card will be active 72 hours after I receive it  The. Head office tell me  4.it will never be active unless I register it online and take out a nectar card which I didn't have and didn't want 5. I receive a inbox off sainsburys today tellin me it will be active on Monday 6. Head office are saying it will be Tuesday or Wednesday  Just how many different things relating to one activation of one gift card so sainsburys want to tell me? And why do I keep getting ignored when I ask DO YOU MAKE IT ALL UP AS YOU GO ALONG? As surely this many different things by one store isn't normal ? It sure is appalling customer service at minimum! Then to have you ignore all this and tell me you have sent the gift card out (which you have after I chased it up after the one that was alledgedly sent on Wednesday 7th September to be with me and be able to be used by Friday 9th September never arrived - Scott Stevenson at head office was sending that one personally apparently!) when I have never asked if the gift card has been sent as its sat on my coffee table with no value on it and me having now been told a grand total of 6 different things about when it will be active just completely takes the biscuit.!  No wonder with customer service as appalling as this, ignoring customers enquiries and everyone seemingly making stuff up as they go along and telling me something different, no wonder you are losing customers left right and centre!;2016-09-17T13:51:11+0000;0

You can read their full terms and conditions here http://bit.ly/2ceYKIw. If you forget your Nectar card you can always keep hold of your receipt and take this to the customer service desk at a later visit. A colleague will be able to add the points manually. Hope this helps, Sam.;2016-09-16T16:18:05+0000;0

My 23 month old daughter had a horrendous accident whilst in store this morning and within seconds there where numerous members of staff who helped me and my daughter immensely both in calming her down and then in sorting out a staff member to take us the hospital in her own car. My daughter was sick all over the ladies car on route (and it wasn t just a bit) After I d checked her in at the hospital and we were waiting to be seen  a lady from the store arrived with a carrier bag filled with a change of clothes for both of us! Nappies and wipes incase I needed them whilst we waited and also a cuddly toy for my daughter to comfort her. I actually welled up at this point with both a mixture of such absolute gratitude and utter distress. I can t thank those staff members enough for helping keep us calm and also for the aftercare I felt I received. I only wish I had taken note of all there names as when I returned to store - some 6 and a half hours later nobody on customer services knew anything about it and so couldn t help with who it may have been and so I couldn t thank them personally. Obviously I will try and return to store tomorrow to thank the staff but I felt in the meantime if someone could please let the store know that they have some real diamonds working there and I m eternally grateful xx;2016-09-15T16:58:23+0000;10155222301539377_10155222396119377;pageowner;0;Hi there Hayley, thanks for getting in touch.

My daughter was very animated-ly rowing the boat and singing whilst we had a look around and she rowed slightly to much and fell out the trolley head first. I honestly couldn't fault Sainsburys it was the fact I don't have eyes in the back of my head or 3 pairs of hands! I thought only having the baby would be easier than all 3 of my children that I usually have but boy was she out to prove me wrong haha xx;2016-09-15T18:40:54+0000;0

I was at a self service checkout when a lady approached with a very animated man whose arm she had hold of and who was waving around a china cup.  She explained that she was a support worker and the gentleman she was with had autism and learning difficulties and had a thing about cups.  He had taken one from the shelf which cost £3 but he only had £2 and was becoming very anxious at not being able to go through the checkout with the cup he had chosen.  The support worker advised she had asked to speak to a manager but was letting them know she was  going through the process  of the checkout to calm the gentleman down.  I reached across and gave her a £1 coin so the gentleman could buy the cup he wanted  she thanked me and they went on their way.  One of your assistants at the self service came over and told me it was a nice thing to do.  I said if that was my Dad or Brother or Son  I d want someone to step in and just make his day a bit easier - and it was only a pound.  Another assistant came over smiling and agreed with the first assistant and then the first one went over to customer services.  She came back just as I was paying and getting ready to leave.   The care worker gave me a card to give to you   she said and then handed me a pound.   This is from Sainsbury s.  We are going to put his cup through our till and pay the pound.   The card read   Freeways.  Hello.  Sorry I couldn t stop and talk.  I am a support worker.  I am supporting an adult with autism and learning difficulties.  If you have any questions or comments please call us on (and left a number).

I was at a self service checkout when a lady approached with a very animated man whose arm she had hold of and who was waving around a china cup.  She explained that she was a support worker and the gentleman she was with had autism and learning difficulties and had a thing about cups.  He had taken one from the shelf which cost £3 but he only had £2 and was becoming very anxious at not being able to go through the checkout with the cup he had chosen.  The support worker advised she had asked to speak to a manager but was letting them know she was  going through the process  of the checkout to calm the gentleman down.  I reached across and gave her a £1 coin so the gentleman could buy the cup he wanted  she thanked me and they went on their way.  One of your assistants at the self service came over and told me it was a nice thing to do.  I said if that was my Dad or Brother or Son  I d want someone to step in and just make his day a bit easier - and it was only a pound.  Another assistant came over smiling and agreed with the first assistant and then the first one went over to customer services.  She came back just as I was paying and getting ready to leave.   The care worker gave me a card to give to you   she said and then handed me a pound.   This is from Sainsbury s.  We are going to put his cup through our till and pay the pound.

She explained that she was a support worker and the gentleman she was with had autism and learning difficulties and had a thing about cups.

It seems to be everytime I purchase it... it's almost like the store knows I am coming.   Can I just ask though is there any chance the recipe can be revised? It's just I have tried a lot of brands and usually only get the freedom range bread if i am desperate as it really doesn't tickle my tastebuds, more makes them so dry feel like a dehydrated mess at the end of eating it and if you toast it you might as well just hope for bread crumbs.   Thanks again for your help I really appreciate it!  Amy;2016-09-15T17:55:34+0000;0

I being very anxious in general was in a fluster  particularly because i hadn t left the checkout and another customer seeing i was having issues decided to move me along so she could make her purchases.  Immediately after the bag split I was rescued by the most wonderful lady! Christine was an absolute diamond! She helped me collect my things and fetched me a bag  taking me to an empty self service checkout to pay for the bag.  I told her I will give feedback as she was ever so helpful and even though i have worked in retail for 15 years  I find that level of service is rare these days.  She told me she absolutely loves what she does for a living and you can tell! She is a credit to your store and the company! I only hope all staff are trained to be as helpful and wonderful as Christine as she absolutely made my day  had it not been for her I would have most likely panicked and had a much more distressful experience.;2016-09-15T10:46:22+0000;10155221404884377_10155221950914377;pageowner;0;Hi Emma.

The fuel market is extremely competitive and prices are very volatile in the current climate. Prices differ throughout the UK and you will see varying prices even between outlets owned by the same company.   We want to ensure our petrol stations remain competitive within their local area, offering customers a fair price wherever they live. We therefore adjust the price at each station using locally gathered pricing information.   We also run regular promotions on fuel including bonus Nectar points and money off per litre when spending a qualifying amount in our stores. Hope this helps, Sam.;2016-09-15T14:05:39+0000;0

I was hoping there would be something in the new On The Go range but no.. A tiny pack of veggie sushi  that s all. Both Tesco and Co-Op do a vegan wrap and have vegan cheeses. Sainsburys need to catch up! Love the clear labelling on all by Sainsburys product though!;2016-09-14T19:41:53+0000;10155219057309377_10155221431249377;pageowner;0;Hey Maya, really sorry about this. We're investing in improving the range and quality of our On the Go products so it's disappointing this hasn't been reflected in your recent visit. Could you confirm which store you normally visit?

The problem I have had on this and my previous visit is that I have parked in a child space but there is not a trolley bay on that row. I have  however  learned that at any supermarket the trolley collectors are very efficient at removing the child trolleys from the bay s near the child spaces (where they are needed) and putting them at the front of the store. So I carried roughly a stone in weight (not easy with carpel tunnel left over from pregnancy) to the front of the store  there were only the two usual types of trolley  So I trudged through to the other side near all of the disabled spaces but only to find wheelchair trolleys ( you have that right  at least) and child trolleys with plastic seats. I therefore had to put my daughter s car seat in a regular  high trolley and squash my shopping around it. I didn t need too much today so that was achievable if a little tricky. Here s the thing  there are lots of things as a new mum that can be a bit overwhelming and your first few trips to the supermarket alone with your baby is one of them. Now I could have done my shopping online (not without its inconveniences as the doorbell rings mid-breastfeed or just as you ve got baby to sleep) but us mums need to pop out of the house at least once a day for the sake of our sanity and sometimes for extra nappies or forgotten items and let s face it sometimes us breastfeeding mums just need some chocolate and our formula feeding friends the odd bottle of wine to ease us through the sleep deprivation. So come on sainsburys  make it a little easier on us and put the baby trolleys near the parent parking.

I ordered a ps4 and games package for delivery today   which was supposed to be a gift for someone. Stock was checked before ordering as I wasn t allowed to place the order until the website had checked our area. I have just had the delivery driver here telling me I m very sorry the ps4 is out of stock but we have charged and sent you two games that were with offer. Now a bit of common sense would have said what use are the games without a console and is the customer actually daft enough to pay full price for said games that were included in a ps4 bundle. So I now have to wait up to 5 days for a refund of said games when it took Sainsbury s 24hrs to take it. Oh and the email supposedly sent informing me of it bring out of stock doesn t even exist    as if it did I would have made sure to let you know before delivery that games were of no use without a console.  You even have my mobile no as you used it yesterday to text me details of delivery and no message via that either regarding stock level.Really not impressed!!;2016-09-13T19:35:44+0000;10155215895444377_10155217706694377;pageowner;0;Sorry you're unhappy Nicky, all deals are subject to availability.

I decided to buy my son a playstation 4 for his upcoming birthday and I ordered it from your online click and collect service.  I went through the process of registering my details as a new customer and even managed to get myself a cheeky  new customer  discount code. Ordered the ps4 and three games which were in a deal and proceeded to checkout. I received a confirmation email and had booked a slot to collect between 8 and 9 this morning.  Off I trundle at 7:40 am this morning from bridgwater  which is approx 11 miles away  got to hankridge store by around 8 am and then sat and waited. Waited until 8:20 am when I decided I needed to go and see someone instore as there was clearly no one to serve me. I went into the store and straight to your customer service desk where I was greeted by a chap who I think was called Nico. This chap who I believe to be called Nico listened to my story and then began to make some phone calls.  When Nico got off the phone he realised my worst fears  there was no ps4 to collect as they were out of stock. Now as I m not completely deluded I do realise that stock runs out! What I am miffed about are as follows: • How can people be allowed to order things online the day before that aren t in stock? • Considering sainsburys had 2 forms of contact (email and mobile number) why didn t anyone feel the need to let me know? • and probably most importantly my sons not getting his ps4. I was given a £10 gift card by Nico from customer services who to be fair did everything by the book  but at the end of the day I was promised something that wasn t delivered and was told by Nico that he didn t know when anymore ps4 s would be delivered to store and even when some were delivered I would need to re order again via the website for click and collect.

I decided to buy my son a playstation 4 for his upcoming birthday and I ordered it from your online click and collect service.  I went through the process of registering my details as a new customer and even managed to get myself a cheeky  new customer  discount code. Ordered the ps4 and three games which were in a deal and proceeded to checkout. I received a confirmation email and had booked a slot to collect between 8 and 9 this morning.  Off I trundle at 7:40 am this morning from bridgwater  which is approx 11 miles away  got to hankridge store by around 8 am and then sat and waited. Waited until 8:20 am when I decided I needed to go and see someone instore as there was clearly no one to serve me. I went into the store and straight to your customer service desk where I was greeted by a chap who I think was called Nico. This chap who I believe to be called Nico listened to my story and then began to make some phone calls.  When Nico got off the phone he realised my worst fears  there was no ps4 to collect as they were out of stock. Now as I m not completely deluded I do realise that stock runs out! What I am miffed about are as follows: • How can people be allowed to order things online the day before that aren t in stock? • Considering sainsburys had 2 forms of contact (email and mobile number) why didn t anyone feel the need to let me know? • and probably most importantly my sons not getting his ps4. I was given a £10 gift card by Nico from customer services who to be fair did everything by the book  but at the end of the day I was promised something that wasn t delivered and was told by Nico that he didn t know when anymore ps4 s would be delivered to store and even when some were delivered I would need to re order again via the website for click and collect. What s to stop the same thing happening again?? Come on sainsburys  sort this out!

Ordered the ps4 and three games which were in a deal and proceeded to checkout. I received a confirmation email and had booked a slot to collect between 8 and 9 this morning.  Off I trundle at 7:40 am this morning from bridgwater  which is approx 11 miles away  got to hankridge store by around 8 am and then sat and waited. Waited until 8:20 am when I decided I needed to go and see someone instore as there was clearly no one to serve me. I went into the store and straight to your customer service desk where I was greeted by a chap who I think was called Nico. This chap who I believe to be called Nico listened to my story and then began to make some phone calls.  When Nico got off the phone he realised my worst fears  there was no ps4 to collect as they were out of stock. Now as I m not completely deluded I do realise that stock runs out! What I am miffed about are as follows: • How can people be allowed to order things online the day before that aren t in stock? • Considering sainsburys had 2 forms of contact (email and mobile number) why didn t anyone feel the need to let me know? • and probably most importantly my sons not getting his ps4. I was given a £10 gift card by Nico from customer services who to be fair did everything by the book  but at the end of the day I was promised something that wasn t delivered and was told by Nico that he didn t know when anymore ps4 s would be delivered to store and even when some were delivered I would need to re order again via the website for click and collect. What s to stop the same thing happening again?? Come on sainsburys  sort this out!

We perform regular checks with our suppliers to ensure these standards are being met and that a good safety record is maintained.  Unfortunately, without having the opportunity to examine a sample of the food you ate, we cannot say whether this product was at fault. Symptoms of food poisoning can take up to ten days to develop and can be caused by anything you've eaten during that time.  We're also aware that some people can be sensitive to certain ingredients and that, on occasion, reactions can be immediate.  I'd like to reassure you that we take all customer feedback seriously.  I can fully appreciate how unpleasant this experience must've been for you and have passed your concerns on to our suppliers   We'll continue to work closely with them to ensure tight quality control systems are being upheld.

The best way to maintain a constant temperature is to store them in the fridge (in their original packaging is best, to avoid the possibility of them becoming tainted by other items in the fridge). Mainly, the reason this is good for the eggs is that it helps avoid temperature fluctuations and temperatures that are above 20 degrees. I hope this clears things up. Ryan.;2016-09-13T09:52:36+0000;1

Thought id pop in and get my lunch  in there ten minutes  no fruit in the little shop area  asked a member of staff who pointed to the fruit aisle  the staff member on the fruit aisle tooled me to the chilled aisle  I then ended up back at customer service  then back at the shop with by that point four members of staff. I was then told sorry we don t have any can t help!  So no healthy choice for meal deal  by then my  pop  in taken up a stupid amount of time.  I was not even offered an alternative....will be avoiding this shop at all costs in the future....how many sainsburys team members does it take to find a bag of fruit??;2016-09-13T07:47:24+0000;10155214216069377_10155214679069377;pageowner;0;Hi Keri, I'm so about this. That's not the customer service we strive for at Sainsury's. Did you happen to get any of the colleagues names? I'll look into this for you. Sonny;2016-09-13T11:00:12+0000;0

Email at midnight saying a PS4 deal has been very popular  no stock left and that s why they won t be delivering it this morning. Trish from the Therford branch rang at 7am this morning to explain it was a glitch and they still had stock if I wanted to re-order (at full price). Quick call to my local Norwich branch and they have stock too! Someone is telling porkies! Safe to say I ll steer well clear for any future purchases. Annoying how they fulfil some orders  but not others.;2016-09-13T07:13:38+0000;10155214163194377_10155214271894377;pageowner;0;I'm very sorry Michael, there was a glitch in pricing however the original deal is still available.

It was the first time we have ever used sainsburys nappies and we wont be using them again. I never mentioned compensation, I said i still wasnt happy. What I want is for sainsburys to reconsider the manufacturing of their own brand nappy - to bring them up to speed with other suppliers. If they are happy providing a product that is not fit for purpose, fair enough, but as I say, I expect better.;2016-09-13T08:18:01+0000;2

I am regular customer at your Tadcaster branch and after the devastating floods that the town suffered and the fact your store is cut off from one half on the town I have made a point of continuing to support it with my custom. However today I was a bit annoyed at the customer service. The store has one those machines in it that you put £1 in and kids get a toy in a plastic ball. These machines are rather attractive to my 4 year old Son. He asked if he could have a toy from one but I did not have any change so I asked at the Kiosk to change a £5 note for £1 coins. I was refused as it is  against the rules to give change  This upset my 4 year old obviously he did not understand why  even though he burst into tears in the shop there was still no exception made. I appreciate that there are rules etc... however I do not believe exceptions cannot be made. I suggest that you should not have machines that entice and attract small children if you cannot provide the common courtesy to give change out for them  I believe that is a fair point.;2016-09-12T18:08:11+0000;10155212411904377_10155212736674377;pageowner;0;Hi Joanna!

I bought 3x Free From Gingerbread men for my daughter on 8/9/16. When I got home all 3 had best before dates of 10/08/16! I called and advised these should be taken off the shelf and that I wanted a refund. Returning on the 9/9/16 the entire box of 7 gingerbread men all having expired were still sat on the shelf. I personally handed these to a manager and expressed my dissatisfaction. Low and behold we returned today the 12/09/16 and what did we find an entire box of gingerbread men having all expired on the 10/08/16 back on the shelf.

I approached the desk with my husband  carrying a basket of items and instead of being greeted I got snapped at by your colleague that if I had more than 5 items I would have to go to another  till. I had chosed this till as I wanted a scratchcard as well. So we counted our items and thankfully we had exactly 5 so with no form of warm reception we were beckoned to move forward. The colleague then continued to complain that her till wasn t suited for the larger items ( I was purchasing a large bag of rabbit food) and was reluctantly scanning through my goods. When I handed her the bag of rabbit food she took it in one hand and then let it drop in front of me saying I would have to lift it on the scanner myself as she couldn t do it as once again her till wasn t the right size for this item. We weren t offered a bag and the general feel of the transaction was that we were stopping her from doing nothing  which was something she was doing very well when we approached her. She also told us to get a new nectar card as our one didn t scan properly. Overall very  very poor service and an incredibly rude assistant. Will use self service from now on and leave my impulse and add ons to other stores who actually want to serve me.;2016-09-12T16:51:38+0000;10155212111324377_10155212347984377;pageowner;0;Hi there, I'm really sorry about this.

I noticed the total was just over £25 I said oh I thought the phone was £45. The lady serving me completely  ingored me. I asked to look at the phone she d scanned and noticed it was not the phone I d asked for. Her reply was we don t have it in stock. She was about to put the payment  though as I asked if it was the phone I ordered. Without informing me it wasn t the phone I had requested. This fact did not matter to her. When I asked if the next phone up the £75 one was in stock I was very rudely told no this is it. When I said I didn t want this phone she was rude and then cancelled it. Now if I hadn t noticed she would have sold us completely  the wrong phone without informing us. I ve never met such a rude member of staff.;2016-09-11T18:53:36+0000;10155208929504377_10155210808274377;pageowner;0;That's really disappointing, sorry about this Jemma.

I can't be bothered, previous problems have been met with a ""here's a £10 gift card as compensation "" so sorry Sainsburys I don't believe in your empty promises to investigate what happened and make sure it never happens again, your system is seriously flawed and you are more interested in profit margins than your loyal customers.

My family and I ride our horses around these areas and every time bar none we meet one of your delivery vans they pass wide and slide and stop and turn off engine if needed. Always with a smile too. Please can you pass this in to whichever branch and department that covers our area.

Power outage in the area at 10:10 meant store operating on generator only. All fridges were curtained off however a colleague was stationed at every aisle directing customers to the correct shelf for their purchase meaning very little disruption to their shopping. When power finally re-established at about 11:00  the tills took a short while to re-boot but again staff on hand to open up extra tills and get the customers on their way. Store Manager  Sonja very visible  directing her staff and making sure all the customers knew what was happening. Great customer experience in a difficult time - well done;2016-09-11T13:10:24+0000;10155207868934377_10155208306579377;pageowner;0;Thanks Elaine! I've fed your comments back to the store.

I went over to the cigarette counter to purchase a cold drink  as I was lying the lady my daughter fell out of the trolley and banged her head and shoulder.  As you can imagine she was hysterical crying  i was really upset  and the lady behind the counter just looked at us and walked away. We where left there on our own with no offer of assistance  or first aid. Am I wrong in thinking assistance should have been offered  especially considering it was a young child. I have contacted sainsburys several times now with no response.

As you can imagine he was left very upset and distraught. It wasn t very nice for myself as a parent to experience either! What concerns me is that NOT ONE member of staff showed any concern or approached myself or my son to see if he was ok after we managed to get the travelator stopped and his lace free??

Why  I wondered.... well  I was already in credit  then they carried over the credit from the Gas bill (without making it clear that had been done) but THEN  they debited my bank for a further £288! Why?  I was already in credit.... I had already switched supplier.  The lady in the complaints office was very pleasant but this is outrageous. The amount they debited appeared totally random... watch this space....;2016-09-10T14:11:26+0000;10155204632964377_10155219740179377;bd21579c71b344d111e51dabce54e424e11f8a44;0;did you know companies like this exist?  https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/;2016-09-14T23:32:05+0000;0

(From Fareham Broadcut) Every delivery that he gets assigned to for us  he is just brilliant with my little girl. She s only 2 but loves it when the online shopping turns up. He separates out all the light bags (and if there s no light bags he just takes things out of bags to give her) so she can help take it to the kitchen. He tells her what the fruit and veg are called and praises her for helping mummy. He is fantastic at his job and makes our shopping deliveries lots of fun. Thank you!

I lost my card on the 7th but didn't realise until 8th when immediately phoned the store and was told that in fact the card was still there and I would be able to receive it upon presenting my proof of identity. Since the store was already closing for the evening I had to wait until the next day (9th). However, when I arrived at the store, one of your employees told me she had already destroyed the card because nobody had informed her and there was no notice in the staff book. It was purely a matter of lack of communication between the staff. I understand your policy and I do take into account it was me losing the card. I just wasn't happy with the fact I phoned and was told to pick it up just to then come out with nothing, which did affect my personal plans.;2016-09-10T10:01:22+0000;0

I used to work for Waitrose in the office and we certainly would not have allowed this to happen to anyone we would have either for them a taxi which we would have paid for or one of our partners would have taking them home.

By the time I got to the checkout my 6 week old was having a meltdown and I had to pick her up to comfort her. Your staff were fantastic  packing for me and getting extra help. A far cry from a large chain that practically throw your groceries at you to scan as quickly as possible! People are quick to moan about bad customer service so I thought it right to praise excellent service.

I understand how difficult it is shopping with a little one, so a helping hand is always appreciated! Do you remember the name of the colleague who served you? If so drop us a PM with their name, or alternatively send us a snap of your full receipt. We'll make sure all those involved are made aware of the praise. Thanks, Kirsty;2016-09-09T18:00:45+0000;0

I thought the bakers started early to have the products ready in the morning. My husband went back at 11 and was told none left. Ridiculous. He then had to cycle to portswood store  where they had many loaves available. Really getting frustrated with the Shirley store  we have this problem many times.

Our product technologist has advised us that all standard teabag paper is bleached, however, we can guarantee that it's chlorine free. This is verified by the Soil Association who request evidence of this in order for the teabags to be certified as organic.  With regards to Epichlorohydrin, this ingredient is used within processing by all 3 worldwide standard teabag paper manufacturers. It is permitted to a level of 4% (by dry weight paper) under European laws as a resin to prevent the teabags from bursting when in water. When independently tested, this is not detectable in the water which means that the level is less than 2 parts per billion.   I hope this answers your questions. Susanna;2016-09-13T10:53:35+0000;0

Doves Farm Gluten Free Self Raising Flour 1KG and Doves Farm Gluten Free Plain Flour 1KG,   Nature's Path Gluten Free Mesa Sunrise 355g, Nature's Path Gluten Free Maple Sunrise 332g, Kelkin Gluten Free Jaffa Cakes 150g,  Warburtons Gluten Free Brown Seed Rolls 4pk, Genius Gluten Free Spicy Fruit Loaf 400g  (actually there was no gluten bread at all).      Those are the things I remember wanting to buy but couldn't.  I'm sure you can appreciate that when you can only eat certain products that people rely on being able to eat the few available.  The shelves are often empty which is why I commented and I frequently exchange comments and suggestions with fellow Gluten free shoppers who are similarly stuck... often it is the most crowded part of the supermarket!   It would be great if you could let me know what happens, I'm happy to report back in future or give ideas for potential product lines :-)  I am really enjoying the schools frozen sausage rolls and also the new dairy free ice-cream desserts.  I could eat them all day! - Many thanks,  Stephen;2016-09-11T17:43:33+0000;0

It was about 12.15pm. I did ask someone about the flour and they said it wasn't sold anymore :-( I asked about other gluten free food but she just said ""I guess you've already been to the aisle"".  It's hard being gluten free for medical reasons and though I'm used to being inventive and purchasing on the spur of the moment, it's a bit difficult when simple things like flour, bread rolls or cereals are sold out. It's happened a few times recently, it would be great if you could help!;2016-09-09T14:09:35+0000;0

Over a year ago my young daughter got stuck in one of the toilet cubicles due to the flimsy lock being in need of repair  the part on the outside where a screwdriver would normally open the lock was completely sheared off due to this having to be done many times before. The staff did say it happened a lot and agreed the locks needed repair. The staff on the day were very helpful and got a ladder to rescue my daughter  and gave her a slush puppy to apologise. I asked the customer service desk at the time to pass on to management my positive experience of how it was handled. Since then I ve noticed all the locks are now in the same state of disrepair and I mentioned it at customer services months ago.  Now that the  refurbishment  is now completed it s disappointing to see nothing has been done to bring the toilets into a reasonable condition. We visited today and the locks are still awful  and as is often the case one cubicle is out of order. Also whilst it s no longer an issue for me personally  the baby changing rooms are almost impossible to negotiate a pushchair into with the awkward door and wall positioning/tight turn inside. Of all the areas that needed addressing instore it was these - the rest of the store was actually fine as it was!;2016-09-08T20:17:55+0000;10155198736234377_10155200493229377;pageowner;0;Hi Lydnsey, I'm very sorry.

Meaty  tasty and definitely something you could eat on its own or as part of another dish. Come on Sainsbury s some of your food is better than Waitrose  - don t let this be another one on the avoid list. Seafood should not be this bland  I ve caught and cooked both shrimp and prawn  they do not have a glassy texture. What on earth are your suppliers doing to them?;2016-09-08T15:10:11+0000;10155197716154377_10155198236289377;pageowner;0;Hey Paul, I'm awfully sorry. Could you send over the barcode please?

We want to offer our customers the best quality products throughout the year. We're a non-political organisation and source our own brand products according to the ability of the producer to meet our quality, safety and ethical standards. We give our customers the opportunity to make their own decisions by labelling our own brand products clearly and accurately.   We're founding members of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI). The Code covers nine key principles, including safe and hygienic working conditions, and payment of a fair wage.  We undertake regular audits and due diligence with our own brand suppliers to ensure our high standards and the integrity of our products are being upheld at all times. We require our suppliers to comply with the Ethical Trade Industry’s Base Code for ethical sourcing and any evidence of malpractice is investigated.   In summary, we continue to be committed to ethical, responsible sourcing and hope you feel reassured by our intentions to provide our customers with honest and open information about the food they buy. Thanks for taking the time to write to us and express your concerns. Sam.;2016-09-08T17:22:56+0000;1

Zoe  from the Westhoughton branch  is absolutely amazing. She s fantastic with my children  especially my autistic son  Oliver. She s always ready with a smile  talks to him with enthusiasm even when he won t respond (and he usually doesn t)  and is patient and understanding with us both  when I m struggling to bag my items while he s kicking off his shoes or trying to crawl out of his buggy. She s happy to give my four-year-old daughter a dozen high fives (she s obsessed with high fives right now)  and listens intently to her rapid-fire talk about whatever show or toy she s in to in the moment.  Zoe is the epitome of Excellent Customer Service. As the mother of an autistic child  I find shopping painful at times  overwhelmed with fear that people are judging me and my child  and stressed from trying to get through the experience without forgetting something or losing one of his shoes  socks or dummies. Whenever I see Zoe on the tills  I make a beeline for her  because I know I don t have to worry about any of that with her.   She definitely deserves to be recognised for her outstanding service. A big THANK YOU to Zoe from me and Ollie. <3;2016-09-08T12:44:51+0000;10155197316184377_10155197950064377;pageowner;0;Hi Tracey, thank you so much for taking the time to send this lovely message to us!

I've checked both search terms on our website and both show correct results for the terms you've search for. If you continued onto the second page of each, you would have been able to see more relevant products - this happens because our search function uses keywords, and recommends items that you could use in lieu of another (for example, searching beef stew and dumplings will show raw beef, as this would be used to make beef stew). The reason you've seen childrens meals when searching ""chilled food"" is because they are chilled meals. We have a section dedicated to chilled food which is available by clicking 'Chilled' on the menu bar. Also, if your order is under £40, it will be subject to our standard £7 delivery charge which is outlined in the terms and conditions. I hope this helps! Ryan.;2016-09-07T18:12:45+0000;0

I'll see what I can find out for you. Can you advise me which meals, aside from the fish pie, that you're unable to microwave now? I'll be able to contact our buyer to find out more about the changes. Also, if you can send me a PM with your e-mail address and your local store, I'll put in a product request for the chow mein and noodles - while I can't make any promises that we can definitely stock it again, I'll definitely make our suppliers aware of the demand!

Trinity street. Thankyou for replying but it seems to be sorted out now, my mother had misplaced a bag of curtains, tried both phoning & messaging the store. Ringing several times today (55 Min & 4 phone calls later, ringing the whole time) still no answer, she decided to just go back into the shop. Another 30 min bus journey & what a joy it was. Shop supervisor had been been given it by till worker Jean was her name, ( sorry didn't get her last name.)

I need to let you know that the £2 bubbles solution you sell advertised as  touchable bubbles  created havoc for my girls and their friends  hair.  When the bubbles burst  inevitably around the girls  heads  the bubbles reduce to a glue-like substance.

I came into the store at about 8 this morning and was in a right flap! I am not a confident driver by any means and I had to drive to Folkestone from Gillingham for work. After driving round the town getting more and more flustered I saw your store and parked. I was stressed out and  quite frankly  being an idiot and shaking. I spoke to the lady at customer services and she was amazing. She calmed me down and explained the parking charges and told me not to worry about anything. She told me to move my car in my lunch break and as long as I bought something in store the parking would be free.  I came back in my lunch break  bought lunch and she validated my parking whilst checking if I was ok. She was genuinely lovely and helpful. I returned at the end of my shift and saw her again as she was leaving and again she checked how I was and offered her help. She really helped put me at ease today  going above and beyond what was expected of her to do the best for me. She is an asset to your company and deserves a HUGE well done! Thank you Debs. You re a superstar! X;2016-09-05T19:10:01+0000;10155187805819377_10155188222409377;pageowner;0;This is brilliant, I'm so glad Debs was able to help Kelly!

Peaches do vary in colour and texture, and if you prefer the yellow-fleshed sort, a good tip is to check the front of the packaging. In this case it says 'white flesh', but other varieties are marked as yellow. There's no excuse for them to be hard or tasteless however, so I've made a log of your concerns to be passed on to our buying team, and I've popped 800 points (£4) onto your balance so you can get something nice on us. They'll appear within 72 hours! Susanna;2016-09-06T08:51:07+0000;1

I assure you there is more than enough money to go around, it's just unevenly shared.  There are people who have so much money they couldn't spend it in a lifetime and it's mostly come us.   The refugees cannot sort themselves out, that's idiotic to say.   They're helpless because of what we're doing to them - and we're doing it under a false pretext.  Therre were no WMDs in Iraq, Gadaffi was NOT a dictator and Assad WAS democratically elected.  The reason for wars is so people can get rich - it's a cash cow and no mistake - people make a FORTUNE.  And it's all at the expense of the fodder who join the army and who are then turfed out and become homeless (many have gone into the army after being in the care system and cannot cope alone).  As to the refugees - they asked for none of it, they're innocent victims.;2016-09-06T16:13:28+0000;0

You're right what you said about India - that is only a drop in the ocean - there's loads of money available it's just not trickling down how it should - it's all with the bankers.  You're listening to too much propaganda, WE are arming, training, supporting ISIS!!!!   ISIS comprises paid mercenaries from 90 countries who will fight for whoever pays them the most money.  Do you really think true Muslims would bomb Mosques - Muslims are extremely religious - they wouldn't do that.   Al Quaeda is also a western construct (ditto the Taliban in Afghanistan).   Can you remember one of the reasons we went into Afghanistan?   Because of the opium fields.  Well do you know what - the heroin from Afghanistan now takes up 95% of the world trade in the product.   You don't need to be a genius to know that the fields only need burning - the CIA are raking in funds and heroin addiction in the USA has increased 150%.  I assure you, Assad is NOT a dictator - Syria was the 6th safest country for tourism before we stuck our noses in.  |Other reasons we went in to Syria was gas and oil   But another reason was cos he was anti ISrael.  Gadaffi was also anti Gadaffi.   ISrael is the cancer of the middle east.  Don't listen to the BBC - they actually staged the sarin gas attack.  Assad did NOT use the gas.   Hillary Clinton sent the gas to the ""moderate rebels"" (who are also terrorists). IT'S ALL PROPAGANDA - we've been fed on it since school;2016-09-06T16:30:25+0000;0

You've massively reduced the selection of sandwiches I can get as part of a meal deal for £3. It genuinely feels as though there are no advantages for the consumer here. I used to be able to get a wrap, a drink and a snack for £3 and to get the exact same bundle will now cost me £4.20. As someone who visits Sainsburys every lunch time, 5 days a week, this is quite the price hike.   Greater overall choice at a considerably higher price.;2016-09-05T14:07:45+0000;0

We have arrangements at store level to donate unsold food to local charities and any food which we can't sell for health and safety reasons will be sent for anaerobic digestion. Doing this allows us to turn unsuitable food into green energy which in turn completely powers one of our stores. Our bakery goods are unfortunately unsuitable for donation to local charities due to their short shelf life compared to packaged products and thus have to be sent off for digestion. Usually the store will do this at the end of the day, which on a Sunday for most of our stores in England is between 3 and 4pm due to Sunday Trading laws. Did you speak to a member of the store team about this when you were in-store? If you'd like to read more about this and how we're continuing to send zero operational waste to landfill you can do so here: http://bit.ly/1A2wsE0 - I hope this helps!

I said that it was the third time that they were clearing the shelves before closing.  Why can't staff clear excess produce after closing? Sainsburys is losing sales. I assume though that you save more on less hours for your staff than you lose on sales. I think your bakery teams need to be producing a more accurate anount of breads that are actually sold weekly as well. Then there would be less to be thrown away. Anaerobic digestion is good but there is less eco impact if the excess is never produced in the first place.;2016-09-04T21:54:07+0000;0

You are are annoying customers who see stuff they they would have liked being binned , well before closing time. Sainsbury's do so many good things, from making stores more energy efficient, free range eggs, more organic lines etc, then they undo all the good work in other ways. (Battery chicken in all prepared chicken dishes for example.. cutting themselves off from all ethical customers) .  It annoys me to see a big poster on the wall congratulating yourselves on selling free range eggs, when virtually none of your chicken products are free range. Most of your prepared meals that have lamb in them seem to all have lamb from the other side of the world instead of locally produced, to save a few pence presumably. Utter madness.;2016-09-05T00:36:52+0000;1

I can now tell when I walk in that store every new colleague from the originally staff as the levels of customer service provided by the original staff are always brilliant and I ve never had a complaint about them always willing to go that extra mile.

I stopped going in because of the quality of the food and the empty shelves. I really wanted to make a beef madras today so called in with being so close to get the ingredients..no such luck. Even when it came to getting the Braising steak...none there. We gave up and went to get some long life milk...none there!! So many empty shelves. I will stick to Tesco s.;2016-09-03T16:30:19+0000;10155179681344377_10155180295109377;9a2d6c57f395d52eb8200eec416efd45470f7dd4;0;..but what supermarket does not have Braising steak or long life milk? Oh yes...Sainsbury's haha The shelves were empty. One of two reasons I stopped going in the first place. You would expect to go to a big superstore and buy every day things with no problem xx;2016-09-03T19:16:37+0000;0

I was approached by a staff member who was down syndrome i didn t catch his name but he was being friendly and making small talk we ended up talking about old children s TV shows we used to watch and he was very charming!!! suddenly a lady from customer service came to him and abruptly told him to move away and that he had baskets to sort out...I was shocked to say the least equal opportunities means exactly that and that young man made my stressful shopping trip just a little bit bearable maybe certain staff members should be trained in basic manners as well as customer service.;2016-09-03T03:52:09+0000;10155177906669377_10155178807769377;pageowner;0;Very sorry about this Becky, can you PM us a description of the colleague please?
