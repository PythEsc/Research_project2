I bought a top from one of your stores in the 19th September.  unfortunately it doesn t quite sit right and i don t have the receipt (forgot to pick it up from the self service machine). anyway - I thought I d be ok to get a gift card/credit note as I m always buying clothes from you so know it would get used pretty much straight away. I was advised by the staff member on customer services that as I had no receipt they would have to deduct 25% manually as you ve recently had a 25% of clothes promotion and there was a chance I could have bought it with the discount. I ve never heard of this before and the top is still coming up on your tills at full price. I ve returned items before for an exchange due to loss of receipt (I seem to be terrible at keeping hold of receipts) and have never had to have 25% deducted. is this is new t+c rule or is this is a mistake?  if you could let me know that d be fab! thanks hayley;;;;;2016-09-30T19:55:30+0000;1475265330;2016-09-30 21:55:30;0;10;0;0;10;10;3;7;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

He was surprised to find the package outside his home and spent around 30 minutes to your customer service department  trying to get someone to collect the package.   When the customer service team told him to just deliver the package to me himself  he took the heavy box and walked all the way to my flat to drop it off himself.   Since my delivery was not successfully delivered to my address by your courier  I would appreciate a gesture to thank the kind man who went out of his way this evening to make sure that I received my order.;;;;;2016-09-30T18:19:37+0000;1475259577;2016-09-30 20:19:37;2;5;2;0;7;5;1;4;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was really impressed to see your new vegan cheese range; which you advertise as also suitable for those allergic to milk.  I went into store today to buy some  only to discover that they all have soya in them. Allergy to cows  milk and allergy to soya are very closely linked; 50% of those with a cows  milk allergy are also allergic to soya.  So  unfortunately  I couldn t buy any of your products. It seems a shame that a coconut based product has soya added to it.  Please could you investigate whether or not soya is an essential ingredient in these products? I m sure I m not the only one disappointed.  Thanks.";;;;;2016-09-30T17:43:42+0000;1475257422;2016-09-30 19:43:42;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

My main priority should have been getting my little boy to the car to sort him out. However  as there was a big puddle on the floor and nobody offering to clean it up  I had to wait with the trolly over the  spillage  whilst a Sainsbury s worker took forever to pass me the odd small piece of paper towel to mop it up myself.  I m not saying I expect other people to mop up my child s accidents. However  given the stressful situation and how extremely embarrassed I was  I d of maybe expected someone to either  provide a sufficient amount of paper towels to be able to get the job done and go quickly  rather than leaving me stood there for 10 minutes. Or... Offer to put a wet floor sign down and to go and get my child sorted given he should come first.   Even more disappointing when the person who was in charge of the self serve tills at the time is usually so helpful and polite!   Not nice for parents trying to potty train a child! It s already hard in itself!;;;;;2016-09-29T19:32:18+0000;1475177538;2016-09-29 21:32:18;2;15;5;0;20;15;2;13;19;0;2;0;0;0;3;0;0

Unfortunately the last 3 times I have used the store I have checked on the shelf edge to make sure the product on the shelf above the ticket holds the same description as the shelf edge only to find when checking out that the product is priced above that stated.  In each case I have queried it and been told that the product is the price the till registers and not the price displayed and on each occasion I have been told that somebody  must have put it back in the wrong place.  The last time i was told that a customer had probably done this.  Well all I can say is the customer must have been pretty bored as the shelf was full of the item.  Hence I left without purchasing as this time the difference in price was approx £15.

No explanation has been offered despite my e-mails on 21st and 24th of this month. In fact  not just no explanation but no response at all other than my “chat” on 24th where I was given another e-mail address. That proved futile too.   Worse still  Sainsbury’s have blocked my account.  I live in Greece and a friend was going to bring my order to me. I now understand from him that Sainsbury’s don’t allow customers to take their goods to friends abroad as this is in breach of their terms and conditions.  If this is your policy  however strange – that is your business and right. From a supply point of view it matters not as Asda  Morrisons  Tesco and Waitrose have no such policy. Indeed  to the contrary they have been extremely helpful.  What I will not accept however is Sainsburys downright rudeness to a lifelong customer in refusing to correspond.   To that end I formally request an e-mail contact for Chairmain David Tyler and Chief Executive Mike Coupe. I accept any contact details will go via their PAs.  Furthermore I request e-mail contact details for your press and communications department  so I can ask them to outline the relevant terms and conditions and how they fit in with your company’s values.  If I do not receive a satisfactory response within 1 week (you have already had 8 days)  I will simply give all my information to all media outlets  so they can get to the bottom of this for me (plus of course your press department  Mr Tyler and Mr Coupe will get to hear of the total lack of customer service  irrespective of your right to your own policies. I suspect the headline might be “Sainsbury’s block customer’s account after a friend tries to take bread sauce mix out of the country”.  The 1 week starts today. My thanks in anticipation.

Although mentioned by many as of course great for vegan  the packaging and initial release actually have it as part of a freefrom range  aimed primarily at being free from allergens. Being coconut based therefore made great sense and was welcome news after so many simpky lactose free or soya based cheeses. Imagine our disappointment to then discovet that despite its coconut base  it still contains soya. Not only is soya one of the  big 8  allergens (so common to suffer from)  it s proteins ate very similar to those in cows milk. This means a high percentage of those who cannot have cows milk also cannot have soya. What a shame that this wasnt considered begore adding soya proteins to your coconut based cheeses that could have been such a wonderful find for all the allergy sufferers and carers of allergy sufferers.

About 7.40pm I had a call from the delivery driver to say his van was stuck in mud  he was awaiting a recovery vehicle and it was highly unlikely he d make it to mine. He suggested today as an alternative delivery date but I indicated I was out all day/evening and I offered tomorrow eve instead  to which he implied Sainsbury s would get back to me. By 1.30pm today I d not heard anything so I emailed the Company via the website.  At time of posting on FB I ve still not heard from Sainsbury s. Wonder what s happening please?! My availability for rest of week is limited  hence why I chose to home shop instead of doing it myself.;;;;;2016-09-28T22:40:20+0000;1475102420;2016-09-29 00:40:20;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I m a mum to a baby with CMPA  due to me breastfeeding I have had to cut all foods that contain dairy from my diet  as over 50% of cmpa sufferers are also allergic to soya it s very difficult to find alternative foods that don t contain both these things  (we also have to avoid egg too!)  Sainsburys free from range is great but doesn t normally cut all these things from its products and it would be great if you could maybe do one or two things to help us mums out  the cheese thing would be a great start as we all miss it loads!!😳 Also  when the babies are weaning they also need things to munch  maybe you could do some coconut based yoghurt etc to suit their little tums and gums.

I just witnessed a foreign chap humiliated and bullied by staff at Sainsbury s Chanterland s Avenue Hull.  He was putting items in his bag for life before paying. He had made no attempt to leave the shop.  Whilst still shopping he was hauled to the till and in front of a line of customers was shouted at and told to put everything back. He said he was going to pay and showed staff his cash. He was grudgingly allowed to continue shopping. I pointed out to the belligerent shop assistant that he had done nothing wrong and I was spoken to very rudely and told it was nothing to do with me and I should keep out. The incident happened at around 19.35 tonight 28.09.16. it ll all be on CCTV.

My bank said not their problem  card fine  money in my bank  contact Sainsbury s.  Re rang Sainsbury s who told me  definitely my bank  not them.  Re rang my bank  who put me in touch with the visa department  who said  nothing wrong with my card  but to double check  they de- registered it and re registered it while I was holding on.  Nearly two hours later  I rang Sainbury s again  and paid with my card over the phone!!!   The following week I had the same problem with Sainsbury s and eventually paid again over the phone.  Last week I was told that the problem was with their (Sainsbury s) IT department and it would be looked into and repaired asap..  This week  again  was card was rejected and I had to pay by phone.     Why does it take a huge company like Sainsbury s over four weeks to get their IT department to pull their fingers out?  This has wasted hours of my time patience  cost money with all the phone calls  especially the first week  I cannot easily amend  add or alter my shopping list because I can t pay online  in short  I have lost all faith in Sainsbury s online.

It s great to see this transparency. But please go further and publish more info about food waste in your supply chains! An estimated 4.7 million tonnes is wasted on farms and in factories  before it even gets to the supermarket shelves  compared to only 0.2 million tonnes that occurs in supermarket stores. Based on Sainsbury s market share  this means Sainsbury s supply chain waste could be roughly 790 000 tonnes - over 20 times as much as its in-store waste. And far less of this is redistributed to charities. Please #stoptherot!;;;;;2016-09-28T13:37:26+0000;1475069846;2016-09-28 15:37:26;1;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Around half of those children with an allergy to cow s milk are also allergic to soya  meaning unfortunately these cheeses are not very allergy friendly.    Coconut and soya cheeses are clearly great for vegans (who choose not to eat dairy) but not for those with allergies or intolerances (who have no choice). As it is one of the top 14 allergens  some more soya free and dairy free choices would be great  and it would be worth it to develop some judging by the amount of comments from people in the same position as me.;;;;;2016-09-28T12:41:58+0000;1475066518;2016-09-28 14:41:58;42;38;49;1;88;38;28;10;41;0;42;5;0;0;0;2;0

I must say that I was appalled by the way I was spoken to by one of your members of staff.  I have a 22 month old daughter and had put her in the trolley. I only needed a few bits and I made my way to the check out. I had put my (8) items on the conveyor belt and the cashier screeched  basket only  at me. I was so embarrassed so I put my items back in the trolley and went to another till. As I was paying  I looked at her till  only to see the customer after me  with a trolley with a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. The man after him had a smaller trolley with his shopping in. How were they allowed to go through but I was not. The only reason I actually had a trolley  and not a basket  is because I had my daughter with me. I was in the store around 3/3.30pm. She was on the basket only till. She looked in her late teens with glasses and long frizzy hair (which probably should have been tied back).  I look forward to hearing your response.;;;;;2016-09-28T08:45:10+0000;1475052310;2016-09-28 10:45:10;1;8;1;0;9;8;4;4;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Your £3.00 meal deal tops the others. The cheese and onion how it is applied must of been changed  as is not slopped out the back anymore soaking the packaging and more important to that  not falling onto my lap when you take a bite! However  may I ask why the BLT has been dropped from the meal deal? and why the tuna is as dry as a bone now. What happened to tuna mayo? It looks like now the tuna  is put on top of the mayo. Not a good a move  a tuna mayo is just that tuna mixed with mayo. I love your variety please re-consider the tuna!

Yesterday at your Hawick store on the 26th September at 15:20pm I went and did my usual shop which came to £43 the large bearded sweet chewing man at the till scanned the coupon and informed me that i could not use it as i had a bottle of spirits in my shopping? I explained that i always bought a bottle of spirits with my shopping and the coupon has always been scanned and accepted he flatly refused stating that it says so on the coupon no alcohol which it does. This man was rude and unprofessional in the fact he kept repeating that I was `wrong mate` until i politely told him it was not his position to keep calling me wrong he also kept waving customers away from his till telling them in a loud cynical voice that there was a dispute here and it was going to take a while which was very embarrassing and humiliating for me and my wife. When the manageress turned up she looked and said no even though i had explained as before to the till operator that i have used these in this store the exact same way and for years in other stores and have always been accepted with a bottle of spirits included in my shopping. All in all we left the shopping with the manageress in our shopping bags and she kept our coupon.   Why after all these years have i been getting the same kind of shop with the same coupons and have always been accepted?Me and my wife were humiliated in front of all the other customers by this loud mouthed till operator who could have handled the matter a bit more maturely other than acting like a spoiled child not getting his way.  We will not be returning to your your stores and I will make it my passion to tell everybody about our bad experience in your store i will teach my children to never enter your stores as they are bad places so you will never get any more money from this family ever.;;;;;2016-09-27T12:54:30+0000;1474980870;2016-09-27 14:54:30;0;8;0;0;8;8;3;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

You have a small selection for adults but you could do with some for children.  2. You provide Gluten-free meals in your cafe at no extra charge.. So far your limited to what you can have.. You can have  beans  chocolate brownie and a cherry bakewell.. This isn t good enough really..  You should not charge extra for an allergy.. I m pretty sure thats a trading standards complaint... You charge 50p extra for a Gluten-free bread roll.  The reasons why I m asking for you to consider these is that I am a mum to a 2 year old who has to have a Gluten-free diet and I m sure he s not the only one.. You could expand your meals slightly and open the door for more customers with dietary requirements.. Surely it s a win-win for customers and your income;;;;;2016-09-26T14:21:57+0000;1474899717;2016-09-26 16:21:57;1;8;1;0;9;8;4;4;3;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I shop every day in the same store before and after work  I wear a suit to work  however today on my day off wearing my hoodie and cap. The guy who served me treated me like a fraud commiting criminal.  As I m awaiting my card  I have been having to swipe and sign for it in the sainsburys store  on a regular pretty much every day. However today when dressed in my civilian clothes (hooddie n cap) the cashier pulled my card out of the machine him self as soon as he looked at me. Then said we don t do that swipe thing here  when I explained I ve been doing it here and most sainsburys stores for over a week. He says we are not meant to  to which I replied with finance you are either allowed to or not. He then stated loads of people keep coming in with stolen cards  to which I replied it wasn t an issue all the other wiles I have come in.  And also it s not his hob to make assumptions  I had my drivers licence which showed my name and he signature which was on the card  after that was shown he was more than happy to try over and over. But he never asked for any IDs or proofs first he just tried turing me away.  People should not make up rules and assume thing and they should in no was discriminate due to what someone is wearing.   It was never an issue when I wore a smart suit in store  but as soon as I m wearing a car of a hood  I m treated like a criminal fraudster.   No one explained anything to me in store until after I kicked off  seriously disgusting behaviour from the staff in 2-4 Gloucester Road store bristol...;;;;;2016-09-26T13:23:11+0000;1474896191;2016-09-26 15:23:11;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I think that s the way forward. What disturbs and confuses me  is why you continue to stock John West tuna! Greenpeace tell me that they still use Fish Aggregating Devices which also attract species like sharks  turtles and rays  meaning they re caught as  bycatch . I m also told they haven t met their promise and commitment to using 100% sustainable fishing methods by 2016... that they re only at 2%!!! By my maths that s 98% unsustainable fishing practise on a global scale! If Tesco s and Waitrose have already agreed to put pressure on John West to meet their commitments  why aren r Sainsbury s adding their voice to this argument? Why are Sainsbury s still stocking a product that seems to go against their ethos?  Please can someone explain your reason to continue to support and stock John West tuna?;;;;;2016-09-26T10:13:29+0000;1474884809;2016-09-26 12:13:29;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

As we all know the cooking of roast dinners is all in the timing and I cooked our Sunday roast according to the packet instructions and timings. However after the prescribed cooking time  I found that my chicken still had pink juices  so I cooked it for a further 15 minutes. Again I checked and after this it still had pink juices  so again I cooked it for another 15 minutes. By this point all the other parts of the dinner were ready and I had to remove them from the oven to save them being too over cooked! After the final 15 minutes the juices weren t clear but I d had enough so removed the chicken from the oven - as by this time it was getting late and everyone was getting impatient!  It was upon carving the chicken that I found the problem - all of the offal remained inside the chicken (including the contents of the chickens stomach 😱😷) Now I m not one to complain but I couldn t actually eat the chicken after this and neither could my partner or children. By this time we had all the makings of a roast dinner (albeit a little overdone and a little late) so I had to send my partner to McDonald s for chicken fillets (no offal included) as the shops were no longer open and I didn t have time to cook another chicken! The chicken was in a bag and trussed up so there was no way of knowing about this until we began to carve.  I will send pictures via private message as I wouldn t want to offend anyone. I would appreciate your thoughts on this. Thank you.;;;;;2016-09-26T06:09:13+0000;1474870153;2016-09-26 08:09:13;0;6;0;0;6;6;3;3;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I just thought I d let you know that thanks to your awful cleanliness in your Alton store that my 4 year old son is now being violently sick. Yesterday (Sunday) afternoon when I was leaving your store my son unwittingly stepped in dog diarrhea (told by a member of the public) then as his shoe was slippy for the mess he slipped and fell into some of the afore mentioned diarrhea. When I went inside to tell the manager all I got was in a very disinterested voice  oh sorry - I ll get a cleaner  no offer of even a wipe to help tidy my son up.   It was the same member of the public too that told me that she had also asked for a cleaner - but obviously you hadn t bothered to tidy it up - or my son wouldn t have stepped in it - and now he wouldn t be being violently ill.   We ve had to bin his clothes he was wearing at the time and his shoes he was wearing too.;;;;;2016-09-26T01:34:02+0000;1474853642;2016-09-26 03:34:02;2;6;2;0;8;6;4;2;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ordered the vegetarian lasagne  paid and sat down. A staff member came over 5 minutes later to advise me that they had run out of veg lasagne and would I like to pick something else  I went to the menu board to pick my second option only two hear the staff member chatting with the lady who initially served me at the till. The lady from the till advised the kitchen lady that there were intact some veg lasagne left but they were in the freezer  to which the other staff remember replied  yes but I can t be bothered with all that hassle  absolutely diabolical behaviour. I was then asked to quickly pick another option!!! I picked a jacket potato with prawn cocktail which was beyond horrendous!!! The jacket potato must have been reheated numerous times  the skin was chewy/rubbery and the potato very dry  and as for the prawn cocktail there were only 5 prawns!!! I am disgusted and will definitely not be eating or recommending here again!

However you need to look at a more efficient distribution methodology.  I had 4 parcels to collect this afternoon.   1) Doddle <5 mins 2) marks and Spencer <5 mins 3) Next 8 mins because there was a queue at the till / you have to wait for the person to retrieve the parcel. 4) finally Sainsbury s 45 minutes The process of queuing at customer services with everyone wanting to return / exchange is frustrating  then for the lady serving to have to look my order up on the computer when I m showing her the order number on the email you ve sent me.  Followed by her walking to the old customer collections desk (where d I d been originally  but was send to customer services)  to presumably have a 5 mins chat  and come back empty handed  for then another woman to come over and check my email again.  To then wait another 10 minutes before the box finally appeared.  This is completely inefficient  wasting both my and your staffs time.

The usual Sunday morning gossip with my friend Beth abruptly ended with her screaming for help!!! A call back 10 (very tense) mins later revealed that whilst in the car park and sheltering from the rain she stumbled into a wasps nest and was stung on the eye. As she s had a bad reaction to a bee sting in the past she panicked  a member of the public responded to her cries for help and took her into your Wilmslow branch of Sainsbury s.   A first aider (Vicky) was immediately sought and they began to calm her down. As I rushed to the store to meet my friend  her face began to swell and get worse and so paramedics were called. When I got there and whilst waiting for paramedics  not only was Vicky calm but she managed to keep Beth calm and smiling too. She s was eventually checked over by the paramedic and given the all clear.   And so I wanted to say thank you  not only were Vicky and the manager (could have been called Dan!) calm themselves  they went above and beyond to make sure that my friend was kept calm and looked after  they also were accommodating to my 7 year old daughter who was a little upset at seeing our friend looking a little bit swollen and worse for wear!   They are a credit to your Wilmslow store and I hope they get to see this message on behalf of Beth (who doesn t do social media for some crazy reason!) myself and my 7 year old who is now full of starburst 😘 xxx;;;;;2016-09-25T12:49:55+0000;1474807795;2016-09-25 14:49:55;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I walk up to the counter  pleasant  smile on my face  to be greeted by one of your staff  who doesnt even grace me with a glance as I say    Can I have 17 Sterling Dual  please?

Neither is it good customer service to not only not look at the person they are being paid to serve  but to pass judgement on said customer s age without looking at their face  and basing it purely on their height.  Yes  at 5 3   I may not be statuesque  but a quick glance at my wrinkles and the onset of grey hair is enough to tell you I m slightly more aged than a teenager.

When I arrived at customer services i was greeted with a very rude member of your team. He decided that his job was to interrogate me  then dictate to me how the lunchbox broke and that he wouldn t be giving me a refund. When I explained that the lunchbox lives on a trolleys at school and gets transported to school in a rucksack and that if he wasn t prepared to give me a refund I would like to speak to the store manager. His tune quickly changed and told me to go and find another one.  Unfortunately if this is how your customer service staff speak to your customers I m not sure that people would want to buy from you for the fear of returning to the store.

After your having the banner removed from the fence on the land opposite the entrance to your car park and apologising  the same banner advertising 25% off Tu clothing is back in the same place. I spoke to a manager in the shop tonight  Alex or Alec I believe but he was clearly not in the mood to deal with this and after a pointless exchange to told me he has no intention of removing the banner and suggested I reported you to the police. This demonstrated he lacks the competences to deal with this. He told me he has a master’s degree in law but he doesn’t seem to know the difference between criminal and civil law and what is or isn’t a matter for police. I would be interested to see the risk assessment for sending your staff on to a busy dual carriageway and fixing banners to other people’s property. This is about showing respect for the neighbourhood and other people’s property. Please have the banner removed again and make sure the Central Milton Keynes management team understand they are not allowed to do this and it is an abuse of the neighbourhood. With thanks.;;;;;2016-09-23T19:21:40+0000;1474658500;2016-09-23 21:21:40;0;12;0;0;12;12;4;8;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

On the 9th of September my friend  my son and I went for lunch and ordered your pulled pork cobs and a children s sandwich pack. Halfway through eating our lunch my friend found mould in her bread. She got a refund and also sainsburys was very kind and sent her a gift card. However we all went for a coffee this morning and my 2 year old son wanted a sandwich meal. As the sandwich is prepacked what could go wrong? Well after he had eaten half of it I went to put the rest away to feel that his bread was stale. One of your employees swapped his sandwich for a fresh one. This isn t on. You ve given my friend mouldy bread and now my 2 year old son stale bread. I think something needs to be done to make sure your bread is actually  fresh  as you proudly state it is.;;;;;2016-09-23T09:29:50+0000;1474622990;2016-09-23 11:29:50;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I also purchased a 5p bag. Anyway I went home and my daughter was so excited to see her haloween costume so we pulled it out of the bag to find a slug drop from it  she was horrified screaming I then looked in to the carrier bag to find another slug! I contacted the store straight away to which the guy was speechless and told me to come down he would replace the items and also refund them. Anyway heading down to the store I was seen by a lady that was very helpful told me to go and see if the sizes were available on the shop floor  the deputy manager then came down  he was saying it s either a refund or a exchange  but only wanted to do this with the costume. I explained my children. Would not be wearing something that had slugs over it so he said as a good will gesture he would refund it all. Not only he told me it was just only a slug!!! So to me that s saying he finds it acceptable to find slugs on your clothing!!!! How disgusting my daughter was screaming  and your deputy manager wants to tell me it s only a slug!!! Where was these costumes kept some where damp surely for slugs to appear on them. The customer service was shocking!!;;;;;2016-09-23T08:10:54+0000;1474618254;2016-09-23 10:10:54;0;10;0;0;10;10;9;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The first one I chose was sticky and looked like it had always been left in the rain. It had rust on it and the metal looked like it needed a good scrub. When I went to change it hoping it was a one off all of the others were the same!   Really not good when you have a newborn and want to do some shopping. I really did not feel comfortable using these trolleys with my daughter. To be honest I even doubt a good scrub would get rid of the muck on these trolleys. I really would suggest some new ones be purchased and they be kept inside the trolley bays!   They really were disgusting!;;;;;2016-09-23T07:56:11+0000;1474617371;2016-09-23 09:56:11;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I understand she was  Doing  her job  as she quoted BUT is there no common sense in place?

Came back to check if there was any size 6 boots in the style below after visiting earlier in the week. Couldn t see a member of staff to ask so I took them to the customer service area  after giving me a very annoyed look for disrupting her  the member of staff then made a louder than necessary huff and threw in a good old tut just in case I hadn t heard the first...  I ignored it and asked her if there was any way she could check to see if they had any boots available out the back in a size 6 to which she replied   I can t ask anyone as there s nobody here   what nobody in the whole store ?!   yes all the shop floor staff finish at 4 . For a shop that closes at 10pm that seems pretty bizarre  once I d put them back I saw two staff up the aisle  I was too annoyed to bother by then.  Promptly went over to next to next and spent an extra £25 on almost the same boots but at least got kind and helpful staff! So maybe the member of staff on the customer service area/lotto till needs reminding she works in customers where her job role is primarily helping customers 🙄;;;;;2016-09-22T21:36:55+0000;1474580215;2016-09-22 23:36:55;0;4;0;0;4;4;3;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I m £10 out of pocket and I would like to know how Sainsbury s can resolve this. I feel like I have been robbed. So much for consumer rights!;;;;;2016-09-22T13:47:19+0000;1474552039;2016-09-22 15:47:19;1;6;2;0;8;6;2;4;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;1;0

The replacement prawn salad- not on the meal deal- weighs in at 200 calories more than its predecessor and I hate to say it- isn t as tasty. 652 calories for a lunch isn t something I can do every week anymore. I know there is a diet version in some stores but it s not as filling as the middle sized version. As for the salad itself. I found prawn shell in it that is edible but not entirely palatable. The pasta is drier and once people try it  it s not going to continue to sell. Also it is in your interests to bring back the old prawn salad as I spent £2.60 today for the prawn salad when normally I would spend £3.00 with you with a drink and snack as well. Yes more in costs more money for more food but every penny you make adds up. All those 40ps will add up. I will be taking my business to boots.;;;;;2016-09-22T13:25:39+0000;1474550739;2016-09-22 15:25:39;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Online total was £43.55 and when the delivery arrived I noticed I was charged £50.85. I have been overcharged on 12 items of my 35 item list. Had a text saying a goodwill gesture has been added to my wallet. There is nothing in there. I am 46 years old and am computer  savvy   now I am wondering how many other customers have been affected by this issue and they are not bothering to chase up the discrepancy. (meaning they have been ripped off by Sainsbury s) I tried ringing the helpline last night and was on hold for 30 minutes before I got fed up and hung up. I have tried leaving feedback online and sent a mail this morning with no response.  As I said I am a first time customer  so would have thought I would have received some feedback to my issue. No wonder the supermarkets can notify the country of their superb profit figures!!!;;;;;2016-09-22T09:57:02+0000;1474538222;2016-09-22 11:57:02;0;11;0;0;11;11;5;6;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Secondly having to wait nearly 1 hour for your food to arrive in the restaurant after being told it would be 30 minutes and several of the people behind you getting their meals before you.

Partially defrosted frozen food on nearly every delivery but worse in evening. Poor selection of meat and vegetables. Twin packs of steak are not 2 x single packs but one big and one small steak. Assumptions about modern households perhaps.  The weirdest one was a packer who chose giant vegetables although amusing not helpful. Customer services 30+ minutes wait. Xmas year before last although ordered weeks in advance no turkey but a fantastically expensive one offered instead.

The shopping was well organised and he pointed out and separated the bags contained frozen goods.

I have 8 stone (2 down so far  yay go me! 😆) to lose and following weight watchers. My sister shops at Sainsbury s at least once a week and one day she found the good to yourself cheese and red onion soya crisps. She too is at WW. So we tried them and well we became slightly addicted to them. And at 2 smartpoints they were a healthy treat to have. The weeks have went on and our addiction has got worse  until one day about 3 weeks ago my sister went to buy some of these delicious morsels and could not get them. Every week since she has tried and they are no longer there. We tried the Thai chilli but they were not the same at all. Please Sainsbury s! Don t tell me you have stopped them!! They were one treat We totally looked forward to. 😭😭😭 also tried online shopping and they are not there. I miss them.... 🙄;;;;;2016-09-21T08:37:32+0000;1474447052;2016-09-21 10:37:32;0;7;0;0;7;7;3;4;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I filled my car with diesel and the pump did not cut out properly. Some diesel came out of the filler hole and splashed onto the side of the car and the ground  and a little on my feet.  I mentioned it to the lady in the petrol station and she could not have been more helpful and caring. She immediately took me to the toilets to clean up my feet. She asked me if I needed to replace any of my clothes or my shoes and offered to escort me to the store to get new ones if necessary. She wanted to fill in forms to record the incident  but the splash was so small I did not feel it was necessary. She gave me some money off my bill for the fuel which had ended up on the floor instead of in my tank.   I was unfortunate enough to have a similar experience at Tesco 5 years or so ago  and my experience was completely the reverse. The staff person there - and even the manager who I had to insist was called - could not care less  and on that occasion I ended up driving to A&E in floods of tears. Thank you so much for properly training your staff to be so helpful and caring. Well done Sainsbury s!;;;;;2016-09-21T08:24:57+0000;1474446297;2016-09-21 10:24:57;1;5;1;0;6;5;1;4;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Last Thursday the 15th of September I was packed and ready for an important road trip.  You see my partner and I are from Australia  currently working and travelling through the UK. We had finished our time in Manchester and we in the process of moving our belongings further north.  It was approximately 10am  we stopped at your store to fuel up – both the car and our bellies. After perusing the pre-made sandwich selection  I went for my all time favourite  the egg and watercress. Always a good choice but unfortunately not today.   After eating we hit the road.  Approximately 1 hour later we were driving along the M62 toward Leeds  when all of a sudden it hit me.  Extreme nausea  shivering  sweating  cramps  fever.  Luckily a Welcome Break was just up a few miles. We pulled off the motorway and parked up.   I was so sick with food poisoning  it was debilitating and I was unable to continue our journey.  We booked into a room at the Days Inn Bradford (£60 later) so I could sleep off the illness.   Obviously  we didn’t make it to our destination and other arrangements had to be made (within the time restraints we had) causing excess stress to my already sick and weak body.  I just wanted to let you know as I am a physically fit and healthy man who became violently ill. I would hate to imagine if this happened to a small child or an elderly person.

I spent an hour browsing through your TU clothing  for my little girl. Hoping to take advantage of the 25% off  but was disappointed with the low stock. I understand this could be due to the sale being on - never mind  I ll have a look online. I then had to do a food shop. On my way to the checkouts  I veered to the left towards one of the tills - to which a member of staff held her hand up to me  and said  Sorry  he s first   and beckoned the man behind me to the till instead. He had a full trolley (fuller than mine)  and although he was behind me  for some reason  she felt that it was acceptable to let him pay before me. He didn t have any help with loading the shopping onto the checkout  no help packing  didn t appear to be in a rush - so I have no idea why on earth he was allowed to pay and leave before me  even though he was behind me. Anyway  I moved to the next checkout  and seriously considered leaving the damn trolley and walking out. Let me tell you something - I d planned to do the food shopping yesterday  but my dog is poorly and decided to mess on my living room carpet. And my teething daughter was in a horrendous mood yesterday  so I spent the day at home  and part of it was spent in tears. Perhaps I should ve ordered online yesterday  but my daughter wouldn t have given me the time to do so. So  today was the day I had to do the food shopping  because the cupboards are bare! So although I felt wound up and confused  I couldn t leave the shopping there - my daughter would ve been upset if I hadn t bought those Peppa Pig yogurts! I loaded my shopping onto the checkout  and did consider mentioning the situation to the lady about to serve me (Tracey. I didn t see the name of the other lady.) but  I don t like confrontation  and I thought better of involving her. This checkout lady Tracey  threw me a glare when my shopping knocked on of those divider things off the side. Whoops  my bad. She didn t appear to be in a very friendly mood. She didn t ask if I needed help packing (I never accept anyway)  she didn t make conversation  she proceeded to tell me  That s £75  with no please  so didn t tell me that my card had been declined  I found that out for myself. But  hurrah  she did say a very quiet  thank you  before I left. Strange  as she seemed chatty to the couple who she served before me. Perhaps I d done something to piss both these members of staff off. Perhaps it was my face - I even made an effort putting make up on today! Perhaps they didn t like my daughter - maybe they saw her throw a raisin on the floor a little bit earlier on. Or perhaps I wasn t spending enough. Who knows! By this point  I was wound up  and mentally preparing what to write here. And thankfully my daughter has given me the time to write this - thank God for Iggle Piggle! Anyway  I m not writing this because I want a few extra Nectar points (which is what I had when I had a crane fly in my spinach last year). I don t want a £10 Sainsbury s voucher (which is what I had when I had an insect in my grapes a few months ago - which I had to take into store to prove!) I m not after a freebie. I tell you what I would like - an apology. And I suggest that somebody contacts the Bridgend store by the end of today  and recommendeds a bit of restraining - even if it s only to remind the staff to say please and thank you. Or to remind them that it s first come first serve at the checkouts - isn t it?? I can t help but feel all these annoyances lately  are telling me I should be shopping somewhere else. I would be more than happy to add up how much I spend instore  online  on groceries and clothing  and on petrol  per month! Sometimes I think I should get my wages paid directly to Sainsbury s! If it wasn t the closest supermarket  I wouldn t shop there. I think I ll start venturing a bit further now. I m rather fed up of being pissed off after leaving there.   Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope I haven t pissed you off in the way that Tracey and the other lady have pissed me off - that wasn t my intention.  Sincerely   One fed up mum  who forgot to pick up beef mince.;;;;;2016-09-20T12:39:21+0000;1474375161;2016-09-20 14:39:21;6;5;7;1;13;4;1;3;1;0;6;1;0;0;0;0;0

It s against company policy  I can t  he said and just carried on scanning!  I was so angry.  I had to quickly finish sorting my things and help her.

My order arrived over 2 hours late on Saturday with half my shopping missing! Then I had to wait 20 minutes on the phone before I could talk to someone who told me that I m  lucky  to have received it at all (am I missing something that s what you expect to happen when you order your shopping on line?!)  then I get told that the rest of my shopping will be delivered later that day which it wasn t and that I would have to wait a week for my card to be refunded for the over payment I d like to know why seen as you were quick enough to over charge me! Then the following morning I have to ring again to ask where the other half of my shopping is and I am told it will be with me in the next hour so I wait and wait finally it turns up at 5.30 pm after being stuck in the house with my son for 2 days and I still have shopping missing!

He truly deserves a medal. He is an absolute credit to you and your store;;;;;2016-09-17T21:51:46+0000;1474149106;2016-09-17 23:51:46;27;7;29;2;38;7;5;2;3;0;27;2;0;0;0;0;0

Now I wasn t too fussed but what s really angered me is when I rang up to see if I could have my shopping I was told I had been refunded but they would ring the store to see if they could redeliver.. I was told the store was too busy and it d be delivered Monday!!!! Now that is a p**s take! I paid for it to be delivered between 6&7 yesterday! I have a newborn baby and a toddler that has been throwing up all day I have nothing in the fridge and I m not able to get out to buy anything! I m now having to wait until Monday because of someone else s incompetence!;;;;;2016-09-17T20:48:13+0000;1474145293;2016-09-17 22:48:13;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

She recently placed an order over £200 and ordered it to come by 10am.  She waited in all morning until 11am before phoning the customer service helpline.   when phoning and explained that she had waited in all morning  she was spoken to rudely and was told her order did not fit on the truck that morning and so her order was therefore cancelled.   As a valued customer of whose orders are made every two weeks and are regularly in excess of £200  this was not deemed acceptable.  When asked why this was cancelled without prior confirmation  she was responded to with an unsincere apology and the call was disconnected.  As a result  my mother was unable to proceed with her lunchtime get together as intended and her friends resorted to having to settle with a pub lunch.  Had i realised that this is the way Sainsburys treat their valued customers  i would not have bothered shopping at your stores myself. You portray Sainsburys to be a great supermarket but you obviously dont have thought for your loyal customers;;;;;2016-09-17T20:28:46+0000;1474144126;2016-09-17 22:28:46;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Last Tuesday I was treated like dirt in one of your stores and rang head office and complained. Spoke to a Scott Stevenson who said he would send me a £50 gift card as way of apology for the awful way I was treated with my newborn son. It was being sent out first class last Wednesday. By Monday this week it still hadn t arrived. Chased it up with yourselves on here and someone called Amanda sent me a gift card out which did indeed arrive. However bearing in mind I was told it would be active within 72 hours of being sent  and still isn t active I called head office again. Whilst on the phone I noticed on the letter it states it takes 72 hours from when I recieve it not from when it s sent out to me to become active (I m slightly puzzled as to how sainsburys think they know at what time my post arrives?!) but anyway the bloke at head office came back to me and has just told me the card will never actually activate unless I register it myself online....now this is 3 different things I ve been told by sainsburys    1. Active within 72 hours of being sent out  2. Active within 72 hours of me recieveing it   3. It will never be active unless I register it and then it will take 72 hours after registering it for it to become active.  WHICH ONE IS IT SAINSBURYS???   and is there any chance someone high up at sainsburys can do some staff training to ensure ALL staff are singing from the same hymn sheet and telling people the same thing? It s disgusting to not actually be sent out the original card when stated it would be  but to then have this farce is just beyond a joke! Also seen a few posts on this page from others about cards not being active  makes me wonder which version they got told and which version is actually the truth?!;;;;;2016-09-16T14:28:53+0000;1474036133;2016-09-16 16:28:53;0;8;0;0;8;8;6;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

As I only saw tis in your store the other day and the post I am talking about is a year old with several complaints on the item and I right to think that these issues have now been resolved with it and it no longer sinks and lets water in the battery compartment ?  Really hope so as want to get it as a gift and cant see how it can still be being sold if these have not been fixed a year later?

Was asked at the tills for my  Nectar  card  but discovered I hadn t one with me. I decided to ask the lady behind me if she had HER card with her  she didn t  but the lady behind HER had. I asked for it  so that I could put the points I had earned on her card instead  (waste not  etc. ). At which point the teenager behind the till announced that she was not allowed to do that. I challenged her  she asked the  manager   who confirmed that  no  she couldn t do that. Why not? Just can t. Brilliant. So  whose points are they? Why have I never had a problem in the store(s) when doing this? That particular over-blown shop has lost AT LEAST 1 customer  maybe more  as there was a very un-impressed queue behind me who saw and heard everything  and told me that they too were pretty disgusted.

My 23 month old daughter had a horrendous accident whilst in store this morning and within seconds there where numerous members of staff who helped me and my daughter immensely both in calming her down and then in sorting out a staff member to take us the hospital in her own car. My daughter was sick all over the ladies car on route (and it wasn t just a bit) After I d checked her in at the hospital and we were waiting to be seen  a lady from the store arrived with a carrier bag filled with a change of clothes for both of us! Nappies and wipes incase I needed them whilst we waited and also a cuddly toy for my daughter to comfort her. I actually welled up at this point with both a mixture of such absolute gratitude and utter distress. I can t thank those staff members enough for helping keep us calm and also for the aftercare I felt I received. I only wish I had taken note of all there names as when I returned to store - some 6 and a half hours later nobody on customer services knew anything about it and so couldn t help with who it may have been and so I couldn t thank them personally. Obviously I will try and return to store tomorrow to thank the staff but I felt in the meantime if someone could please let the store know that they have some real diamonds working there and I m eternally grateful xx;;;;;2016-09-15T16:58:23+0000;1473958703;2016-09-15 18:58:23;10;28;13;2;43;23;9;14;9;0;9;2;1;0;0;0;0

I was at a self service checkout when a lady approached with a very animated man whose arm she had hold of and who was waving around a china cup.  She explained that she was a support worker and the gentleman she was with had autism and learning difficulties and had a thing about cups.  He had taken one from the shelf which cost £3 but he only had £2 and was becoming very anxious at not being able to go through the checkout with the cup he had chosen.  The support worker advised she had asked to speak to a manager but was letting them know she was  going through the process  of the checkout to calm the gentleman down.  I reached across and gave her a £1 coin so the gentleman could buy the cup he wanted  she thanked me and they went on their way.  One of your assistants at the self service came over and told me it was a nice thing to do.  I said if that was my Dad or Brother or Son  I d want someone to step in and just make his day a bit easier - and it was only a pound.  Another assistant came over smiling and agreed with the first assistant and then the first one went over to customer services.  She came back just as I was paying and getting ready to leave.   The care worker gave me a card to give to you   she said and then handed me a pound.   This is from Sainsbury s.  We are going to put his cup through our till and pay the pound.   The card read   Freeways.  Hello.  Sorry I couldn t stop and talk.  I am a support worker.  I am supporting an adult with autism and learning difficulties.  If you have any questions or comments please call us on (and left a number).  So bless this lady who is a credit to the company she works for and and bless that checkout lady who is a credit to Sainsbury s.   So shines a good deed in a weary world  ~ Willy Wonka;;;;;2016-09-15T15:48:07+0000;1473954487;2016-09-15 17:48:07;232;29;255;21;305;29;24;5;33;0;231;21;2;0;0;0;0

I agree and thank you for the affordable cost however it is ALWAYS stale and falls apart and so  so  so incredibly dry  have you ever had to do the cinnamon challenge... well i recommend you do it to get some perspective of what the struggle is like just to  enjoy  a sandwich. I understand that gluten free people seem to give an impression that they rather enjoy the taste of cardboard but I can promise you any time you can find something close to what you remember it should taste and smell like  you stock up like there is going to be an apocalypse.   Look I understand its hard to use different ingredients to make a product that looks and taste great especially gluten free  cause lets face it nothing beats the real thing. But unless I (and many others) suddenly find enjoyment in looking bloated/about 6 months pregnant.... permanently clutching my stomach in agony your alternative and a very slim selection of others is the best and all we ve have got.   So what I am asking is  can you PLEASE review your mixture  consult someone who is gluten intolerant/coeliac to taste test it  find a way to make it not stale before you even have a chance with it and send it out new and improved at the same cost (cause the gf stuff already costs an arm and a leg).   I would greatly appreciate this  seriously it would make my day.   I look forward to hearing from you and tasting the improvement.

CS assistant refused to accept it because I had some wine. I showed her the words but she refused to understand them.  I finally asked her if she was going to refuse to accept it and looked as I was going to make a complaint involving her response.  She called a supervisor. He did not really seen to understand the situation but agreed to put it through the CS till. And it worked  so some success there as I got the 6p off voucher.. No apology though.  But he managed to refund me £5.50 and charge me £33.00 so I have now got to go back and waste time arguing to get the balance of £27.50 refunded to me.   I don t think it was intentional but just because he was not very sure of what he was doing. He did seem quite calm though but did not give me all the till papers to check there.  When I have been so badly messed about  I would expect to go and make my views known to the store manager.  But he is conveniently on holiday!

I being very anxious in general was in a fluster  particularly because i hadn t left the checkout and another customer seeing i was having issues decided to move me along so she could make her purchases.  Immediately after the bag split I was rescued by the most wonderful lady! Christine was an absolute diamond! She helped me collect my things and fetched me a bag  taking me to an empty self service checkout to pay for the bag.  I told her I will give feedback as she was ever so helpful and even though i have worked in retail for 15 years  I find that level of service is rare these days.  She told me she absolutely loves what she does for a living and you can tell! She is a credit to your store and the company!

When I went to buy one the day before the party there were none left. This extremely kind member of staff rang Otley branch (near to where he lives) and got them to reserve one - he then picked it up before he started work the next day  and brought it into store for me to pick up from him!   When I thanked him effusively he simply said  You are one of our customers ! Please thank him for me - it was over and above the course of duty  and I am very grateful. His kindness and helpfulness will long be remembered in our house. He is a true reflection of superb customer service.;;;;;2016-09-15T07:55:57+0000;1473926157;2016-09-15 09:55:57;9;7;10;0;17;7;3;4;2;0;8;1;0;0;0;0;0

I feel the same passion about Sainsbury s that I must currently bestow upon my local Krogers...except you have a far more brilliant array of maroon and orange festive colors while Kroger is just blue.   However  in recent weeks a great sadness has settled in on me. You see  with no current plans to be back in the U.K. anytime soon  I definitely wouldn t get to experience the beautiful array of mayonnaise choices that I grew to love (lemon is on point!).

Now I m a graduate student  so I m quite poor and it s not that I want another mouth to feed. Rather  I find myself dreaming of having a reason to interact with the Sainsbury s customer service.   It is clear to me that your store employs a fine lot of jovial people  and if my research doesn t work out  perhaps one day I will try to join the team. Otherwise  I will simply have to return to the U.K. after I m employed to scour the stores for produce + stowaway friends.

The problem I have had on this and my previous visit is that I have parked in a child space but there is not a trolley bay on that row. I have  however  learned that at any supermarket the trolley collectors are very efficient at removing the child trolleys from the bay s near the child spaces (where they are needed) and putting them at the front of the store. So I carried roughly a stone in weight (not easy with carpel tunnel left over from pregnancy) to the front of the store  there were only the two usual types of trolley  So I trudged through to the other side near all of the disabled spaces but only to find wheelchair trolleys ( you have that right  at least) and child trolleys with plastic seats. I therefore had to put my daughter s car seat in a regular  high trolley and squash my shopping around it. I didn t need too much today so that was achievable if a little tricky. Here s the thing  there are lots of things as a new mum that can be a bit overwhelming and your first few trips to the supermarket alone with your baby is one of them. Now I could have done my shopping online (not without its inconveniences as the doorbell rings mid-breastfeed or just as you ve got baby to sleep) but us mums need to pop out of the house at least once a day for the sake of our sanity and sometimes for extra nappies or forgotten items and let s face it sometimes us breastfeeding mums just need some chocolate and our formula feeding friends the odd bottle of wine to ease us through the sleep deprivation. So come on sainsburys  make it a little easier on us and put the baby trolleys near the parent parking. In our hormonal  sleep deprived state it could make the difference between feeling like we ve climbed Everest or sobbing in the car park.;;;;;2016-09-14T14:43:46+0000;1473864226;2016-09-14 16:43:46;2;4;3;0;7;4;2;2;2;0;2;1;0;0;0;0;0

This has happened multiple times now. And when I get home and go to cook my fresh chicken that is still in-date by 3 days I find out its gone off. Why are you so sh*t??   I wish I lived closer to a Tesco or a Waitrose or an ASDA  Aldi  Iceland  Lidl  M&S  etc.  All I wanted is some fresh chicken and a carrier bag. Surely you can manage that?

Further to my issue of being debitted an extra £97 on top of my agreed amount  I have now received written confirmation from sainsburys that they are able to charge whatever they decide to price the item at on the day of delivery without any consultation with the customer.  Obviously  as I can t afford a potential £50000 for a toaster  I shall not be darkening sainsburys doorway or website ever again but I would like to advise the chain that there may be people out there who have missed mortgage payments due to the lack of limit on extra monies to potentially be taken being less than explicit.

Been using it for years.   Unfortunately  last night all the chilled stuff from our order was missing. Genuine mistake  relatively easily rectified. No problem.   BUT - it took a significant wait (15 or so minutes) on the online careline to get an answer and a further 10 for a response from the store. The response was that the store would call us to rearrange the delivery. We heard nothing til 10 at night. The store would call us in the morning to rearrange delivery.   I heard nothing. Eventually I had to call again.  Waited 15 minutes again for my call to be answered and at that point found out that we d been put through to the wrong store the night before and still no delivery would be coming our way tonight. Also  it wasn t clear when the store would be able to deliver our order. They would try to get it to us in the morning but it would be  more convenient for the store  if I would be able to stay in to receive it at a later point in the day.  I would have thought the delivery would be coming at my convenience.   When I asked how it could be that we were put through to the wrong store and not be notified of the mistake  the customer service representative couldn t give me answer. He did note that the store that called me last night had flagged up the issue but the message was not passed on.   As mentioned  we ve always experienced a good level of service with our online orders and when we did get through to the careline everyone was very polite. But there are 2 main issues - 1) it takes altogether too long to get through to the careline when a problem does need to be resolved. 2) There was some appalling communication between your teams internally and with us on what was happening to our order and we still don t have it more than 24 hours later.   I hope you can address the issue with your team and I hope my order comes tomorrow. I would have been more confident about that before today s fiasco.;;;;;2016-09-13T20:13:58+0000;1473797638;2016-09-13 22:13:58;0;11;0;0;11;11;3;8;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ordered a ps4 and games package for delivery today   which was supposed to be a gift for someone. Stock was checked before ordering as I wasn t allowed to place the order until the website had checked our area. I have just had the delivery driver here telling me I m very sorry the ps4 is out of stock but we have charged and sent you two games that were with offer. Now a bit of common sense would have said what use are the games without a console and is the customer actually daft enough to pay full price for said games that were included in a ps4 bundle. So I now have to wait up to 5 days for a refund of said games when it took Sainsbury s 24hrs to take it. Oh and the email supposedly sent informing me of it bring out of stock doesn t even exist    as if it did I would have made sure to let you know before delivery that games were of no use without a console.  You even have my mobile no as you used it yesterday to text me details of delivery and no message via that either regarding stock level.Really not impressed!!;;;;;2016-09-13T19:35:44+0000;1473795344;2016-09-13 21:35:44;1;5;1;0;6;2;2;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Had a really bad experience from your Taunton Hankridge store this morning. I decided to buy my son a playstation 4 for his upcoming birthday and I ordered it from your online click and collect service.  I went through the process of registering my details as a new customer and even managed to get myself a cheeky  new customer  discount code. Ordered the ps4 and three games which were in a deal and proceeded to checkout. I received a confirmation email and had booked a slot to collect between 8 and 9 this morning.  Off I trundle at 7:40 am this morning from bridgwater  which is approx 11 miles away  got to hankridge store by around 8 am and then sat and waited. Waited until 8:20 am when I decided I needed to go and see someone instore as there was clearly no one to serve me. I went into the store and straight to your customer service desk where I was greeted by a chap who I think was called Nico. This chap who I believe to be called Nico listened to my story and then began to make some phone calls.  When Nico got off the phone he realised my worst fears  there was no ps4 to collect as they were out of stock. Now as I m not completely deluded I do realise that stock runs out! What I am miffed about are as follows: • How can people be allowed to order things online the day before that aren t in stock? • Considering sainsburys had 2 forms of contact (email and mobile number) why didn t anyone feel the need to let me know? • and probably most importantly my sons not getting his ps4. I was given a £10 gift card by Nico from customer services who to be fair did everything by the book  but at the end of the day I was promised something that wasn t delivered and was told by Nico that he didn t know when anymore ps4 s would be delivered to store and even when some were delivered I would need to re order again via the website for click and collect. What s to stop the same thing happening again?? Come on sainsburys  sort this out!  Ben Macriner.;;;;;2016-09-13T19:00:59+0000;1473793259;2016-09-13 21:00:59;3;22;3;0;25;22;13;9;10;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

The hour delivery slot passes with me sat like a lemon waiting for a knock at the door  and with other things to be getting on with in my life  I decided to phone the customer service line to find out if it would be arriving soon. After being kept on hold for 15 minutes  a chap in your call centre informed me that the delivery hadn t been made because there was no stock  which begs a couple of questions. Firstly  why was it available on your store if there were none available? I had to give you my postcode before ordering. Surely you know how much stock you have of high-ticket items like PS4s? Secondly  why was I not informed of the cancellation? Is it customary to keep new customers waiting for orders that will never arrive?  When I asked what was going to be done about it  I was helpfully told that I would be reimbursed my first order voucher  despite having no intention of using your store again. No gesture of goodwill was forthcoming over the mistake Sainsbury s made  or the fact I d spent 15 minutes listening to a constantly interrupted and dreadful cover of Depeche Mode. I m not sure why you think I d use your store again  but it s alright  because your chap in the call centre told me the voucher was valid for a couple of years  so at least I ve got a while to ignore it and continue shopping elsewhere before I can t use it anymore.  I was also told I could always just order it again  which seems to ignore the glaringly obvious point that the thing is out of stock in the first place  and that I d ordered the bundle at the time I ordered it because it was at a good price. It also ignored that you ve now completely removed all games consoles from your online store  with a search for  Playstation  bringing back results of just a controller. I m sure that ll work really well with my toaster.;;;;;2016-09-13T18:20:10+0000;1473790810;2016-09-13 20:20:10;1;4;1;0;5;4;1;3;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

After taking advantage of your online deal for the PS4 + games last night my delivery driver shows up with games but no PlayStation.    Here s the managers number if they can find you one the deal should still be honoured ring at 9am and speak t the online manager at the branch   Great I m prepared to travel after all I ve got a day off.   In the mean time I ring your online help desk to see if there s one I can find.  There s a team set up to deal with this they will call you back at 10am  still awaiting that call but in fairness it s not 10am yet.   In the mean time I come on here to see that rather than being out of stock it appears I could well be in the process  like Micheal below me  of being fobbed off.   To hear that this deal as been honoured for many people already and after placing my order while all the goods were in stock is quite frankly unacceptable. You either decline the deals for everyone or honour it for everyone.   I ll wait to hear what the online team dealing with this have to say but at the moment I am a very disgruntled customer to say the least. You can t have one rule for some and another rule for others.;;;;;2016-09-13T08:41:23+0000;1473756083;2016-09-13 10:41:23;3;7;3;0;10;7;2;5;2;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was then told sorry we don t have any can t help!  So no healthy choice for meal deal  by then my  pop  in taken up a stupid amount of time.

(Mansfield)   Just went and got some trousers and picked up two pairs in the sale  both clearly at half price. Great.  Only when paying  one pair was coming up full price. The check out guy said they d have to check with clothing  fair enough. Perfectly understandable.  There s a group of staff stood to the side chatting about their personal lives  just staring at my family.   The clothing lady returns to say they ve been marked up wrong. I then question why it should be the issue of the customer if staff aren t marking items correctly and the guy at the check out agreed.  They rudest member of staff then says loudly  Well some people just put the stickers on things! Not saying it s you doing it but how are we to know!  I go to walk away as she s annoyed me  my boyfriend was just getting his card out to pay she exclaims  Erm pay for your goods before you leave the store!  I say my boyfriends doing it as we speak!   In front of my daughter and other shoppers this is. How humiliating over a pair of trousers! If they had explained nicely I wouldn t have minded but to be spoken to like I m potentially smuggling class A s through customs is a little out of order over a pair of trouser marked up incorrectly. I guess the rude lady didn t like being distracted from her chat about private matters! As we left she muttered under her breath.  It s left us not really wanting to return.

I am regular customer at your Tadcaster branch and after the devastating floods that the town suffered and the fact your store is cut off from one half on the town I have made a point of continuing to support it with my custom. However today I was a bit annoyed at the customer service. The store has one those machines in it that you put £1 in and kids get a toy in a plastic ball. These machines are rather attractive to my 4 year old Son. He asked if he could have a toy from one but I did not have any change so I asked at the Kiosk to change a £5 note for £1 coins. I was refused as it is  against the rules to give change  This upset my 4 year old obviously he did not understand why  even though he burst into tears in the shop there was still no exception made. I appreciate that there are rules etc... however I do not believe exceptions cannot be made. I suggest that you should not have machines that entice and attract small children if you cannot provide the common courtesy to give change out for them  I believe that is a fair point.;;;;;2016-09-12T18:08:11+0000;1473703691;2016-09-12 20:08:11;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I approached the desk with my husband  carrying a basket of items and instead of being greeted I got snapped at by your colleague that if I had more than 5 items I would have to go to another  till. I had chosed this till as I wanted a scratchcard as well. So we counted our items and thankfully we had exactly 5 so with no form of warm reception we were beckoned to move forward. The colleague then continued to complain that her till wasn t suited for the larger items ( I was purchasing a large bag of rabbit food) and was reluctantly scanning through my goods. When I handed her the bag of rabbit food she took it in one hand and then let it drop in front of me saying I would have to lift it on the scanner myself as she couldn t do it as once again her till wasn t the right size for this item. We weren t offered a bag and the general feel of the transaction was that we were stopping her from doing nothing  which was something she was doing very well when we approached her. She also told us to get a new nectar card as our one didn t scan properly. Overall very  very poor service and an incredibly rude assistant. Will use self service from now on and leave my impulse and add ons to other stores who actually want to serve me.;;;;;2016-09-12T16:51:38+0000;1473699098;2016-09-12 18:51:38;2;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

A member of staff went and got us a chair and the first aider came over.

Power outage in the area at 10:10 meant store operating on generator only. All fridges were curtained off however a colleague was stationed at every aisle directing customers to the correct shelf for their purchase meaning very little disruption to their shopping. When power finally re-established at about 11:00  the tills took a short while to re-boot but again staff on hand to open up extra tills and get the customers on their way. Store Manager  Sonja very visible  directing her staff and making sure all the customers knew what was happening.

They are under going a refurbishment at the moment. As part of this they have new trollies now and I do not like them.  I bought a token which I ve kept on a key ring but now I cannot use it.  The new trollies seem to be designed to use coins only! (?) I am unable to remove the token from the key ring and insert it  as my fingers are not strong. So I had to accost shoppers to give me a £1 coin in exchange for my loose change which I had trouble finding. I tend not to carry change as I pay by card for most things.  This is a poor example of design. Sainsbury s must be aware that many of its customers  (especially at Chafford Hundred) are more mature and like me rely on the token on a key ring to be able to get a trolley from the store. Could we please have a few of the old style trollies returned?;;;;;2016-09-09T18:37:34+0000;1473446254;2016-09-09 20:37:34;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

He really couldn t have cared less. Long story short a female assistant asked if she was ok and when she said no and explained about car she did offer to phone police however mum just wanted to call my dad. However  Sainsbury left her to her own devises never even offered to help her look for car or even to get her a taxi home! She had to struggle home with shopping.

I have an allergy to dairy and used to have a fairly wide variety of sandwiches I could couse from. Now I have about 3! I depended on your choice of food on my way too and from work as I knew what it contained and had a good choice! Is there any reason why you have chosen to do this and inadvertently exclude thise with allergies and dietary requirements to buy on the go food from your shops?;;;;;2016-09-08T21:27:16+0000;1473370036;2016-09-08 23:27:16;2;5;2;0;7;5;3;2;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Over a year ago my young daughter got stuck in one of the toilet cubicles due to the flimsy lock being in need of repair  the part on the outside where a screwdriver would normally open the lock was completely sheared off due to this having to be done many times before. The staff did say it happened a lot and agreed the locks needed repair. The staff on the day were very helpful and got a ladder to rescue my daughter  and gave her a slush puppy to apologise. I asked the customer service desk at the time to pass on to management my positive experience of how it was handled. Since then I ve noticed all the locks are now in the same state of disrepair and I mentioned it at customer services months ago.  Now that the  refurbishment  is now completed it s disappointing to see nothing has been done to bring the toilets into a reasonable condition. We visited today and the locks are still awful  and as is often the case one cubicle is out of order. Also whilst it s no longer an issue for me personally  the baby changing rooms are almost impossible to negotiate a pushchair into with the awkward door and wall positioning/tight turn inside. Of all the areas that needed addressing instore it was these - the rest of the store was actually fine as it was!;;;;;2016-09-08T20:17:55+0000;1473365875;2016-09-08 22:17:55;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

First was the cheapest frozen prawns - horrible  then the standard ones from the cold counter - yuk. Upped the cost and went for Sainsubury s Large Peeled Cooked Frozen Prawns  and then the same (as far as I can tell) from the cold counter. They all have the same horrible texture  a jelly like  tasteless bit of pink salty nothingness. Certainly couldn t serve them up as a side and not really passable for a decent sandwich filling. Most of the king prawns have the same glassy texture (Shell on King Prawns being the only exception).  If you want an example of how frozen prawns should taste - try Waitrose Canadian Prawns. Meaty  tasty and definitely something you could eat on its own or as part of another dish. Come on Sainsbury s some of your food is better than Waitrose  - don t let this be another one on the avoid list. Seafood should not be this bland  I ve caught and cooked both shrimp and prawn  they do not have a glassy texture. What on earth are your suppliers doing to them?;;;;;2016-09-08T15:10:11+0000;1473347411;2016-09-08 17:10:11;1;8;1;0;9;8;1;7;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Zoe  from the Westhoughton branch  is absolutely amazing. She s fantastic with my children  especially my autistic son  Oliver. She s always ready with a smile  talks to him with enthusiasm even when he won t respond (and he usually doesn t)  and is patient and understanding with us both  when I m struggling to bag my items while he s kicking off his shoes or trying to crawl out of his buggy. She s happy to give my four-year-old daughter a dozen high fives (she s obsessed with high fives right now)  and listens intently to her rapid-fire talk about whatever show or toy she s in to in the moment.  Zoe is the epitome of Excellent Customer Service. As the mother of an autistic child  I find shopping painful at times  overwhelmed with fear that people are judging me and my child  and stressed from trying to get through the experience without forgetting something or losing one of his shoes  socks or dummies. Whenever I see Zoe on the tills  I make a beeline for her  because I know I don t have to worry about any of that with her.   She definitely deserves to be recognised for her outstanding service. A big THANK YOU to Zoe from me and Ollie. <3;;;;;2016-09-08T12:44:51+0000;1473338691;2016-09-08 14:44:51;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I applied for one around a month and half ago due to needing it to rent a car on holiday in which I go in a weeks time! So I was pretty much relying on it ! I applied and got accepted the paperwork came I signed it and sent it off ! It stated a bank statement with my address on would be fine on the letter ! So I went to the bank got one printed off they stamped it and sent that along with my passport! To then find out 2 weeks later the statement was not good enough because it was not posted through my door! Even though the bank had stamped it ! But okay so I rang up and had a conversation with a employee and explained my partner pays the bills and I pay the mortgage so not many utility bills are in my name   I found a water bill from seven Trent and asked if that would be fine  the employee checked with her manager and came back and said water bill is more than fine ! I explained my situation that I am going on holiday in around 3 weeks and made it clear I m relying on it so then read everything on the water bill to her so I can be 100% sure  she assured me the card would come a week before I am due to go away and again the water bill is fine! another 2 weeks later I am starting to get a bit worried as to what s going on so I rang up yesterday to get told the water bill has not been accepted and is not good enough   not once did I get told this   if I didn t of rang up I wouldn t of known! so after paying for recorded delivery parcels  trips to the bank and numerous phone calls I am now a week away from my holiday and no further forward! What a complete waste of my time! If I knew this from the start I would not of bothered!  So I rang my bank and explained the situation I applied with them last night didn t have to sign or send anything and my cards in the post and will be with me within 5-7 days! Let s just hope it comes before next weekend! So thanks sainsburys ! Top job there ! That s the last time I eat shop or fill up my car in sainsburys again!

Please provide this disgruntled customer with a thorough analysis of the thought process (or lack thereof) of the decision makes when arriving at this suicidal commercial decision.   Prima facie evidence such as that of well respected economic articles suggests that sainsburys will regret this price hike and therefore why have the board not immediately intervened; putting the meal deal pricing fiasco to an end and returning the blood pressure of both shareholders and customers to normality.   As a further aside the covert/stealth style tactics used upon implementation of the new meal deal regime are to my mind best described  as both unethical and abhorrent. when trying to establish what was now included I heard numerous customers muttering to themselves or to other customers about the lack of clarity as to what is now included in the deal.";;;;;2016-09-07T21:14:32+0000;1473282872;2016-09-07 23:14:32;4;10;4;0;14;10;3;7;4;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

What was great about the meal deals is the price quality and selection  with this new system you have managed to take a step back on all 3. Whereas previously your meal deals offered more than Tesco or Morrison s (and hence why I chose Sainsbury s over them)  they are now frankly worse than any other retailer...

Did you know that my favourite sandwich ever has to be your Taste The Difference Ham Hock  Cheddar and Ale Chutney? I have never eaten such a wonderful sandwich in all my life - the ham hock is tasty  the cheddar adds a beautiful contrast  and the ale chutney is out of this world divine - fizzy and ale-ly  and I don t even drink alcohol! (And not once have I found any ale chutney on sale in Sainsbury s itself  but that s a different matter!)

From what I ve discovered  my favourite sandwich is no longer part of the meal deal  which is genuinely the saddest news I ve read today. I don t know how I m going to cope with choosing another option now. Will it be Ploughmans or will it be just plain cheese and ham? Oh  Sainsbury s. I m so gutted right now.

I m a cub scout leader & employee of Lifeways & next year we have a jamboree taking place in Iceland next year for our young adults 18-24 promoting change. This camp will accommodate 5 000 plus IST (international service team) which i have been selected to go help.  We are currently looking at fundraising ideas & have come up with a jail break where the Midlands Contingent will be dropped off at a mystery location with no money or mobile & have to get ourselves back. We are looking at getting a badge designed for our contingent which our new UK chef commissioner has agreed to judge so we can get made to sell.  At this event we will be wearing tshirts & are looking for companies to help sponsor us & in return we will had either their web address or company logo onto the top. Is this something Sainsbury s as a company or at local branch could help us out with at all? Regards;;;;;2016-09-06T09:29:17+0000;1473154157;2016-09-06 11:29:17;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I came into the store at about 8 this morning and was in a right flap! I am not a confident driver by any means and I had to drive to Folkestone from Gillingham for work. After driving round the town getting more and more flustered I saw your store and parked. I was stressed out and  quite frankly  being an idiot and shaking. I spoke to the lady at customer services and she was amazing. She calmed me down and explained the parking charges and told me not to worry about anything. She told me to move my car in my lunch break and as long as I bought something in store the parking would be free.  I came back in my lunch break  bought lunch and she validated my parking whilst checking if I was ok. She was genuinely lovely and helpful. I returned at the end of my shift and saw her again as she was leaving and again she checked how I was and offered her help. She really helped put me at ease today  going above and beyond what was expected of her to do the best for me. She is an asset to your company and deserves a HUGE well done! Thank you Debs.

This is what used to make you better than Tesco. Now the premium sandwiches are priced on their own at £2.50. Maybe you need a  Premium Meal Deal  slightly more than the standard meal deal if you are unable to offer the same as before.   A lot of people in the store were also shocked and commenting on the lack of choice and it seems they are on here too. I think you have made a big mistake. Hope you reconsider.;;;;;2016-09-05T11:46:50+0000;1473076010;2016-09-05 13:46:50;2;0;2;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

The huge advantage Sainsbury s meal deal had over other supermarkets was the fact that all the sandwiches/wraps were included and there was a massive amount of choice.  The Fajita Wrap/Coke/Crisps selection I used to get would cost me £3  amazing value. Now  the same selection would cost me £4.20? That s just not cool.  I d have much rather seen a small price increase to the deal as a whole instead of simply removing the amazing selection you once offered. In Hoylake  there s a Co-op over the road that does a meal deal for £3.25  there s also a Subway that offers a lunch deal for even cheaper. I m just going to go there from now on  they offer a much better selection.;;;;;2016-09-05T11:44:01+0000;1473075841;2016-09-05 13:44:01;3;3;3;0;6;3;1;2;0;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

There was a really helpful staff member on hand to tell me that this had changed today and that there were many confused people.  I don t understand why Sprite as a Coke product cannot be part of the deal?

A very nice chap brought it to my door and proceeded to explain about what has been substituted. Ok so sainsburys own Yorkers instead of aunt Bessie s and a different scent of handwash is fine. But I really wanted to bake some mince pies so what does my mincemeat get substituted with? A bag of sultanas yes a bag of sultanas. Not quite sure how they would taste between pastry but guessing not like mince pies. I also was expecting some panini bread  nope I got a pack of kings ill soft rolls. Not quite the same as a panini. It has made me laugh at the thought of what actually goes through the shoppers mind when picking orders  no offensive but it has to be a man cos a woman would know you can t make mince pies out of sultanas unless I wanted to go the whole hog and make my own mincemeat. So no mince pies for hubby to take to work and no panini and chips for dinner.;;;;;2016-09-04T12:09:38+0000;1472990978;2016-09-04 14:09:38;1;4;1;0;5;4;2;2;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

You blatantly ignore motorists asking you to move whilst you only pick one basket a time and knocked on the door and waited for them to answer... and then proceeded to wait till your customer had emptied the shopping from the basket before you turned and then eventually after 10 mins decieded to move.

So Callan and Ryley had their Meningitis B immunisations today and Callan had hit a pretty hefty 39 temp. I go out to get some kids medicine and energy drinks (tonight is gonna be a long night) so I go to sainsburys get my stuff go through the self serve and the thing comes up to be checked and the guy KNOCKS ME BACK for my Calpol and Nurofen!! So I walk out shocked  go to Scotmid and buy Calpol but no Nurofen  so then I message Andrew and he sends me back the NHS guidance on the issue that clearly says there is NO AGE RESTRICTION on over the counter medicines. So I get pissed off and go back  speak to the guy and he argues with me! So I ask for a manager who comes over and starts to argue to so I go  ARE YOU SAYING YOU RE DENYING A SICK KID MEDICINE?  And she backtracks and long story short gives me my medicine for free. But either way I want to call out this bullshit policy. What if a kid is spiking a temp and is at risk of hitting a temp seizure? And there s nowhere else open  and the KB a mother who s less able to stand up than me and the kid ends up in hospital after the temp could have been easily resolved with some Calpol?

I did advise her that you just need to use the scanning gun rather than the pass over. She told me I didn t know what I was talking about and looked at my phone like it was a weapon of mass destruction. So lost points on a £140 pound shop and made to feel like an imbecile in front of a line of shoppers. So now I am on  Strict Instructions  to take my smartphone to Tesco  where it is never a problem.;;;;;2016-09-03T05:14:07+0000;1472879647;2016-09-03 07:14:07;1;7;1;0;8;7;3;4;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

My partner went into the store to purchase several large pizzas for a treat for his mothers birthday so she wouldn t have to cook last Sunday.  The woman at the counter informed him that they didn t have what he was asking for and told him that she could not go to the shop floor and get more.  I work in the Haringey store. I know for a fact that when our pizza counter needs more stock they take from the shop floor and inform the manager so the stock can be accounted for.  This is not limited to pizza counter I ve seen our other departments do this too.  My question therefor is why did this colleague feel that it was not important to drive sales? Why did she choose not to Make Customers Matter? These are covered in training!;;;;;2016-09-01T15:06:31+0000;1472742391;2016-09-01 17:06:31;0;1;0;0;1

It s school uniform and I was relying on these as they re aged 2  I didn t bother buying any where else since you offered next day delivery - I m now still without uniform And in all stores any type of uniform in age 2 is now SOLD OUT.

My eldest son managed to tip our trolley containing my youngest son on its side and managed to catch his chin in the process. One of the shop attendants was there straight away followed by another 2 lovely members of staff who made sure both of them were OK and gave them a lollipop. I forgot to ask them their names but from a very flustered mum I am very grateful! Needless to say I don t think he ll be standing on the side of a trolley again! Many thanks x;;;;;2016-09-01T14:08:12+0000;1472738892;2016-09-01 16:08:12;14;3;14;0;17;3;2;1;3;0;13;0;0;0;0;0;0

Even though the advertising suggests bags of Walkers crisps are included in the offer  not all flavours are. After waiting in a long queue I was asked for £4.90 for my lunch  as opposed to £3. I had the choice of paying up or going back and choosing a different flavour and rejoining a long queue. I left it and went to Tesco  who are a little less sneaky.;;;;;2016-09-01T09:51:14+0000;1472723474;2016-09-01 11:51:14;1;6;1;0;7;6;4;2;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ve now called three times but heard nothing and just keep getting fobbed off. It would seem the manager of the Hackney store in question doesn t actually want to deal with this. Does anyone looking after this page want to deal with it or does the dashcam footage have to go viral first?;;;;;2016-09-01T08:32:37+0000;1472718757;2016-09-01 10:32:37;2;14;2;1;17;14;4;10;3;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0
