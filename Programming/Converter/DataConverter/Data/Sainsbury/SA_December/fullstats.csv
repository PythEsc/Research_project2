It cost over £5 and was rather small with a really cheap quality roll that fell apart and not much meat. It was over filled with a glurpy sauce. I was not impressed  surely the quality of the bread roll should be good not a nothing little roll that just falls apart ?  Also the main part of the meal was the chips and the coleslaw when I wanted it to be the roll with chips and slaw on the side. Staff were not at all bothered when I handed it back. All they could say was that the roll had been cooked on the premises which to my mind actually makes it worse.;;;;;2016-12-31T18:06:14+0000;1483207574;2016-12-31 19:06:14;0;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0

To the highly paid management - you ve lost a good customer because I cannot and will not be travelling to Amblecote to the middle of a housing estate on two buses to continue to shop with you.  I think your decision stinks and I hope you received my email (in response to the very condescending mailshot email from the store manager stating there would be full deliveries until the end; in fact there have been massive gaps on some shelves for weeks).  I can send it again if you want to know what this very unhappy ex-customer thinks.  Your loss is Asda s gain.";;;;;2016-12-30T19:25:58+0000;1483125958;2016-12-30 20:25:58;3;4;3;0;7;4;3;1;1;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

They fetched her tissues and wipes and a bowl in case she was sick (which she was) and even cleaned it and gave it to us for the car in case it was required on the journey to a&e  as there was a 4 hour wait for an ambulance!

A cashier at the Colton store in Leeds sat and watched me struggle to bag my shopping whilst I was trying to hold my poorly baby. I was trying to get a kettle into a bag that was in fact sealed and therefore wouldn t open. After watching me struggle for a few minutes i asked her to cut the tag from the bag so I could open it. She was looking at me with utter disdain. She didn t speak to me throughout the whole transaction other than to tell me the price and ask for my nectar card.  I don t expect anyone to pack my shopping for me but I don t think it s unreasonable to offer to help if someone is struggling  at the very least not looking at me like I m a massive pain and inconvenience to her would have been nice  she was beyond rude.;;;;;2016-12-28T19:28:23+0000;1482953303;2016-12-28 20:28:23;1;3;1;0;4;3;2;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

People don t just pick random delivery times because they don t really care when it turns up  i pick times which fit in with my day...i have severe health problems and have to fit things around dealing with that. If i don t answer my phone it is because i am either out or am unable to. Today i was out walking my dog  just for ten minutes  but i came back to find that your driver was in such a hurry to knock off early that after getting no answer on the phone he then turned up on our doorstep and rang the bell three times...it is a very loud bell and even the hardest of hearing can hear from outside that it has worked...but he succeeded in waking up my partner who was asleep after working a night shift  who then thinking it was something urgent pulled on his clothes only to find yet again that it was just the sainsbury s delivery man trying to deliver 90 minutes before my chosen delivery time...obviously he accepted the delivery. This is really not acceptable though  and after being a customer of yours for many years i am now so annoyed by this that i really don t know if i should use you again...some of your drivers are lovely  polite and grateful when i accept an early delivery but others are  abrupt and quite clearly just in a rush to get to go home for lunch or finish their shift early  having no respect at all.

The young lady on customer services was brilliant and she called for a manager so it could be investigated.  This was a waste of time  as the so called manager was not in the least bit concerned that someone had hurt them selves on this item.   I was informed if I wanted this to be investigated I had to call the number on the packet and it was not for the store to do this or inform other customers to be careful if they had purchased these items  as it was to remote a possibility for them to be concerned with this incident to happen to anyone else.   I am disgusted with the attitude of your management team a customer got hurt here is a tenner as a good will gesture now go away whilst we throw this item in the bin and forget about it.  I told him to keep the tenner and refund and I would be taking this further  it is the responsibility of you company to concern it self when a customer gets hurt due to a product you sell  it is your responsibility to ensure that all products are fit for purpose  its not for the customer to run around ensuring other customers do not get hurt whilst purchasing products brought in your store which were manufactured on Sainsbury behalf..

I bought into the hype of booking a Christmas delivery slot (3 weeks in advance). One of the items (the main one give it was a Christmas food shop)  was a 3kg UNBASTED turkey Crown. You sent a 6kg BASTED turkey crown. Basted with BUTTER. Not a very clever substitution given that the rest of the shop contained 20 items worth £22.90 of specifically non-dairy (soya based) items. Indicating  one would have thought  that there was at least one person in the household with a dairy intolerance. Luckily a local butcher managed to provide what Sainsbury s couldn t  even though you had 3 weeks notice. Then imagine my  delight  when preparing the veggies for Christmas dinner yesterday to find most of the vegetables delivered by you had use by dates varying from 22nd December to the 24th December.

I just wanted to say a massive thank you for some brilliant customer service I received at your Wadsley Bridge store in Sheffield. I went into your store yesterday in the hope of buying a nut free christmas fruit cake (a new cake I know you ve been selling this year). Unfortunately it was out of stock. I went to find a staff member and he told me that you wouldn t be getting any more stock in now. But he offered me a solution. He said he d call up another shop in the city and see if they had any stock in. Thankfully they did. But he didn t stop there. He then offered to go and speak to a manager who passes by the other store and see if they could pick up this cake for me and bring it to my local store for today. The manager said yes it was no problem. What a lovely thing to do. The staff member who helped me was called Jack and I d love for him to know how grateful I was for such brilliant customer service. Unfortunately I didn t get the managers name but thank you to them too! Absolutely wonderful customer service for an allergy family who can t just buy any regular cake and given the fact that I had left it so late to get one it was entirely my own fault. So please let Jack know what a wonderful job he is doing. Thank you. Liisa;;;;;2016-12-24T23:09:33+0000;1482620973;2016-12-25 00:09:33;3;4;5;0;9;4;2;2;4;0;3;2;0;0;0;0;0

I d like to talk to you about community spirit. Today I went to purchase a Christmas bouquet to decorate my home with in my favourite little local store  I looked at the pretty bouquets and lots of them there were too. But all had expiry of today  so in honesty didn t purchase one. I got chatting to one of your store colleagues and through that conversation he told me that boquets have to be thrown away if they are not sold on the day of display until. They cannot reduce them for the public to buy. Now   seriously.  You throw them away? What about giving them to local elderly homes or people that are sick within the community or maybe even to a customer who looks like they ve had a particularly crap day? So much is wasted in our world already  why don t you turn that waste into cheer? Just an idea.... But a bloody good one if I do say so myself.

The staff weren t rude or unpleasant but there wasn t a very festive feel! To be honest  I m not surprised due to the way some of the shoppers were behaving!

I ve just picked up my Christmas order  and every single item expires on Boxing Day.  With no option to freeze - some of these items were destined for the 29th December.   Over £100 spent  and half of it no good to me.  A huge waste of money.  Please can someone from Customer Services contact me to discuss further?;;;;;2016-12-24T07:18:58+0000;1482563938;2016-12-24 08:18:58;0;10;1;0;11;10;5;5;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

I just want to say your staff at Telford Shropshire store are wonderful! You would not think it was two days to Christmas or that they even noticed any of the chaos because they were just so happy and polite 😊 Also two members of staff went all over the store searching for something I wanted despite me saying it s not that important and not to worry  they went about it anyway and found the next best thing and apologized a ton (even though it was totally not their fault it wasn t in stock 😂) I really do appreciate the effort!  It was crazy in there today but not one member of staff was without a smile and I left feeling very happy and organised so thank you to the Telford team and a very Happy Holidays to you all 🎄🎅🎁;;;;;2016-12-23T21:16:36+0000;1482527796;2016-12-23 22:16:36;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Why can I get points from anywhere but limited to where I can spend them? Surely it all goes back to one point? What if I wanted to purchase something that wasn t at our local store?

I was  devastated! Only been shopping a week before and filling it with Christmas food too. My friend Sue saw my fb status and I said I was going up to sainsburys today to replace what I could  when I got there Ian came too me and gave my boys a gift each and Sue had arranged 15% off my shopping and a nectar points booster. This was totally unexpected and appreciated and saved us a fair bit money. So a huge thank you to sainsburys and I really feel christmassy again.

So I do my usual online shop only to find we can do a maximum of £99.99 in vouchers. Annoying when they come in £50 and £25. So be it  I apply £75 to our shop and all was fine. Until I ve just received an email  the day after the food was delivered  to say the vouchers couldn t be applied and now the total amount is coming out of our bank account. To say I m annoyed would be an understatement. We ve had to go into our limited savings to make sure we don t go overdrawn. I ll be using another supermarket in 2017.

Last October  British Gas recommended Sainsburys Energy as a cheaper tariff as my current tariff was due to end. I contacted SE and received a reply on 18 Oct 2016  to say my energy switch to Sainsburys from British Gas would take 2 weeks. At the beginning of Dec I realised I had heard nothing further from SE so I registered a complaint on SE page and was given a complaint ref. number. I also went onto register the same complaint on British Gas website as they had recommended SE to me. I was surprised to see only a few digits difference between the complaints reference numbers of SE and BG. Then I realised BG and SE are one and the same.  Sainsbury s Energy is a trading name used under licence by British Gas Trading Limited  a Centrica company. Registered in England and Wales No. 3078711 I was told by SE that they had no record of me applying to  change   so I sent them a copy of the email I received from SE in October  and I was told it appeared that the request had been ignored. British Gas are not interested in my problem and have just said to contact SE as it is their fault  even though they are one and the same company and even use the same complaints and computer systems. As a result  BG have put me on the highest tariff possible as my tariff with BG has expired. After an initial response from SE on 7 Dec  I have heard NOTHING  so I am still paying their alter ego British Gas at the highest rate. I have contacted OFGEM  to ask why these so called  white label arrangements   which allow bigger companies such as BG to supply energy to companies who don t hold their own supply licence such as Sainsburys  are allowed at all. Why can t BG offer customers the same rate as their alter ego company? There must be some financial benefit in this for BG  but certainly not for the customer when they wash their hands of any problems encountered by customers in the so called   switch .  I continue to pay BG at the highest rate with no communication from BG or SE since Dec 6 2016. Trading Standards really needs to look at the practices of Big Energy Companies and the scams they appear to be pulling on customers.  It s Trading Standards and OFGEM I will deal with now as I have had enough of Big Business attitudes.;;;;;2016-12-23T09:17:36+0000;1482484656;2016-12-23 10:17:36;1;2;1;0;3;2;1;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Placed an order over a week ago for my christmas shop When I picked it up the bacon lattice turkey breast roast I had ordered had been replaced with a turkey crown with stuffing  at  full 25% more cost. I was told it had been substituted as the item I ordered was sold out days ago. It wasn t sold out when I ordrered it  though. The click and collect van at Upton couldn t credit the cost back to me as I didn t want a turkey crown as I don t want t have to deal with a carcass  so I had to walk into the shop and queue only to be told I had to go back to the van to sort it. I refused and after a short wait it was refunded but then I found that there were NO breast joints available that compared so I ve had to get other meat instead. I was looking forward to that on Christmas day and I m having christmas alone so I thought I could rely on Sainsburys to not screw it up.

When I enquired at the customer services desk if there were any scooters available  Charlotte said they were both in use but she would call over one of their  helping hands  scheme helpers and get them to assist me. Before I know it Cathy was there with a wheelchair and kindly pushed me round whilst I got my shopping.  She was so helpful and passed me items off of the shelves to look at. She even helped me at the till and packed my shopping for me and wheeled me back to customer services.  I cannot thank these ladies enough  they made me feel like no task was too much and went out of their way to help me shop. Plus it meant that I was able to get the rest of my Christmas shopping without having to come back on an even busier day.   I m not sure if I got the name of the scheme correct  so apologies if I have but I just wanted to say what a fantastic idea. It was so nice to for once not feel like an inconvenience because you are disabled and to get the help you need without being rush.   Please pass my thanks on Charlotte and Cathy.

Whilst doing my FAMILY Xmas shopping (spent around £100) with husband to be and my daughter the woman behind the til said she would not sell me Xmas crackers! She said I do not look 25 and  explosives are dangerous.  Considering I am 29 and clearly look old enough and safe enough to purchase crackers for my family I found her judgement to be completely wrong. I have worked in retail for around 15 years so please do not explain the think 25 law to me and tell me it is her discretion. I actually think she was taking to mic and spoke in a VERY patronising tone! I do not carry ID around to buy Xmas crackers! So now I want to inform you that I will be having Xmas dinner with my family with no crackers because I live in a rural location and work full time with a young child I do not have time to go back out again for crackers! I wanted to carry out my big Xmas shop in one trip! Sadly I did not get the ladies name but perhaps you need to re-train your staff. I am reluctant to choose Sainsbury s for shopping again!;;;;;2016-12-22T11:46:48+0000;1482407208;2016-12-22 12:46:48;3;8;4;0;12;8;7;1;11;0;3;0;0;1;0;0;0

Then the customers would have the choice of if they wanted to accept the product or not. Of course the blue bags to save money would be returned back to Sainsburys had the customer not paid for them  but this way it would let your customers know if they were receiving a shopping full of products that were unsuitable and you then not getting complaints!;;;;;2016-12-22T11:29:11+0000;1482406151;2016-12-22 12:29:11;1;6;1;0;7;6;3;3;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

As I spotted the TU sale I had a quick look to see if there was anything worth reporting back to my wife.  I was surprised when looking at the racks to have a member if staff have what can only be described as a temper tantrum in front of me. Clothes were grabbed off rails  thrown to the floor at my feet as a fair amount of  grumbling  accompanied the act. As she explained to a colleague  I m sick of bloody customers not putting stuff back properly .  Roll forward to today. My wife popped in on her way to work and took the chance to have a look. She picked up a pair of trousers on the sale rack  of which there were many pairs and took them to the till. There she was informed they weren t on sale and had  obviously  been put in the wrong place by mistake.  Whilst I can laugh at the irony perhaps someone could tell the staff that it s probable you ll always get lazy customers so best not to get upset and just concentrate on getting your own bit right!;;;;;2016-12-22T09:20:33+0000;1482398433;2016-12-22 10:20:33;0;1;0;0;1

He even made me close my door and wait back inside while he unloaded so I didn t get cold. He then helped me with all the bags (unlike asda delivery men!)

I have commented on your page once before about the excellent service at your Ashford by bybrook store. Recently I had a poor experience whilst queuing at the cafe but decided against posting what had happened. Today I went to the cafe again to purchase a take away cappuccino. There were 7 customers queuing  one store colleague on the till and four colleagues prepping. When I asked if another till could be open I was told no they are prepping. Maybe they then reflected as a minute later they did open a second till. I get that they are busy but there was no evidence of the pace and friendliness that the colleagues in the main store display. Love your store and will continue to shop there just not in the cafe;;;;;2016-12-22T08:17:40+0000;1482394660;2016-12-22 09:17:40;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I called the Customer Care line and spoke to a very helpful  patient agent (annoyingly  I didn t get his name - but he was amazing) who actually took the time to listen to me. He offered to call the store for me and see if there was anything they could do. I figured he d just put me on hold for ages and come back and say nothing could be done. I was stunned when he came back to say he d spoken to someone at the Warrington store and that he had offered to go and check the store for me for all the missing items! He promised me a callback within an hour. Simon Jones at the Warrington store called me back within that time frame and had found almost all the missing things for me! Not only that  but he then found someone to deliver them all (at no extra cost) on their way home! Geoff was the kind driver that brought my Christmas dinner essentials to me at the very end of his shift  when I m sure he d have much preferred to just head straight home. Thank you SO much to all involved for truly outstanding service. All 3 people I dealt with were incredible and deserve recognition. It s so rare nowadays to receive such great service. I still can t quite believe it. It was my first time ordering through Sainsbury s home delivery and  thanks to Simon  Geoff and the guy at Customer Care (might have been Alan?)  I ll definitely be doing it again. Happy Christmas! :);;;;;2016-12-22T07:41:11+0000;1482392471;2016-12-22 08:41:11;1;1;1;0;2;1;1;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I wanted to bring to your attention a story better suited to Halloween than Christmas. I currently live in Hong Kong and wanted to buy two friends a keg of beer each as a long running  traditional  Christmas present. I ordered the Hobgoblin 5L and Old Speckled Hen 5L kegs  as well as two pizzas (Pizza Express Romana Pollo Forza and Pizza Express Romana Diavalo) to top up the order for cheaper delivery (they love pizza and I don t love high delivery charges).   You can only imagine how confused they were when a delivery driver turned up to their house with a 6 pack of Hobgoblin (3L) and a 4 pack of Old Speckled Hen (2L) with a Pizza Express Romana Pollo Forza and some Pizza Express Goats cheese  vegetable concoction.  Picture the scene of how disappointed I was to hear that 75% of my order was  substituted  for other items. Shocked  annoyed and in disbelief that a 5L keg can be replaced by a 4 pack (2L) - surely 3x 4 pack (6L) would have been sensible  giving the customer an extra litre of old speckled hen to enjoy. It was when I noticed the green pizza box that my rage escalated. Whoever took it upon themselves to substitute the Pollo Diavalo with a Dough and Goats cheese platter has clearly never heard the phrase  no meat no meal  - a motto I live by.  I appreciate I am only a mere occasional user of online shopping but I think there needs to be some clarification on the term  substitute  to save Christmas being ruined again in the future.  Thanks;;;;;2016-12-22T05:18:44+0000;1482383924;2016-12-22 06:18:44;2;2;2;0;4

The turkey wasn t carved turkey  it was turkey slices that go in sandwiches  the roast potatoes were not cooked properly  the carrots were cold  the gravy was weak and watery  the stuffing was a small ball that was gone in a mouthful and the sausages were cocktail sausages. Who eats cocktail sausages with a roast dinner? The only decent thing was the Yorkshire puddings and the sprouts. Where was the bacon? That turkey roast dinner was like hospital food. After eating that garbage I was still hungry. A microwave turkey roast dinner is better. At least the turkey is pieces of carved turkey and the microwave version is cheaper.;;;;;2016-12-22T04:33:44+0000;1482381224;2016-12-22 05:33:44;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I tried it and find it not working well. then bring it back to exchange it with other items to your Cromwell road branch  I was most shocked of the low level of the customer service which I have received!! I approached a lady behind the customer service desk who immediately advised me that I can’t return this item because I have used it! I told her that I didn’t used it but I tried it find it inaccurate. she said that no we can return it to you. I have asked to speak to the store manager then she walked down had a briefed her colleague and very clear to me that influenced her so not to return my item. I advised her colleague that I have asked to speak to the manager eventually I have been able to speak to a gentle man who introduced himself as the store manager hi name is Petrik. he advised that he not return the item because it’s been used I have explained that I bought this item only 2 days ago  and find it inaccurate he asked did you speak to your GP?? I told him no he said we will not return it. I have advised him that I have been a regular customer of the store for the past 7 years! and that I found it unfair that I’m treated in such way  he said I can’t return this item!  I advise him that I will take this matter to the head office and simply said that do anything you like.! I find it the manner that I have been treated with its beyond what I can call low and especially that the manager himself say that go and to what you want then walk away its beyond disappointing!! I took my item and went to Fulham branch and I was greeted by a friendly receptionist that was very happy to help me and return the item after I explained that it’s not seems to be accurate.  I find it most disappointing that the customer service lady at Cromwell road didn’t even speak in a good respectful language and I don’t mean that she was rude but she wasn’t trained to handle a customer query. and the fact that she treated this matter as if it’s a challenge or argument for her and she is keen to win it I find it completely unacceptable  the manager ignored completely that I’m a loyal customer that I come every day to the store and I spend in average every date £30.00 for the past 7 years  and he was not even bothered to show respect for a customer and walk away from me. I’m must say that this is was a good and positive in my opinion that I have find that there is a Tesco branch which its only 5 minutes driving from Cromwell road Sainsbury’s which has a massive variety of products and a fantastic customers service  and because of the way I have been treated I will never ever step in Cromwell road Sainsbury’s even if its the only store open in London.  Thanks for taking the time to read my email and I wish you all the best  Kind Regards;;;;;2016-12-21T20:23:18+0000;1482351798;2016-12-21 21:23:18;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Customer Services and indeed the Store Manager were unable to assist with the release of a trolley.  In fairness they did offer to provide change but would have meant a withdrawal from the cashpoint just so I could shop in the store. I was told the store does operate a coined trolly system and there were no tokens available.  Having no alternative but to shop in another supermarket  I chose Morrisons in Buxton where I spent over £100.   I realise this won t put a dent in Sainsburys  annual profits  but poor customer service in my view.

We have had to settle with a decorate your own one from Morrisons! My 6 year old is thoroughly unimpressed that there will be no baking or opportunity to really personalise by adding extra doors or whatever you like before the house is baked. On closer inspection of the Christmas section of the baking isle I have to say it was a little lacklustre and I overheard 2 other ladies commenting on the amount of Happy Birthday bits and lack of Christmas decorations so clearly I m not the only one.

Firstly we found out our nectar card was not exclusively ours and all our points we had collected were in fact going to another man who had spent them. Nectars response was have another one on a zero balance and start again... Reluctantly started again collected points in store over the remaining months of the year to use at Christmas. Went to the till yesterday with the points in order to redeem them only to be told the card wasn t registering and we could only add the points from our shop. Customer services response in store was when you next shop here (we don t shop in Sainsburys anymore specially went to spend our points) you can use your points on your shopping and they also told us that the till worker should have called them over  they would have saved the transaction then called nectar and it could have been resolved  so now Sainsburys are also not training their till staff properly! I can t believe nectar and Sainsburys are so non plused about nectar espically with the Incident of the other person using our card  these points have monitory value!  And home delivery  one of the hotest days in summer I was 35 weeks pregnant  delivery driver turns up on my door and dumps the crates on my door step  no help carrying them in and stood there whilst I struggled heavily pregnant moving our £100 worth of shopping into the kitchen. No offer of help once  I get its hot and he most likely couldn t be bothered with the amount of drops he had to do but bending over and up again numerous times to bring my shopping in at 35 weeks pregnant was not fun! And funnily enough I was hot too!! Not happy Sainsburys outraged and disappointed by your service this year! Won t be shopping with you again online or in store! #BBCWatchdog;;;;;2016-12-21T14:59:42+0000;1482332382;2016-12-21 15:59:42;0;12;0;0;12;12;2;10;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Despite having photographic ID with my date of birth on it  I was refused. I am in there almost every day spending a fortune and they know me. But that didn t matter. It may or may not have something to do with the fact I mystery shopped them a few weeks ago. Who knows. But that is irrelevant. I am a paying customer  who was sober and had proper ID.

Orders should not be taken  if they cannot be fulfilled.  This is the first time I ve looked at your own website and it s obvious Im not the only customer you have let down this Christmas .      Judging by the amount of customers you have upset over the past few days with this issue I ll be surprised if they continue shopping with you as I certainly will be moving elsewhere.  No point being loyal to a brand that has no interest in customer relation.   You may be having an extremely busy Christmas period but you still have January onwards and I m sure and hope your footfall and online sales  will drop as customers you have dealt with this badly will not return and judging by your Facebook page there are a lot of  people from Aberdeen and all over the country not getting a turkey with their online shop . Maybe one if your staff could nip to Waitrose or Morrisons or Marks and Spencer and but enough to use for  your own orders !!  Shamefully treatment of customers and to tell me I can have a refund in 3 to 5 days and have a nice evening is taking the  P .  In capital letters !!!!!!!

I ve now been told no chance of a turkey unless I go out and find one myself  and I can have a refund on my shop in 3 to 5 days and have a nice evening...That about says it all  happy to take your money all year but no real interest in customers.     You would think Sainsbury s were interesting in hanging on to long term customers but obviously have no interest in us at all.      Hope when customers are slim pickings after   Christmas they have time to mull over their shortcomings.     The reason for my comments here are copied below.

I loved the silver penguin design however when wrapping my gifts I found the quality of the paper terrible it is see through and tears very easily .... I m very disappointed .

She deserves praise for going out of her way to help me.  After receiving the Christmas order catelogue through the door in November   my 2 year old son and husband did some some  cutting and sticking  using the pictures and made a picture of what they would like for Christmas from Father Christmas! Among other things  my son had chosen the  polar bear cake  and my husband the  Limoncello Buche De Noel  .  I didn t realise these were Christmas order only products and had been repeatedly checking in store and on the normal online section. My son kept on saying how much he wanted the cake and didn t seem to forget about it.  In desperation  I went to customer service last week. Lynn Jordan  explained about the Xmas ordering ..... but I had missed the last date!  She explained that sometimes surplus come in store and she would check for me.  Today  she phoned me saying she had successfully got for them for me! She also explained that she had asked her husband to look in the store he works in AND had even discussed with one of the bakers in store about making me an equivalent if need be!  This was exemplary service.  As a consequence of her help   I will have a happy 2 year old and husband on Christmas day.  In addition  she have me a voucher for quadruple nectar points.  A HUGE thank you to get. I hope she received this message and that management recognise her brilliant service to me.;;;;;2016-12-20T20:08:12+0000;1482264492;2016-12-20 21:08:12;8;2;8;0;10;2;1;1;1;0;8;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was attempting to achieve a refund of £3.55 for a (child s) magazine purchased in error. Apparently  as I bought said magazine 9 days ago   we can t resell it . I was tempted to explain that I wasn t returning a rotten / putrefying f***ing cabbage  but thought the better of it. A supervisor was then summoned  but took about 15 minutes to appear. Said supervisor felt the need to seek higher authority  and tried to phone the deity..... no reply  so  I ll need to go and find someone . I gave up at this stage. Never again !!;;;;;2016-12-20T13:18:35+0000;1482239915;2016-12-20 14:18:35;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Today at about 3.30 in our local branch (Cotgrave) my 6 year old daughter was sick whilst in the que. another member of the public informed your staff and they said they would be right with us. I didn t want to leave it for anyone else to clean up or step in it. 20 minutes it took and multiple comments off members of the public to your staff before someone came to help us. She was clearly distressed and embarrassed by what had happened and was left for everyone to see. And then when someone finally did come they had no compassion towards us at all. The only member of staff in that store that showed any customer service to us was a new member of staff who as I am aware has only been with you for a week. They were more bothered about getting the que down which in all honesty never goes down quickly than dealing with a issue which carries a health hazard. Yes I know it is only a job in a shop and you don t expect to be dealing with these things but you are meant to employ staff with customer skills not 1 person who helped us today had any of these. I for one will not be using that branch again until I know your staff carry the basic skills it takes to be a customer retail assistant.;;;;;2016-12-19T20:16:49+0000;1482178609;2016-12-19 21:16:49;3;1;3;0;4;1;1;0;0;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

Please could you look into how we are to redeem the discount of 20% off our shopping at Sainsburys which is offered with the SIU security industry united card.  My partner and I did our Christmas shop in your Salisbury store today  as he has this union member card offering a discount and also has another discount card from his employer which is ment to have the same benefit. The cashier did not know of either of them and called her supervisor who claimed that they weren t accepted  but it s still showing as a discount on the cards sites. We just had to pay up the undiscounted price and thought I d ask you here as they are clearly swamped in store with the rush and didn t know  rather than inconveniencing everyone else in the queue and the staff by trying to get it sorted then and there. If someone could get back to me about this when you have a spare few minutes that would be great.

On Friday we came in early for breakfast with our 3 day old baby.  It was my husbands birthday too. While my husband was ordering food he was telling the lady as she was asking about the little one. He also told her it is my birthday on the 19th. .... A busy month!! As we were eating our breakfast two members of staff approached and presented us with a food hamper to say congratulations and happy birthday to both of us.  Was a lovely thought and nice surprise!

I bought  from your Pontllanfraith (South Wales) store  a piece of ham to boil. I incorrectly bought smoked ham  instead of normal non smoked ham. Upon returning home and putting my shopping away I realised my error  and returned straight back to the store with my receipt and the piece of ham  hoping to exchange it for a non smoked piece of ham  only to be told by a member of staff that there is a 20 minute return policy on fresh foods  and as I was slightly over that timescale  I was unable to make an exchange - leaving me with a £7+ piece of ham that will now go to waste. It wasn t as if I was trying to return the ham days later  I was just outside your alleged exchange timescale  and although I then looked in store  I was unable to find this policy displayed anywhere!!

This given  unfortunately on this occasion we come to you not with praise though instead with displeasure in the quality of one of your products. As Australians with a fondness for a good snag from the barby we expectedly find the group craving a quality sausage in a bun on the regular occasion  sadly your Sainsbury s Butchers Choice Pork Sausages do not seem to meet our expectations. The meat has a heavily processed taste and a soft rubber like texture once cooked which is not comparable with other higher quality sausages found on the common market. As a group  we would like to suggest the Sainsbury s butcher section considers updating this product to meet a higher standard of taste and finish.  Please take our suggestions into consideration and proceed as you see best fit Kind regards A bunch of snag loving Aussies.";;;;;2016-12-16T18:27:15+0000;1481912835;2016-12-16 19:27:15;3;1;3;0;4;1;1;0;1;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

My husband put in £10 worth of petrol and I went into the petrol station to pay. I went to this blond hair lady and said: “Pump 2 please”  She didn’t make any eye contact nor say anything and she even shake her head. After 10-15 seconds I saw my husband about to put the petrol nozzle back to the machine so I said to her again: pump 2 please as I thought she might not heard me at the first time. Then she used extremely unpleasant tone of voice told me: “Yeah! I can’t do anything because I have to wait for him to finish”. I answered her: “Yes  I understand that and I am just telling you it’s pump 2. You don’t have to gave me attitude about that” then she said: “I have bad attitude?! You have attitude first.”  I said: How could i have bad attitude? I saw you shake your head first! Then she said: I didn’t shake my head  how do you know? What if I have a twitch?! In the end  I was so angry so I storm out of the petrol station and took this photo on the car as I didn’t have chance to saw her name on her name tag.   I immediately went to the store and made the official complained to the Manager Sharon. She told me there is going to be an official investigation but she can’t let me know what’s the further development of this investigation due to the confidential policy. But I just need to let your company know we will not use any Sainsbury’s service anymore even if that’s the only petrol station in the area. I would sooner run out of petrol and call the AA for assistance or even better visit one of your friendlier competitors Tesco or Shell.  I would sooner shell out (pun is intentional) on more expensive petrol from elsewhere than experience your appalling customer service again.  If your company and branch (Craigleith Edinburgh) do something about this  that’s great. If not then you have lost both myself and my husband as customers and I’m recommending all of my friends  colleagues and associates shop elsewhere.

Disgusted that you re selling something that s a hazard to children  luckily my daughter was only in the back of the car and not napping in her bedroom where it could have been a lot more serious!!;;;;;2016-12-15T23:23:17+0000;1481844197;2016-12-16 00:23:17;0;8;1;0;9;8;5;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

I have a Filter Coffee Maker  one of your own brand models  and I ve had a mishap with a part of it.  It s designed with a safety valve that pops into action if I lift the jug off the maker  and unfortunately the valve has fallen out whilst I was washing up.  I ve tried popping the valve back in  but the spring isn t functioning correctly  and  in  the valve no longer works.  Now  clearly the machine still works but in an ideal situation I need to get that safety valve sorted out.  Any ideas  please?;;;;;2016-12-15T20:56:53+0000;1481835413;2016-12-15 21:56:53;1;13;1;0;14;13;1;12;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

After arriving at 11.45 and being told they had already  sold out  of ham egg and chips (my guess is they didnt have any to start with) we chose a brunch and Christmas dinner. After waiting over half an hour (being told there was a 20 min wait) the food arrived. The xmas dinner was mostly cold and the veg was practically raw. My brunch was nice apart from the black sausage and slight lack of mushrooms...I eventually found them...two teeny weeny shrivelled ones! I would have complained at the time but it was so busy myself and my nan didn t want to add to the complaints as a few others had also complained about missing orders and wrong orders! On a plus side the chips were lovely and my nan said her roast potatos were the best bit of her meal too!  Needless to say I think we will be giving sainsburys cafe a miss for a while!

An employer has the right  whether or not it is explicitly reflected in the employment contract  to require a worker to work on a public holiday. It is common in industries such as retail or emergency services. We have also heard from hon. Members about other sectors such as hospitality  sport and leisure. Employers can determine when workers take their leave—for example  to cover an annual shutdown at work—and can refuse to give leave at a certain time  but they must give workers the opportunity to take their leave at some point during the leave year. The entitlement should give all workers sufficient time to see their families over the year  although I accept that Christmas and various other times of the year are absolutely associated with spending time with family.  In addition  there are special provisions for shop workers who do not wish to work on Sundays  at least. All shop and betting shop workers can opt out of Sunday working  unless Sunday is the only day they have been employed to work. A shop worker can opt out of Sunday working  even if they agreed in their contract to work on Sundays  by giving three months’ notice.;;;;;2016-12-15T10:25:31+0000;1481797531;2016-12-15 11:25:31;0;1;0;0;1

Didn t hear anything so was looking forward to it all arriving.

Delivery driver was suprised no one had phoned to tell me 66% of my order would not be delivered!!!  Hadn t had a sainsburys order before so asked driver about price promise on substitutions.

Turns out he was wrong and i could have kept those drinks at the price I d ordered.  So spent my evening chasing round for haribo and drinks that sainsburys should have let me know weren t coming. If I d have known 66% of the order wasn t coming I d have told you no to bother.  Very dissapointed. Wont be shopping online with sainsburys again.;;;;;2016-12-14T19:16:00+0000;1481742960;2016-12-14 20:16:00;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

So I bought two Christmas presents online 4/12/16. Today I decided to call and see where said items are? A very unhelpful man on the phone informed me that both items were out of stock and cancelled at the warehouse! When exactly was I going to be advised? Rather annoyed that I hadn t been told this was the case  the call was ended. On reflection I thought I am sure my account had been debited so I checked and indeed it had on the 8/12/16 surely you would check stock levels before accepting an order and taking payment?? So again I call to be met with another even less helpful man who when asked why I was charged for an order that was never going to be fulfilled - his answer was it s the busiest time of year we can t contact everyone! Really not my problem there should be systems in place to ensure this is avoided! His whole attitude was poor and there was no apology and now I have to source replacement gifts while waiting a week to get my money back when it should have never been taken! One very unhappy and disappointed customer who won t be rushing back to Sainsburys anytime soon!;;;;;2016-12-12T22:09:49+0000;1481580589;2016-12-12 23:09:49;0;6;0;0;6;6;2;4;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have been a pretty loyal Sainsbury s shopper this year  and a good girl  but I m feeling a little shafted. I m aware that there was a change to the way Nectar points function  but am more than a little crushed to discover that my roughly £4 000 of spending at Sainsbury s has amounted to precisely £20.48 in Nectar points. I ve shopped there nearly every week for a whole year and for my loyalty I can t even afford to buy one weeks  shopping! A competing supermarket (thou who shalt not be named)  who have received far less of our business  have given us over £50 worth of spending. Surely I can t be the only one who feels their loyalty is not exactly being rewarded?! I m coeliac so my food costs a lot more every week than most people s and we rely on points to help pay for our Christmas shop. Now I will struggle to buy my favourite cheeses from you as well as crackers and bread to go with them. What will we do without our cheeses?! *sob*   Quietly sobbing in the corner   Vikki Cook;;;;;2016-12-12T21:42:15+0000;1481578935;2016-12-12 22:42:15;1;8;1;0;9;8;3;5;4;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have just checked product reviews on your website and most of the recent ones give a one star rating. Comments include  Bitter.

I placed an order to click and collect at my store in Shrewsbury on 30th November which I find out tonight was delivered to Blackheath. The only option your customer service gave me was to go to Blackheath to collect myself or have a refund as you don t send orders between stores. It is too far to go myself and frankly I don t see why I should make the journey when it s your mistake. All but 1 of the items I ordered are now out of stock  well  actually they re not as they re sitting in Blackheath store  but you re unwilling to sort your own mistake out. You d think you d make the effort to get orders to people  especially at this time of year. Very disappointed and won t be buying from you online again.

Last week in your Tonbridge  Kent  store I wanted to buy a box of frozen Ham Hocks  usually I can reach them  but found they had been moved to the top shelf of the freezer cabinet.  The freezer cabinet was situated above a freezer which made it even more difficult to reach the item I wanted!  My usual remedy in this situation is to grab the nearest long package I can see and then use it to edge the item I want off the shelf.  But no - you have grown wise to this and I found there is now a 1inch high plastic strip along the edge of the shelf  which means the box of Ham Hocks had to be lifted up over this strip to get them off the shelf!  Is this a ploy to get older people to exercise more I wonder?  If so  you would have been proud of me  I stretched & stretched until I could stretch no more  and managed to get the item I wanted off the shelf!  Sadly  in the process I have torn or pulled muscles in my upper arm and shoulder and have been in agony ever since!  I have mentioned/complained about the positioning of some items before.  Both on-line and in store.  The in store explanation was that all store layouts are designed by computer.  I would like to point out that computers don t actually go shopping - so how would they know the best place to put an item for a human to buy it?  No  all computer programmes do is to show you the best way to cram as much as you can into your stores!  About time the person who designs the computer programmes stopped and thought a bit and realised that not all customers are young  fit and 6 feet tall!  I know you will tell me that I should go and find a  colleague  if I can t access something.  Well I resent this!  Yes - I am verging on elderly but I am fit and able (or was until last week).  Why should I need to add time to my weekly shop running back & forth to ask someone to get things of the shelves for me?  You may assume I am not happy - and you would be right!  So back to my original question:  Why do you issue your staff with round metal steps to stand on when stacking items on higher shelves  but then expect your customers to be gymnasts if they want to buy said items?;;;;;2016-12-12T19:23:46+0000;1481570626;2016-12-12 20:23:46;1;1;2;0;3;1;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;1;0;0;0

Thanks all no need to share anymore.  Henry and I broke down on the m5 today about 11.50am it was pouring rain and no where at the side of the road to safety wait as we couldn t get behind the safety barrier. About 10 mins went past Henry and I getting very wet and Henry crying and finally a SAINSBURYS LORRY pulled up on the hard shoulder to check if I was ok. At this point Henry has had a nappy explosion to top all things off  straight through his clothes and into the car seat. Craig Marshall was the lorry driver he cleared his cab and took me and Henry to the lorry so I could change Henry in the dry. He handed Henry up to me and then carefully took him off me so Henry was safe. He even said he would dispose of the poopy clothes and nappy which were in two nappy sacks!! He then helped me move my pram to a safer distance from my car  and finally he waited 45 mins in the pouring rain with Henry and I until a traffic officer arrived and the breakdown truck.  MY HERO who went above and beyond to help me. He works for NFT Bristol and they guy deserves such recognition from his company and Sainsbury s  Thank you Craig for restoring my faith in others and for such a kind act that made such a huge difference to me and my 19 week old baby boy. Henry and I got home at about 6 my car is still poorly though  Please share  I will try to track down the company and will write to Sainsbury s too.

I m yet to tell my 8 year old that  NO  Sainsburys don t have any safe cereals for you any more...would the person who made this decision like to contact her and tell her personally.;;;;;2016-12-12T12:51:45+0000;1481547105;2016-12-12 13:51:45;0;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0

Last Christmas I was searching everywhere for your Whiptop Parvé vegan squirty cream but could not find it anywhere. I live in Hertfordshire and I m willing to travel anywhere to get my hands on it as I am missing out on many a yummy dairy and gluten free pudding if I cannot have it in my fridge for the big day. My local sainsburys were unable to order it in for me and this year I have tried ordering it online as it said it was available... however at the last hurdle it told me it was not available in my area and it made me very sad. I have heard rumours that the illusive cream is at the London Colney store? If so  I will go there on Wednesday and buy as many as I possibly can.   If you could please let me know which of your stores stock this product I will be incredibly grateful 💖   Much love 💖;;;;;2016-12-12T12:21:53+0000;1481545313;2016-12-12 13:21:53;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I know that the beaters are pretty much one size fits all as I have borrowed beaters from friends before and they all have fit my mixer. We live in such a throw away society and I am appalled that I have to buy a whole new machine just for a replacement beater when the actual machine works fine itself!;;;;;2016-12-12T11:59:03+0000;1481543943;2016-12-12 12:59:03;0;5;0;0;5;5;2;3;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ve spent 20 mins on the phone with customer services.  I now have to wait 3-5 working days as my parcel was delivered to the wrong store.  I have been advised to re-order the products and you  should  be able to honour my home delivery if the items are still in stock after my refund has gone back in.  My other option is to drive 1 1/2 hours to go to this other store to pick my parcel up.  Totalling this experience to 5 working days  2 hours and 50 mins.  All of the products I had purchased were gifts for my children  money is tight and I will need to wait for the money to go back into my account before I can purchase them again not your problem apparently.

Hope you can pass on 😀 he s a great ambassador for you 😀;;;;;2016-12-08T10:14:26+0000;1481192066;2016-12-08 11:14:26;11;2;11;1;14;2;2;0;1;0;11;0;0;0;0;0;0

I feel sick - never heard of this most stores like tescos you can park with no problem and I ve parked at other sains in hoddesdon and Hertford and you pay for a ticket that can be redeemed and is free after 8pm!  I broke down on the said date and waited for someone to jump start my car never in my wildest dreams did I expect a store that I sadly have stayed loyal to worked for snd praised   There s no visible signage that you park here and risk being fined really really disgusting what a lovely intro into festive season!;;;;;2016-12-08T07:29:17+0000;1481182157;2016-12-08 08:29:17;0;25;3;0;28;25;7;18;16;0;0;0;0;0;0;3;0

Our eldest daughter LOVES to go to the Sainsburys cafe and look around the store after especially the toy section. She is autistic and Sainsburys is one of the very few places that we can go as a family and relax because she is happy there. Today we went for our usual visit straight to the cafe. I went ahead with out other daughter after we had finished to look at the clothing section and my husband followed with B not long after. She bacame extremely distressed and had her fingers in her ears and fell to the floor and wouldn t move. So the first thing we thought was to get her off the floor put her in the trolley where she lay down with her coat over her head. She was relaxed so we left her. We were then approached by a member of staff who said we weren t allowed to have our child in the front of the trolley because they d had kids who had head injuries after falling from the trolleys. I said she has autism and needed to calm because the music was really loud. You don t usually play music?? To which he laughed and said we do at christmas. I then said why does it have to be so loud? He walked off obviously cheesed off with me talking back to him! I understand health and safety but I m pretty sure it would be my fault if she fell and hurt herself. Your colleague s attitude about my daughter s asd was appalling! He never even offered to turn it down for us. We left promptly without any purchases and wont be returning if/until we know when the music is being toned down or off altogether. Plus I think your staff need training in equality and diversity!!!;;;;;2016-12-07T21:18:15+0000;1481145495;2016-12-07 22:18:15;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Order appears to go through successfully right down to the last page saying they don t need your verified by visa extra security for this transaction. Then as you wait in the next day for your order to arrive you suddenly have that sinking feeling  and when you check your emails the confirmation email is not there.   Now order cannot be delivered (or collected) until tomorrow when delivery charge changes from £2 to £5.   What makes me even more angry is the poor response by Sainsburys to this issue. Today I was told to use a different device (which I don t have) or ring sainsburys every time I want to checkout online.   Last month I tried to order online  again the process went smoothly according to my screen right to checkout  unfortunately my son was rushed to hospital the morning I was due to click and collect. I rang Sainsburys from A&E and after confirming my details apologised for not being able to click and collect. Obviously I wasn t in the clearest of mental states but the operator definitely did not say anything about there being no order to collect! They just agreed to cancel my order as I couldn t commit to a new delivery slot.   Now while I didn t expect my order to magically arrive at my house as I have heard about with other supermarkets in cases of emergency  I did expect a certain level of customer service.   I have been loyal to Sainsburys since well before iPads  nectar points and the arrival of budget competitors  but sadly I feel this is the end of our  special relationship  and I shall be looking elsewhere for my groceries. Easier and cheaper than buying a new device that is  compatible .   I have been assured it is not just my iPad but all of them. I would be interested to hear other people s experiences.

Order arrived at the time requested on Sunday and after the driver left it became apparent that a large number of items were not delivered as the were supposed to be. I immediately the number on the top of he order explained the problem and was then forced to listen to 10 minutes of god-awful hold music whilst the query was investigated.   At the end of this I was told that there was no manager in to be able to contact the driver and find out what had happened. I don t know why only managers can contact drivers.   I asked when I d be getting my goods and was put back on hold for another 10 minutes.   A the end of this I was told the manager would be back soon and would call me then  or failing that would call me back the next morning.   No call that evening or the next morning so I called and went through the same scenario with the help line again. No record seemingly kept of my previous call despite logging it against my delivery reference number.   I was then told the delivery would now be between 1900 and 2100 the following day (today) but that someone would call the next morning to ensure this was still okay with us.   We received no call today and it s now 21:20 and there s still no sign of the delivery.  Not good enough.

I have been told a jumper that was in stock a when i ordered and paid for it is now not available. I ordered on the 30th November and have only just got an email about my order. This isnt good enough at all.  Me: No response? So its acceptable for Sainsbury s to contact me late at night but not to respond when I do? I will be speaking to trading standards in the morning. You have taken funds from my account  withheld them for 5 days on an order that was shown to be in stock  available and secured by myself at the time of payment.  now five days later to be told this item is no longer available and it will be another 3-5 working days before this money is returned to my account? Who do you think you are Sainsbury s??  S: Sorry Jannine  we are extremely busy. Can you confirm what the item was please? Steven  S: Thank you  we ll look into this for you and be back in touch as soon as possible.  S: Hello  the website stock updates each night with the latest stock numbers. The order appears to have been placed before this had happened. The out of stock notification is then generated when the order is being dispatched. The refund has been processed on the 5th  this can take 3-5 working days to appear back in your account. I m sorry if this has caused any inconvenience  if you need any further help please call us on 0800 028 6658. Maclaine  Me: Its not inconvenient  its miss- selling of goods to take payment for an item that is not available- because you have a  system  that updates its stock levels at night. Its misleading to customers and  an underhanded way of conducting business. You have had my funds in your account for the past 6 days and likely to be up to 12 days. This is money that pooled with other funds would be providing Sainsbury s a profit ( no matter how small..its still a profit) . Why should I as a customer be miss-sold an item  made to wait 5 day before i am told its now not available and then up to a possible 12 days from point of initial sale to me receiving MY money back??  You answer me that! How does Sainsburys intend to compensate me for this ?;;;;;2016-12-06T18:17:03+0000;1481048223;2016-12-06 19:17:03;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0

To Sainsbury s    I have refrained for one week from writing this  firstly to give you chance to rectify your wrongs yourself without social media doing it for you and secondly as I don t really want my business plastered all over the internet. However as you clearly don t give a damn what you have done to me I m willing now to share my story with others!   On Tuesday 29th November I entered your Biggleswade store carrying a pack of faulty Christmas lights that I needed to return. I purchased these when you had your nectar double up event. Sadly I couldn t find my receipt  however I could find the double up receipt you gave me and a bank transaction where I paid for the remainder on my card.   On entering the store I was well aware that I probably wouldn t get my money back as I didn t have my original receipt so I did a small amount of shopping which I thought I could exchange with.   I then went to customer services and explained my situation. I explained i had my double up receipt showing date and time of my original transaction  plus paid by card etc etc and could they do a search to find my purchase. The answer was yes but not now as there was no one in to do it. So I asked if I could return and either exchange or have put on a gift card  it was explained they were now in the sale £8 less then I paid but said it was fine as I didn t want to come over again to take them back. I was then told to wait whilst she found a managed to authorise.   Whilst waiting for 20 minutes for her to return the charming customer services assistant came back armed with security! Who may I add was absolutely charming not!   It was then explained to me that I couldn t return the lights as they had viewed cctv and they had seen me clearly walk in the store without them! I said are you calling me a thief Are you saying I stole those lights to which they replied yes! I was then told by customer services that this is store policy! To check everyone who wants a return without a receipt on cctv! Biggest load of lies I think I ve ever heard! I then started to get angry and did raise my voice  to which then the security told me several times  stop shouting you are the one that stole the lights  please bear in mind this in from of a packed store of shoppers who by this point where all stopping to stare at me whilst I sobbed my heart out through pure embarrassment  anger and humiliation. I then asked for the police to be called as no one else was listening to me which they replied if that s what you want we will  I also asked to view the cctv and was told they didn t have to show me it!    By this point two managers were now surrounding me as well but they at least used their common sense and took me to the warehouse away from a store load of people staring at me!   My bank card was then taken by a member of staff so they could find my original transaction  you know that transaction they had told they couldn t do about 15 minutes previously because there was no staff  yes that one!   I was then taken to a managers office where after about another 15 minutes a very sheepish manager appeared and told me that he saw me very clearly walking in the with the lights! No way! Your joking! What the lights I ve just been accused of stealing  those lights!   As soon as I was cleared of theft and released from the store I rang complained immediately to customer services  who apparently wrote down everything I said and said due to the severity it had to go straight to the executives office for an investigation.   That day I waited and waited for them to call to listen to my full story nothing! So i called next day to be told it s being dealt with  i asked what notes had been written and it was basically  lady for accused of stealing lights  missed quite a lot out of the story there! I demanded to speak to the person dealing with it  I spoke to them explained all of the above and was told he would be in contact by today! Surprise surprise nothing! Nothing at all! I am disgusted! Disgusted that I was treated so badly  disgusted I was accused of something I didn t do for no reason at all  disgusted I was lied to on several occasions and disgusted you couldn t even call back within one week!   Sainsbury s you are a complete joke! I have taken legal advice I do have a strong case for defamation and I will take this further if I need to!;;;;;2016-12-06T17:09:28+0000;1481044168;2016-12-06 18:09:28;1;14;12;10;36

I have a very active 10 year old son  anything sporty and he does it. If I told him sitting on the roof was a sport he would want to do it. Anyhoo he has been making smoothies at school so asked if we could have then at home. We went to our local Sainsbury s and not only bought fruit for said smoothies but also a smoothie maker (it does help having one ha ha). After a hectic weekend my son asked if I would make him one for home time.  So today I have eagerly unpacked the smoothy maker and washed all the components  all washed dried and ready to go. I peel the banana with anticipation  add a splash of orange juice  now time for the strawberries I peel back the lid of those juicy little gems to find them mouldy  a use by date of 10th Dec and they have gone. I think I m going to have a unhappy boy as a banana and orange juice smoothy isn t exactly what he had in mind;;;;;2016-12-06T12:45:12+0000;1481028312;2016-12-06 13:45:12;0;4;0;0;4;4;1;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Delivery arrived and the delivery guy was great. Had the oven on ready to cook the gammon joint... Then saw the use by date was 5/12!!! Called up Customer Services who agreed that it is illegal to sell out of date food-health hazard etc... And offered me a £20 voucher to compensate and a refund of the £10 spent...  I explained again I had 5 people expecting lunch today and the whole lunch party was now going to have to be exported to a local pub... So I was offered £30 voucher...?  Finally after what seemed like an eternity on hold I was told that the Supervisors highest offer is £80 in vouchers (including the £10 cost of the gammon joint). Email vouchers have been received 1 x £50 and 1 x £30... Emails make no reference of an apology... And I am feeling TOTALLY deflated that all my planning for this lunch party has now gone out of the window... Family travelling from all parts of the U.K. for a pre Xmas lunch as we won t be together for Xmas  and now we have to go out to eat so it won t be the personal  intimate lunch we had all hoped for...

After insuring my dogs with you for a while now I am disappointed with your attitude and your policy for exclusions. I will now be looking for a new insurer that actually has some common sense. I made a claim for gastroenteritis for my 8 year old dog when she had to spend a weekend at the emergency vets. You did pay for the claim for which I am grateful. However  you have since placed an exclusion on her policy for all mouth and oral conditions nothing related to what I claimed for. The reason being that when you got the history from my vet to pay the claim it mentioned that during an annual health check they found discolouration on her teeth and I hadn t told you. This discolouration was on a 8 year old dog. This discolouration was so insignificant that it did not require treatment  has never required treatment and after changing her diet has gone. Today your resolution advisor tried to justify your decision by saying that it would be like my dog being diagnosed as having cancer and if I didn t get it treated or tell you that then if I wanted to claim I wouldn t be covered. How is a passing comment by the vet during a routine check (I never took her to the vets because she had bad teeth) that my dog had discoloured teeth anything like some poor person not telling you their dog had cancer?;;;;;2016-12-06T10:09:02+0000;1481018942;2016-12-06 11:09:02;0;5;0;0;5;5;4;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Christmas is a time for giving  receiving and communicating with friends and family. I know this because I just saw one of your drivers communicating on his mobile phone whilst driving around 60 miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour zone in Swindon. Clearly his convo couldn t wait despite the fact he was driving an articulated lorry.   I have the registration of the vehicle but don t want to be responsible for loosing people their jobs just before Christmas. I trust you will send a stern memo to all vehicle drivers warning them that people are always watching.   Here s to a Merry Christmas and as your advertisement advises  the greatest gift we can give this year is ourselves. Perhaps you could remind your employees of this message before they kill themself in a HGV  or worse  somebody else.

Especially as the majority of clothing retailers end their range at age 12 or 13 (sounds familiar Sainsburys?) and don t resume it again until men s wear. Most stores are hugely biased towards girls ranges (and women s tbh) but I ve usually found yours to be  slightly  more evenly matched. Plus the colours tend to be brighter rather than the normal greys and blacks. However  this gap in age range is incredibly difficult. Now two of my sons are in age 14 clothing  there is literally NOWHERE that caters for them. Step in  men s XS size at Sainsburys! The tees are excellent  super soft and mostly without tags (perfect for my fussiest guy) and everything is good quality and reasonably priced. HOWEVER  not all the range is produced in XS. All I need to buy for christmas are two cosy dressing gowns  preferably NOT in dark blue  for two teenage boys. I have scoured the Internet and high street  found nothing! Surely a store  SOMEWHERE  must notice the existence of boys? After all  there are more born every year than girls!;;;;;2016-12-05T14:47:55+0000;1480949275;2016-12-05 15:47:55;1;2;1;0;3;2;2;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I regularly buy from Sainsburys both in store and online  however I come to you today as I am unhappy with my online shopping order. The sale by dates are unsatisfactory as most of them are far too short.   I have spoken to someone over the telephone today and initially I was told I would be refunded for the items  however I was then told that I would not. I think it is quite unfair and I do want a refund for these items that have gone off; I have had to throw items away so I have lost out on money.   My order number is:  153505883.

Out of stock were 4 easy carve quails/ Taste the Difference Easy carve pheasant / Taste the Difference Panna Cotta and Christmas Cake cube selection. It is 4th December today and there is supposed to be 11 more days for Customer s to place their orders so how on earth can you be out of stock already? It is totally unacceptable.

My 6 year old daughter has more kindness and compassion (and common sense) than some of your staff. My husband and daughter were waiting to pay at Sainsbury s for their fuel when an elderly gentleman in front of them was extremely stressed and worried as he had gone over on his fuel purchase by 13p and didn t have any other cash or means to pay the extra 13p. The staff were standing their ground and insisting the man (who was apparently quite upset and confused) fill out a form so that they could  peruse payment  from him..... For 13p! So  my 6 year old daughter who had her pocket money with her went and gave the man 20p. Shame on you Sainsbury s! However  on the flip side  it was very reassuring as parents to know that what we are teaching our daughter about kindness and thinking of others clearly means something to her. It s a shame the world we live in does not reflect these values a little more.

I recently enquired at your Chichester store about buying meat and cheese at the deli counters but taking them home in my own containers in an attempt to minimise the amount of plastic we throw away. The staff were really friendly  understanding and helpful  but said that they couldn t accommodate. I ve had to start shopping at a butchers instead  which is an extra trip with my 3 young children  but they re more than happy to weigh the meat on compostable greaseproof paper and transfer to my containers. Because of this  my weekly spend with you has gone down from £60 to just £10  and to be honest of finding a lot of your competitors use more eco friendly packaging on the items I still get from the supermarket  so I ve started shopping elsewhere.

I m a new mum to an 11 day old baby and having to wash EVERYTHING and even throw items of food out (fruit) as they were dripping with stain remover was not how I planned on spending my Saturday morning whilst dealing with a crying newborn baby. The items were clearly not packed properly or this would not have happened. In addition to this I also found that there was a bag with glass jars in and the bag had holes in the bottom- again  could have been a disaster to have to clean up a smashed jar of apricot jam or apple sauce if the bag had given up.  I m a loyal customer of yours and this is not what you expect when shopping online. I may re-think where I place my order next time.

Having recently visited two of my local stores (Leek and Hanley) I ve noticed there seems to be a distinct lack of trollies with a double seat. With an 8 month old baby and a 3 year old (with a tendency to run off)  the double seat trollies are a necessity when shopping on my own with them. I know trollies aren t cheap but a few more would be really useful. Thanks 😊;;;;;2016-12-03T19:35:10+0000;1480793710;2016-12-03 20:35:10;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I mentioned this to the young lady at the checkout and she seemed truly embarassed and said it was some promotional song . I know the staff don t have any say in what s played  or the volume  but honestly  it was so loud it hurt my ears.

Received my click & collect Tu order today. One of the items was too big so rang customer service. I asked if a smaller size could be located in any of my local stores as could not see it online. The agent appeared most helpful locating 3 of the jumpers at Pontypridd store (he did tell me that the numbers were not a live amount) so he would ring through to the store and check if they had the size I required.  A while later of waiting  the agent came back on the phone and said the store had the size I wanted and would keep it for me behind customer services. Off the phone I came a happy customer. So 2 and a half hours later I make my way to the store  hubby goes in and comes out empty handed to be told that they do not have said jumper behind the counter. Now you have one very disappointed customer.;;;;;2016-12-03T18:13:45+0000;1480788825;2016-12-03 19:13:45;0;11;0;0;11;11;2;9;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am writing independently to Sainsbury’s and Tesco’s shortly as I have a serious complaint. Despite being vegetarian for approximately 25 years I kept getting pernicious anaemia. B12 injections were not fixing the problem so I consulted with a nutritionist who advised me to eat fish and chicken.  I started to eat your salmon that is on offer all the time (3 packs for £10.00 – both Tesco’s and Sainsbury’s) in 2006. Following a variety of consultations  I was diagnosed with a whole host of parasite infestations including fish flukes. it is totally abhorrent to me how this could have happened. having lived abroad for more than 25 years whilst being vegetarian I have not been exposed to meat  fish or seafood during this period and was oblivious to the concept of fish farms and how fish are loaded with antibiotics and other toxic chemicals/ medicine.  Furthermore  I was misled by your promotional marketing advising that products are  “responsibly sourced” (stet) which means nothing to me now that I have been infected with fish parasites.  Regrettably I have a whole toxic cocktail of parasite infestations and had to consult with professionals about how to eradicate it. Really the idea of it makes me absolutely nauseous.  Please respond to me forthwith and I will make my case independently by letter to you.;;;;;2016-12-03T14:20:50+0000;1480774850;2016-12-03 15:20:50;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

To me thats a pretty healthy customer.  From what i understand  all customers are important to you as a business. If this is the case  then why when I book an online grocery delivery for 7pm Friday evening (today) does the delivery guy (from Sydenham Store  London) haul the carry crates out of the back of his van onto the road  smash the tops off a few beer bottles  spray the rest of the groceries with beer then try to deliver them to me? I know this happened as I was standing at the front door as i watched him.  He was then quite rude to me as his manager said NO WE CANNOT RE-DELIVER THIS EVE. I m sure you ll agree this is unacceptable.  The delivery van registration plate was PO16 WJL and my order number is: 54831193 Its not good enough sainsburys.;;;;;2016-12-02T20:24:22+0000;1480710262;2016-12-02 21:24:22;0;7;0;0;7;7;1;6;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I recently shopped in your Winnersh store and purchased a pork shoulder with toffee apple sauce which I was going to enjoy with your delicious potato dauphinoise  unfortunately upon opening the pork shoulder packaging the toffee apple sauce is no where to be seen. Although I have other condiments in my cupboards which will see me through this tragedy I am rather disappointed as I was so looking forward to tasty the sweet glazed that the toffee apple sauce would have provided. Is there any way you could find it in your heart to send me out another pack? so I give my starving belly what it so desires.

I checked the Sainsbury s website today for jumpers and found some I like. Rather than risk buying the wrong sizes and having to return them  I searched for the nearest largest store in my area and drove there. I was pleased to see many clothes aisles as I walked in. I walked passed the first  then the second and third and forth and fifth and sixth  until eventually finding menswear. It consisted of half an aisle of clothes  of which many were summer t-shirts being sold off cheaply. This is blatant sexism by Sainsbury s. If you don t want male customers  then fine  I ll take my shopping to Tesco instead. You ve definitely lost my custom.;;;;;2016-12-02T15:45:55+0000;1480693555;2016-12-02 16:45:55;0;4;0;0;4;4;1;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I applied for a job with Sainsbury in Paignton as a delivery driver  and they sent me a text message for a telephone interview. I called them and they asked if I have proof to work in the UK. I said yes  I have my birth certificate  and my driver s license.  They said that I need a birth certificate with my parents names on it  and the driver s license was not proof. A birth certificate  even without my parents name on it is surely proof. It s one that I have used since I got it in 1982 after leaving school  just for job interviews  and it has been enough since then. Also  you can t get a British driver s license without being a British citizen. I have a passport  but it is several years out of date. This is the first time that I have come across something like this  so why is it so strict at Sainsbury s?;;;;;2016-12-02T15:32:02+0000;1480692722;2016-12-02 16:32:02;0;4;0;0;4;4;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

These simple choices help us all to become better consumers.

Been waiting for my order to be delivered between 9:30-10:30am today. Still no sign   I have 2 young children age 4 and 6months who have their bits in with that shopping as i m unable to get out and about to do a big shop like I did for today s delivery..  I ve emailed your company  aswell as spoken on a online chat via your website.. However the delivery driver was stuck in traffic this morning? .. It s now nearly 5pm  I have hungry children .. Aswell as now cold children as I ve been unable to get out top the gas up due to not knowing if my delivery would turn up whilst I was out..   I m not normally one to complain about this  however I spend alot of money with Sainsburys! And I m really impressed with the lack of communication or customer care your company has given me today.;;;;;2016-12-01T16:47:40+0000;1480610860;2016-12-01 17:47:40;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ordered several items  off of which would fit with ease within one box. However yesterday received one box which was minus three items. These three  items are very small in size equal to length 4.5 inches wide  1.5 inches  depth 1 inch  taking that into consideration you can understand my concern at having just taken delivery of three boxes each 3 ft long via 2 feet wide and 4 inch deep  each box housing just one of the items above. This is just one client  imagine the waste happening within your establishment right now. Someone needs a shake up with regards to packaging. Disgraceful waste of courier and packaging let alone the time taken for all. Further more to pay for a couple of rather expensive items which had   free gifts  inclusive to find them not received  made a phone call to be told  first come first served basis  Not the case  they  are readily available in all stores  in plentiful. Not amused !;;;;;2016-12-01T14:09:48+0000;1480601388;2016-12-01 15:09:48;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0
