Why should the food in your cafe  be not as good as what you sell in your shop ? Especially a thing like a bread roll.

Such bad taste I have rarely encountered and I used to supervise a group of adults with learning difficulties to pick orders for vulnerable people and I can assure you, they did not make as many errors as sainsury have with mine and, thats assuming that sainsbury employ staff with learning difficulties to do more than collect baskets and trolleys.

I ordered Fitbit on line and order was cancelled an hour before collection. My son was really disappointed. I was advised by the store to ring around and if there was one in store they could hold it for me, then could click and collect to get the online discount, which I did. I found one available at team valley (20 miles from where I live) so i reserved it, then set off to get it today. My son was really excited. We arrived at click and collect and were advised that the item wasn't available, nobody had rang to advise us. The man on the van stated that they were aware early on that morning it wasn't there, and someone was meant to call me, they hadn't. The advise given from the first store gave assurances that this wouldn't happen again.  My son was in tears and really upset. I was annoyed that this had happened twice,and nobody had rang out of courtesy. I went into the team Valley store and Julie (I hope this was her name), was lovely, she could see how upset my son was and resolved the matter. It meant I did need to pay  £80 for the Fitbit, but the £15 discount I would have got was put onto a gift card. She was professional, kind and efficient - as were the other two ladies serving at customer services. Admittedly,I won't be tempted to make another online order with Sainsbury's, however, I am really pleased that my son got his birthday gift, thanks to Julie and her team xx;2016-12-31T20:16:20+0000;0

In retail, especially big supermarkets, prices go up and down all year long. Sales of things are tracked and collated centrally and the info shows them what is selling well and what may be ' sticking'. Prices are adjusted accordingly. Also taken into account are ' manufacturers offers' where a consignment of product is bought in at a cheaper price than usual. The saving to the stores is split between several products to show a saving on a ' sticking' product. Of course when stocks of that special priced product runs out prices of other things do tend to increase. At this point the consumer takes notice, blissfully unaware of the many factors that can alter the price of a product from one week to the next. Sometimes ( as Sainsburys Faiza has said) prices from the manufacturer rise and its not always possible to absorb the increase without increasing the price on the shelves.;2016-12-31T20:00:19+0000;1

Mum phoned local store on 27 December and got £20 back for turkey plus £5. When mum spoke to me I said that's a joke, told her to phone head office which she did yesterday. She spoke to some customer service lady at head office, who was rather rude said she could offer another £5, when my mum said is that it, she replied she could only offer another £5. So in other words £15 in total for a ruined Christmas, she asked if mum ""wanted the voucher or not"", mum agreed to have it but only because she knew she wasn't getting anything else. Mum said she will not order with you again and was told by said customer service lady, ""they wouldn't send out a rotten turkey like that knowingly"" well they did. Disgusting after service, how would you have liked a rotten turkey and a spoilt Christmas day, there were 10 of us with no Christmas dinner !!! Thanks very much Sainsburys.;2016-12-31T13:17:08+0000;0

If you changed the taste in any way, perhaps the packaging should have reflected this 'news', Change for Changes sake, this breakfast cereal was always still better than Coco pops or similar products? I could think of a mountain of other products that need your help for healthiness, but not this one.  My only hope is that these are not made by Weetabix and they decide to do the same thing without notice. I will PM my nector details. Thanks for the prompt response anyway.;2016-12-30T10:40:41+0000;0

Thanks for replying. Mum is fine thankfully. An infection and a temperature   and she is prone to passing out with things like that unfortunately, although thankfully she didn't yesterday or would've been scarier still. It was just after 4pm when it happened and was around 4.40 by the time they wheeled her out to my car, so they looked after us for quite a while. I also had my 12 year old son with me and they were checking he was ok too (it was at the hospital when it hit him and he got upset).  They did take Mum's details to put in an accident book or something at customer services. Mum's name is Julia Griffiths and she has already said she'd like to go in and thank them when she's feeling up to it but it would be nice if you could pass on our thanks in the meantime. It was definitely fabulous service.;2016-12-29T19:01:45+0000;0

Today i was out walking my dog  just for ten minutes  but i came back to find that your driver was in such a hurry to knock off early that after getting no answer on the phone he then turned up on our doorstep and rang the bell three times...it is a very loud bell and even the hardest of hearing can hear from outside that it has worked...but he succeeded in waking up my partner who was asleep after working a night shift  who then thinking it was something urgent pulled on his clothes only to find yet again that it was just the sainsbury s delivery man trying to deliver 90 minutes before my chosen delivery time...obviously he accepted the delivery. This is really not acceptable though  and after being a customer of yours for many years i am now so annoyed by this that i really don t know if i should use you again...some of your drivers are lovely  polite and grateful when i accept an early delivery but others are  abrupt and quite clearly just in a rush to get to go home for lunch or finish their shift early  having no respect at all.

This is really not acceptable though  and after being a customer of yours for many years i am now so annoyed by this that i really don t know if i should use you again...some of your drivers are lovely  polite and grateful when i accept an early delivery but others are  abrupt and quite clearly just in a rush to get to go home for lunch or finish their shift early  having no respect at all.

My partner even asked the driver yesterday why he had come when he had not received an answer on the phone and was told ""oh well people often say they didn't get the call or they thought it was a wrong number, so we just come and try the door anyway"" that was when my partner told him that i was out and had booked the slot purposely, and that he had been working nights.

Today i was out walking my dog  just for ten minutes  but i came back to find that your driver was in such a hurry to knock off early that after getting no answer on the phone he then turned up on our doorstep and rang the bell three times...it is a very loud bell and even the hardest of hearing can hear from outside that it has worked...but he succeeded in waking up my partner who was asleep after working a night shift  who then thinking it was something urgent pulled on his clothes only to find yet again that it was just the sainsbury s delivery man trying to deliver 90 minutes before my chosen delivery time...obviously he accepted the delivery. This is really not acceptable though  and after being a customer of yours for many years i am now so annoyed by this that i really don t know if i should use you again...some of your drivers are lovely  polite and grateful when i accept an early delivery but others are  abrupt and quite clearly just in a rush to get to go home for lunch or finish their shift early  having no respect at all.

I really appreciate how you have upped your game and provided superior grocery bags since the whole 5p thing.  Recently I completed the 4 day  W trek  in Patagonia  with just a sturdy Sainsburys bag for my food  water and book.

Anything with a longer expiration date than this is not considered a short life item. Consumer rights do apply to goods purchased online, however I am not in a position to confirm/advise whether this applies to perishable goods which have a finite life cycle opposed to goods which serve a specific purpose or length of service. It's possible that your fulfilment store has been including items with longer life with the short life items, however the policy itself has not changed.   If you PM me your order number, account holder's name, telephone number and e-mail along with the items which were affected, I'll be happy to get something sorted for you.

I just wanted to say a massive thank you for some brilliant customer service I received at your Wadsley Bridge store in Sheffield. I went into your store yesterday in the hope of buying a nut free christmas fruit cake (a new cake I know you ve been selling this year). Unfortunately it was out of stock. I went to find a staff member and he told me that you wouldn t be getting any more stock in now. But he offered me a solution. He said he d call up another shop in the city and see if they had any stock in. Thankfully they did. But he didn t stop there. He then offered to go and speak to a manager who passes by the other store and see if they could pick up this cake for me and bring it to my local store for today. The manager said yes it was no problem. What a lovely thing to do. The staff member who helped me was called Jack and I d love for him to know how grateful I was for such brilliant customer service. Unfortunately I didn t get the managers name but thank you to them too! Absolutely wonderful customer service for an allergy family who can t just buy any regular cake and given the fact that I had left it so late to get one it was entirely my own fault. So please let Jack know what a wonderful job he is doing. Thank you.

The manager said yes it was no problem. What a lovely thing to do. The staff member who helped me was called Jack and I d love for him to know how grateful I was for such brilliant customer service. Unfortunately I didn t get the managers name but thank you to them too! Absolutely wonderful customer service for an allergy family who can t just buy any regular cake and given the fact that I had left it so late to get one it was entirely my own fault. So please let Jack know what a wonderful job he is doing. Thank you.

As expected it was manic! Sadly  shoppers were rushing  being rude  I even heard a boy no older than 6 apologise to a staff member because his dad was so rude to her! The staff weren t rude or unpleasant but there wasn t a very festive feel! To be honest  I m not surprised due to the way some of the shoppers were behaving! This morning (Christmas Eve at 8:15am) I popped to Sainsburys Alder Hills  which is my usual supermarket. I needed a few last minute bits & to collect my Christmas food order. It too was very busy BUT everyone (staff & shoppers) was calm and happy. People were stopping to say hello & chat & some were even browsing  just taking their time. The staff that served me were nothing but lovely! It s the simplest of things and my trip to Sainsburys this morning really has put me in such a festive mood! Thank you Sainsburys Alder Hills for showing that this really can be the most wonderful time of the year!

Ask any enviromental health inspector. It is your risk BUT at the end of the day, people have been affected by nasty contaminants in food that has gone past its use by. Do not confuse use by with best before. Best before means that you can eat it after that date, but the quality will not be as high. Use by means that: use by. I completely agree with Fliss. I would NEVER eat food that had gone past it's use by date. But it is a risk that many would take.;2016-12-24T10:06:17+0000;0

I must be pretty strange, since sell by and best by dates mean nothing to me. I have looked upon them as a rather cynical ploy by stores to prompt me to throw away perfectly good food, and buy more. I just store everything safely, and use my own judgement as to whether something is safe to eat. Which thankfully has never let me down.

You would not think it was two days to Christmas or that they even noticed any of the chaos because they were just so happy and polite 😊 Also two members of staff went all over the store searching for something I wanted despite me saying it s not that important and not to worry  they went about it anyway and found the next best thing and apologized a ton (even though it was totally not their fault it wasn t in stock 😂) I really do appreciate the effort!  It was crazy in there today but not one member of staff was without a smile and I left feeling very happy and organised so thank you to the Telford team and a very Happy Holidays to you all 🎄🎅🎁;2016-12-23T21:16:36+0000;10155598941959377_10155600841814377;pageowner;0;Aww that's lovely Baillie.

You may have seen some of those items available because we still allocate some stock to be sold on the shop floor for customers who'd prefer to just pop in and take a chance at what we have available.   Our Christmas Food to Order (CTFO) service is to help guarantee you get the items you want for your Christmas day dinner (but there are some options exclusive to our collection menu). My apologies for the dates on the goods, we do try to choose the best dates possible however the collection service is intended for customers who are purchasing food for Christmas day and as such we ensure the product life will meet that intended requirement.

We offer a Christmas Food to Order collection service from the 30th of September until the 15th of December for customers who want to place a special order for Christmas and to avoid disappointment if there are availability issues with certain items. I've contacted the store but unfortunately we won' t be able to provide these products today. As a gesture of goodwill, I've sent you a £30 gift card which should be with you within five working days. I hope you have a lovely Christmas. Sam.;2016-12-24T10:22:44+0000;0

Could you explain what the point is of running a service that can t keep up with its demands. I m 5 months pregnant  my husband is away for work  I have twins in bed ....and now no Christmas dinner! What exactly am I meant to do?  How can I go to the shops this evening? What if there isn t any pork and Turkey in the shops tomorrow.  I m shocked that shopping with you is basically a Russian roulette as to who comes first .... it s an outrage.  Thank you for not helping in the slightest  but for adding more worry to already stressful week.   Please could you let me know how you plan to rectify or save my Christmas dinner!

To do this at the checkout, you must have shopped in that store within the last 12 months. If you haven't, our store colleagues are able to perform a Nectar workaround. This involves one of our colleagues calling the Nectar helpline during their opening hours and then passing the phone to you to confirm some security questions. I'm concerned this didn't happen on your visit and you were given the wrong information. Maria;2016-12-23T20:15:22+0000;0

We ordered our turkey 2 months ago our turkey was too small and when we went back to ask if they had a bigger one we were told no they are for people s orders yet they failed to for-fill our order. Resulting in a refund onto a card even though we paid half in cash. We have had to go to another supermarket who were happy to put right the mess Sainsbury s had made. Imagine if we not in the financial situation to effectively buy two turkeys while we wait for the refund!!

I loved my work during the vacations at JS.  People assume you're not capable of, or aspiring to, anything else - let alone that you might enjoy it (I LOVED it and it was the making of me.)  The surprise when I was able to add up - explain I have a Maths A-level - what are you doing here if you've got an A-level in Maths?  - all that sort of behaviour.

I worked on the Fosse Park Asda checkout for 6 months including Xmas 1991. I always try to be really nice and friendly to staff working on checkouts now as I know how it feels to be ignored, belittled and even abused. I was once explaining to a young boy who'd asked how the scanner worked. He said I don't think I'd like to work on the checkout, at which point his father piped up, ""I should think not son but some people don't aspire to much!"".  Obviously thought I'd be too thick to understand and take offence!! I have never forgotten his rudeness.;2016-12-24T13:26:36+0000;2

I went to collect my shopping for christmas ... which i ordered weeks in advance to find that they had substituted my 3 bird roast for a turkey breast! If i wanted turkey breast i would have ordered it. I have now had to seek an alternative turkey as a breast was not suitable. Surely when the order is place there should be an allocation put aside for click and collect orders???

This is a complaint and I want you to deal with it as such. If you can't then please escalate to a person or department who can. I do not wish to have more points to spend at Sainsbury's. I tried that already and I'm now out of pocket by £100 (including cashed in nectar vouchers I couldn't use online). I want redress. That is for you to put me back in the same position I would have been in had you not made your error. That is £75 refunded to my bank account and you can delete the £75 of vouchers from my voucher wallet online. And I want some consideration for extra compensation for your error. But more than that, I want someone to explain to me how this can happen. How can you accept vouchers for an order only to change your mind AFTER delivery?? We save hard for Christmas, budget well, to ensure we don't get caught in the debt trap. And a large corporation like yourselves just make life that bit harder.

Last October  British Gas recommended Sainsburys Energy as a cheaper tariff as my current tariff was due to end. I contacted SE and received a reply on 18 Oct 2016  to say my energy switch to Sainsburys from British Gas would take 2 weeks. At the beginning of Dec I realised I had heard nothing further from SE so I registered a complaint on SE page and was given a complaint ref. number. I also went onto register the same complaint on British Gas website as they had recommended SE to me. I was surprised to see only a few digits difference between the complaints reference numbers of SE and BG. Then I realised BG and SE are one and the same.  Sainsbury s Energy is a trading name used under licence by British Gas Trading Limited  a Centrica company. Registered in England and Wales No. 3078711 I was told by SE that they had no record of me applying to  change   so I sent them a copy of the email I received from SE in October  and I was told it appeared that the request had been ignored. British Gas are not interested in my problem and have just said to contact SE as it is their fault  even though they are one and the same company and even use the same complaints and computer systems. As a result  BG have put me on the highest tariff possible as my tariff with BG has expired. After an initial response from SE on 7 Dec  I have heard NOTHING  so I am still paying their alter ego British Gas at the highest rate. I have contacted OFGEM  to ask why these so called  white label arrangements   which allow bigger companies such as BG to supply energy to companies who don t hold their own supply licence such as Sainsburys  are allowed at all. Why can t BG offer customers the same rate as their alter ego company? There must be some financial benefit in this for BG  but certainly not for the customer when they wash their hands of any problems encountered by customers in the so called   switch .  I continue to pay BG at the highest rate with no communication from BG or SE since Dec 6 2016. Trading Standards really needs to look at the practices of Big Energy Companies and the scams they appear to be pulling on customers.  It s Trading Standards and OFGEM I will deal with now as I have had enough of Big Business attitudes.;2016-12-23T09:17:36+0000;10155596795339377_10155598051349377;2d86cfe826e740878d5d4daf7d692d530dbe58eb;1;I haven't been given a customer reference number, if I had I would have put a review on Reevoo to join the other bad reviews such as this example :  Troubled joining process. Tried switching to them. Thought I had as I received a joining letter welcoming me and a contract. Few weeks later got a bill from my old supplier. Turns out Sainsbury's computer system couldn't find my address and auto rejected me wwithout telling anyone. They apologised and manually enrolled me. It's several weeks later but am now with them. But still sorting out some remaining issues. Very poor experience. Avoid.;2016-12-23T16:31:41+0000;0

Lots of substitutions which were not suitable so I will now still have to go to the shops.  Also  my £12 off voucher has apparently  dropped off  the order so not applied.

The platter I purchased was on the shelf along with more platters with a £10 price point. I wouldn't normally spend this as I have to shop on a budget but I thought it would make a lovely treat for the occasion. I was horrified to see that I actually paid a whopping £15 more than I expected!

Placed an order over a week ago for my christmas shop When I picked it up the bacon lattice turkey breast roast I had ordered had been replaced with a turkey crown with stuffing  at  full 25% more cost. I was told it had been substituted as the item I ordered was sold out days ago. It wasn t sold out when I ordrered it  though. The click and collect van at Upton couldn t credit the cost back to me as I didn t want a turkey crown as I don t want t have to deal with a carcass  so I had to walk into the shop and queue only to be told I had to go back to the van to sort it. I refused and after a short wait it was refunded but then I found that there were NO breast joints available that compared so I ve had to get other meat instead. I was looking forward to that on Christmas day and I m having christmas alone so I thought I could rely on Sainsburys to not screw it up.

The reason we have a home store system is so if your card is lost or stolen, people can't use it elsewhere. You can either speak with Nectar before making your journey to the store, buy something and use your card to earn points, so that's it's recognised on the system, or the colleagues in store can offer the workaround which means our colleague at the customer service desk will call Nectar to have your card activated in the store.

He was amazing 👍🏼👍🏼 my address is always hard to find and he was struggling so attempted to ring me but I missed the calls as I was feeding my baby. About 10 mins later I called him back and he came back and found us. He repeatedly kept thanking me for ringing him back to help with directions and was all round so friendly and pleasant! He even made me close my door and wait back inside while he unloaded so I didn t get cold. He then helped me with all the bags (unlike asda delivery men!)   He was brilliant and I will defo be recommending Sainsbury s delivery !  This man needs an extra Christmas bonus! 😉😉;2016-12-22T08:57:04+0000;10155592878969377_10155593626154377;pageowner;0;Hi Katy, that was really nice of the driver to help you!

Recently I had a poor experience whilst queuing at the cafe but decided against posting what had happened. Today I went to the cafe again to purchase a take away cappuccino. There were 7 customers queuing  one store colleague on the till and four colleagues prepping. When I asked if another till could be open I was told no they are prepping. Maybe they then reflected as a minute later they did open a second till. I get that they are busy but there was no evidence of the pace and friendliness that the colleagues in the main store display.

I called the Customer Care line and spoke to a very helpful  patient agent (annoyingly  I didn t get his name - but he was amazing) who actually took the time to listen to me. He offered to call the store for me and see if there was anything they could do. I figured he d just put me on hold for ages and come back and say nothing could be done. I was stunned when he came back to say he d spoken to someone at the Warrington store and that he had offered to go and check the store for me for all the missing items! He promised me a callback within an hour. Simon Jones at the Warrington store called me back within that time frame and had found almost all the missing things for me! Not only that  but he then found someone to deliver them all (at no extra cost) on their way home! Geoff was the kind driver that brought my Christmas dinner essentials to me at the very end of his shift  when I m sure he d have much preferred to just head straight home. Thank you SO much to all involved for truly outstanding service. All 3 people I dealt with were incredible and deserve recognition. It s so rare nowadays to receive such great service. I still can t quite believe it. It was my first time ordering through Sainsbury s home delivery and  thanks to Simon  Geoff and the guy at Customer Care (might have been Alan?)  I ll definitely be doing it again. Happy Christmas! :);2016-12-22T07:41:11+0000;10155592735244377_10155593574619377;pageowner;0;That's fantastic to hear Emma. When did you make the call?

Also I'm always getting problems in that cafe at that branch. One time when I bought sausages and mash the mash was as tough as Poly Filler and no joke, I stuck my fork in the mash and managed to lift the entire lot off the plate. With proper mash that is soft you can't do that, the fork slides out of the mash. Some of the other meals had parts not cooked properly and others with parts that went cold. Sometimes the tea and coffee is cold and the fizzy drinks were quite warm. I'm never eating there again because the food is like hospital food in there and I can imagine like prison food. I said I can ""imagine"" it's like prison food and not ""like"" prison food because I've never been to prison.;2016-12-22T13:27:45+0000;0

You can recycle  filter cartridges in BRITA recycling ‘bins’ in selected retail stores. As Sainsbury’s also sells BRITA branded products, our customers can use their bins to recycle cartridges. As the cartridges have multiple components, they cannot be recycled in the same way that recyclable household plastic packaging / products can be. You can use the BRITA website to locate a recycling store using the link below: http://www.brita.co.uk/brita/en-GB/cms/dealerfinder/dealerfinder.grid. Your local stores don't provide this service yet however  believe that Argos do this on a wider scale - it looks like the Argos at 12-16 The Harpur Centre MK40 1TP Bedford do this. Hope this helps.

I ordered that really niche Christmas delicacy  a turkey (you might not of heard of it but it s sort of like a larger  uglier chicken) and apparently it is not available and there are no suitable substitutions. Not a single one to be had anywhere. I know these birds are really rare and you probably didn t anticipate someone wanting one at this time a year but thanks a bunch. I am sure I will have a totally non-stressful time finding one at over the next few days and it s not like I didn t place this order WEEKS ago (I placed it weeks ago). Christmas is ruined etc  insert Daily Mail-style sad face picture and so forth. In all seriousness  you owe me a turkey. I don t care what you have to do to get me a turkey but I want my turkey and I want it to be delivered tomorrow evening between 7pm and 8pm.

Firstly we found out our nectar card was not exclusively ours and all our points we had collected were in fact going to another man who had spent them. Nectars response was have another one on a zero balance and start again... Reluctantly started again collected points in store over the remaining months of the year to use at Christmas. Went to the till yesterday with the points in order to redeem them only to be told the card wasn t registering and we could only add the points from our shop. Customer services response in store was when you next shop here (we don t shop in Sainsburys anymore specially went to spend our points) you can use your points on your shopping and they also told us that the till worker should have called them over  they would have saved the transaction then called nectar and it could have been resolved  so now Sainsburys are also not training their till staff properly! I can t believe nectar and Sainsburys are so non plused about nectar espically with the Incident of the other person using our card  these points have monitory value!  And home delivery  one of the hotest days in summer I was 35 weeks pregnant  delivery driver turns up on my door and dumps the crates on my door step  no help carrying them in and stood there whilst I struggled heavily pregnant moving our £100 worth of shopping into the kitchen. No offer of help once  I get its hot and he most likely couldn t be bothered with the amount of drops he had to do but bending over and up again numerous times to bring my shopping in at 35 weeks pregnant was not fun!

Firstly we found out our nectar card was not exclusively ours and all our points we had collected were in fact going to another man who had spent them. Nectars response was have another one on a zero balance and start again... Reluctantly started again collected points in store over the remaining months of the year to use at Christmas. Went to the till yesterday with the points in order to redeem them only to be told the card wasn t registering and we could only add the points from our shop. Customer services response in store was when you next shop here (we don t shop in Sainsburys anymore specially went to spend our points) you can use your points on your shopping and they also told us that the till worker should have called them over  they would have saved the transaction then called nectar and it could have been resolved  so now Sainsburys are also not training their till staff properly! I can t believe nectar and Sainsburys are so non plused about nectar espically with the Incident of the other person using our card  these points have monitory value!  And home delivery  one of the hotest days in summer I was 35 weeks pregnant  delivery driver turns up on my door and dumps the crates on my door step  no help carrying them in and stood there whilst I struggled heavily pregnant moving our £100 worth of shopping into the kitchen. No offer of help once  I get its hot and he most likely couldn t be bothered with the amount of drops he had to do but bending over and up again numerous times to bring my shopping in at 35 weeks pregnant was not fun!

Orders should not be taken  if they cannot be fulfilled.  This is the first time I ve looked at your own website and it s obvious Im not the only customer you have let down this Christmas .      Judging by the amount of customers you have upset over the past few days with this issue I ll be surprised if they continue shopping with you as I certainly will be moving elsewhere.  No point being loyal to a brand that has no interest in customer relation.   You may be having an extremely busy Christmas period but you still have January onwards and I m sure and hope your footfall and online sales  will drop as customers you have dealt with this badly will not return and judging by your Facebook page there are a lot of  people from Aberdeen and all over the country not getting a turkey with their online shop . Maybe one if your staff could nip to Waitrose or Morrisons or Marks and Spencer and but enough to use for  your own orders !!  Shamefully treatment of customers and to tell me I can have a refund in 3 to 5 days and have a nice evening is taking the  P .  In capital letters !!!!!!!

I m very disappointed that almost all of my shopping for Christmas dinner is out of date 21st  22nd  23rd! Surely the shopper would realise it was for Christmas dinner? Now I have to go out to the supermarket and re buy it all. With three small children and a chronic pain syndrome  this isn t what I wanted to be doing.

If a product has the same date as your delivery date, or has been substituted, we’ll pop it in a blue bag if you’ve elected for bagged delivery. For bagless orders, we’ll highlight on your delivery paperwork so you can easily check. If you’re not happy with any of the products we've picked for you, let your driver know and they will return it for a full refund. Dee;2016-12-21T11:34:23+0000;0

She deserves praise for going out of her way to help me.  After receiving the Christmas order catelogue through the door in November   my 2 year old son and husband did some some  cutting and sticking  using the pictures and made a picture of what they would like for Christmas from Father Christmas! Among other things  my son had chosen the  polar bear cake  and my husband the  Limoncello Buche De Noel  .  I didn t realise these were Christmas order only products and had been repeatedly checking in store and on the normal online section. My son kept on saying how much he wanted the cake and didn t seem to forget about it.  In desperation  I went to customer service last week. Lynn Jordan  explained about the Xmas ordering ..... but I had missed the last date!  She explained that sometimes surplus come in store and she would check for me.  Today  she phoned me saying she had successfully got for them for me! She also explained that she had asked her husband to look in the store he works in AND had even discussed with one of the bakers in store about making me an equivalent if need be!

She deserves praise for going out of her way to help me.  After receiving the Christmas order catelogue through the door in November   my 2 year old son and husband did some some  cutting and sticking  using the pictures and made a picture of what they would like for Christmas from Father Christmas! Among other things  my son had chosen the  polar bear cake  and my husband the  Limoncello Buche De Noel  .  I didn t realise these were Christmas order only products and had been repeatedly checking in store and on the normal online section. My son kept on saying how much he wanted the cake and didn t seem to forget about it.  In desperation  I went to customer service last week. Lynn Jordan  explained about the Xmas ordering ..... but I had missed the last date!  She explained that sometimes surplus come in store and she would check for me.  Today  she phoned me saying she had successfully got for them for me! She also explained that she had asked her husband to look in the store he works in AND had even discussed with one of the bakers in store about making me an equivalent if need be!  This was exemplary service.  As a consequence of her help   I will have a happy 2 year old and husband on Christmas day.  In addition  she have me a voucher for quadruple nectar points.

I've had a look and I can see that these are the avocados you're referring to: http://bit.ly/1UcCQ2U however they're not labelled as our 'Basics' range and this may be where the confusion is coming from with the team in store. Unfortunately it seems we've stopped stocking the muesli though. If you PM me over your Nectar card number, I'll get some points added to make up for missing the coupon offer and we'll log a product request for you and see if we can start stocking the muesli again!

Fresh turkeys that all have one half frozen kind of defeat the purpose. You may want to let your Spilsby store know this.  And possibly ship them a whole bunch of new fresh turkeys.

Why will I bother buying my gifts from you next year when their value will reduce by nearly 75%well before Christmas day?;2016-12-19T22:19:20+0000;10155582531314377_10155591214889377;3403030851b54e0fe06035c8a25ed3e20dfb7fc5;0;Good for you Jane.Eve.;2016-12-21T22:34:17+0000;0

Called them again at 21:00 and they told us that we won't be getting our order today, arranged a slot for 7am-8am in the morn (obviously lied when they said our order was loaded in the truck). They rang us back at 22:00, getting us out of bed to say they could not honour the slot. Requested 6-7pm, again, couldn't 'promise'! Had a huge row with the lost slots manager who refused to give his or his managers surname so I could raise the matter formally. Because of this I have cancelled the order. To much stress.

Today at about 3.30 in our local branch (Cotgrave) my 6 year old daughter was sick whilst in the que. another member of the public informed your staff and they said they would be right with us. I didn t want to leave it for anyone else to clean up or step in it. 20 minutes it took and multiple comments off members of the public to your staff before someone came to help us. She was clearly distressed and embarrassed by what had happened and was left for everyone to see. And then when someone finally did come they had no compassion towards us at all. The only member of staff in that store that showed any customer service to us was a new member of staff who as I am aware has only been with you for a week. They were more bothered about getting the que down which in all honesty never goes down quickly than dealing with a issue which carries a health hazard. Yes I know it is only a job in a shop and you don t expect to be dealing with these things but you are meant to employ staff with customer skills not 1 person who helped us today had any of these. I for one will not be using that branch again until I know your staff carry the basic skills it takes to be a customer retail assistant.;2016-12-19T20:16:49+0000;10155582178219377_10155582414439377;pageowner;0;Hi Heather, really sorry about this, I hope she is OK?

Unfortunately you're not able to redeem two vouchers of the same value on your shop, but this is a technical issue that we're working on. You should be able to see your evouchers in the wallet if you use a laptop or computer, or if you switch to the desktop version of the site. Could you PM your order number and the name on the account? I'll see what I can do. Leigh;2016-12-19T08:27:09+0000;0

It's just a very busy time of year for people and having their shopping delivered takes away one element of that. Maybe many pregnant women have decided to have it delivered😉. I have had my slot booked since 27 November, not because I think the world is ending but for convenience.   I know it's not always easy getting about when pregnant but that's why planning can be key at this time of year.  Could you maybe add your shopping onto a friend or relatives home delivery?

I m extremely unsatisfied with this purchase  as not only has it ruined the Christmas presents that it came in contact with  i now have sparkly dogs  carpet  furniture and anything i have put in the washing machine since the unfortunate encounter with said wrapping paper. Now as this may seem wonderful to have sparkling Rottweilers and sparkly underwear  but i can assure you it has been quite uncomfortable for my partner and the dogs. Please put a warning label on your Merry christmas wrapping paper as this has been a very unpleasant experience. kind regards  a grumpy lady with very glittery dogs!;2016-12-18T20:22:05+0000;10155578678149377_10155580353229377;pageowner;0;Oh dear, sorry about the glittery disaster Katie!

We have told other people we know about sainsburys as people assume that only people who have a lot of money go there for shopping. But we have found your prices are competitive.

As long as you've shopped in the store you plan to spend your points in beforehand, it will be fine. If you're visiting a new store you'll need to ask the customer service team to call Nectar and enable you to spend points there (it's a security measure). You can spend them in 500 point increments which are worth £2.50 each. You'll have no problem redeeming £17.50 and the remaining 50p of points will be left on your card!

As Australians with a fondness for a good snag from the barby we expectedly find the group craving a quality sausage in a bun on the regular occasion  sadly your Sainsbury s Butchers Choice Pork Sausages do not seem to meet our expectations. The meat has a heavily processed taste and a soft rubber like texture once cooked which is not comparable with other higher quality sausages found on the common market. As a group  we would like to suggest the Sainsbury s butcher section considers updating this product to meet a higher standard of taste and finish.  Please take our suggestions into consideration and proceed as you see best fit Kind regards A bunch of snag loving Aussies.";2016-12-16T18:27:15+0000;10155571028999377_10155571327744377;pageowner;0;Hey Jonathan, sorry the product hasn't been up to scratch.

Walking round shopping, me pushing my daughter in her wheelchair, and a lovely girl called Amy presented us with a bouquet of flowers. So uplifting!  Then, we were having a coffee in the cafe in Sainsbury's Wednesfield, another day, when we were presented with a box  of chocolates. So thoughtful, Sainsbury's!

My husband put in £10 worth of petrol and I went into the petrol station to pay. I went to this blond hair lady and said: “Pump 2 please”  She didn’t make any eye contact nor say anything and she even shake her head. After 10-15 seconds I saw my husband about to put the petrol nozzle back to the machine so I said to her again: pump 2 please as I thought she might not heard me at the first time. Then she used extremely unpleasant tone of voice told me: “Yeah! I can’t do anything because I have to wait for him to finish”. I answered her: “Yes  I understand that and I am just telling you it’s pump 2. You don’t have to gave me attitude about that” then she said: “I have bad attitude?! You have attitude first.”  I said: How could i have bad attitude? I saw you shake your head first! Then she said: I didn’t shake my head  how do you know? What if I have a twitch?! In the end  I was so angry so I storm out of the petrol station and took this photo on the car as I didn’t have chance to saw her name on her name tag.

My husband put in £10 worth of petrol and I went into the petrol station to pay. I went to this blond hair lady and said: “Pump 2 please”  She didn’t make any eye contact nor say anything and she even shake her head. After 10-15 seconds I saw my husband about to put the petrol nozzle back to the machine so I said to her again: pump 2 please as I thought she might not heard me at the first time. Then she used extremely unpleasant tone of voice told me: “Yeah! I can’t do anything because I have to wait for him to finish”. I answered her: “Yes  I understand that and I am just telling you it’s pump 2. You don’t have to gave me attitude about that” then she said: “I have bad attitude?! You have attitude first.”  I said: How could i have bad attitude? I saw you shake your head first! Then she said: I didn’t shake my head  how do you know? What if I have a twitch?! In the end  I was so angry so I storm out of the petrol station and took this photo on the car as I didn’t have chance to saw her name on her name tag.   I immediately went to the store and made the official complained to the Manager Sharon. She told me there is going to be an official investigation but she can’t let me know what’s the further development of this investigation due to the confidential policy. But I just need to let your company know we will not use any Sainsbury’s service anymore even if that’s the only petrol station in the area. I would sooner run out of petrol and call the AA for assistance or even better visit one of your friendlier competitors Tesco or Shell.  I would sooner shell out (pun is intentional) on more expensive petrol from elsewhere than experience your appalling customer service again.  If your company and branch (Craigleith Edinburgh) do something about this  that’s great. If not then you have lost both myself and my husband as customers and I’m recommending all of my friends  colleagues and associates shop elsewhere.  Best Regards Liv;2016-12-16T15:40:29+0000;10155570505854377_10155646627454377;pageowner;0;Thanks for this information. We have added 2000 points (£10).

I was working, running the back watching the queues. When I heard a little girl in a pushchair crying. So I approached them and heard the little girls mom trying to calm the little girl down. So I asked if all was ok. She said her chocolate bear was broken. So sad to see her crying with no hesitation I went and got another one for her. It was lovely to see that little girl smile again :);2016-12-17T13:30:25+0000;29

This is actually a lot harder to do than the correct fitting. If the parts are correctly assembled and the filter holder is still leaking then it is possible that the rubber seal or drip hole is damaged. If you're still having problems fitting this then we can supply a replacement assembled unit. Megan.;2016-12-16T19:11:04+0000;1

I have a Filter Coffee Maker  one of your own brand models  and I ve had a mishap with a part of it.  It s designed with a safety valve that pops into action if I lift the jug off the maker  and unfortunately the valve has fallen out whilst I was washing up.

Tracey from your Guildhall Exeter branch deserves acknowledgement for going out of her way to help out my elderly neighbours.  The couple one of which suffers from coeliac s travelled 24 miles via bus to take advantage of your Christmas  gluten free range  unfortunately the one missing element was a Christmas pudding of which no Christmas would be complete without  Tracey went out of her way to source one and proceeded to beautifully wrap it and present it as a gift! This was a heart warming gesture of which they are truly grateful. So thank you Sainsbury s and Merry Christmas.xx;2016-12-15T19:52:14+0000;10155567437019377_10155567599044377;pageowner;0;Thanks Emma, that is so lovely to hear.

I ve just offered them Crispy Chilli Chicken for 2 (as I am off out tonight so off duty) to go with some veg. Speechless really that for £3.30 for 2 people the packet contains 5 small chicken fillets......5 for 2 people! What a complete rip off! Now I know why I rarely buy pre-made meals or shop in Sainsbury s. I can t share the photo as evidence sadly.

I ordered 40 boxes of cup drinks. 40 multipacks of crisps.  12 multipacks of haribo.  Says on the website when you ve ordered that for bulk orders they ll phone you before if there s and problems. Didn t hear anything so was looking forward to it all arriving.   You delivered 11 out of 40 boxes of drinks (plus random substitutes) 20 out 40 packs of crisps (plus random substitutes) 0 out of 12 packs of haribo with no substitute.  Delivery driver was suprised no one had phoned to tell me 66% of my order would not be delivered!!!  Hadn t had a sainsburys order before so asked driver about price promise on substitutions. He said there wasn t one - so i was in a difficult position and had to send some of the more expensive drinks back.  Turns out he was wrong and i could have kept those drinks at the price I d ordered.  So spent my evening chasing round for haribo and drinks that sainsburys should have let me know weren t coming. If I d have known 66% of the order wasn t coming I d have told you no to bother.  Very dissapointed. Wont be shopping online with sainsburys again.;2016-12-14T19:16:00+0000;10155563176439377_10155563366409377;pageowner;0;Hey.

Nectar changed for a year, (We now offer 1 point per £1 instead of 2 points per £1) but you should have more than just £20 to spare.

Even those that weren t discoloured had an unpleasant  tainted taste and consequently I have thrown the whole bag out.  I have just checked product reviews on your website and most of the recent ones give a one star rating. Comments include  Bitter.

I placed an order to click and collect at my store in Shrewsbury on 30th November which I find out tonight was delivered to Blackheath. The only option your customer service gave me was to go to Blackheath to collect myself or have a refund as you don t send orders between stores. It is too far to go myself and frankly I don t see why I should make the journey when it s your mistake. All but 1 of the items I ordered are now out of stock  well  actually they re not as they re sitting in Blackheath store  but you re unwilling to sort your own mistake out. You d think you d make the effort to get orders to people  especially at this time of year. Very disappointed and won t be buying from you online again.

Last week in your Tonbridge  Kent  store I wanted to buy a box of frozen Ham Hocks  usually I can reach them  but found they had been moved to the top shelf of the freezer cabinet.  The freezer cabinet was situated above a freezer which made it even more difficult to reach the item I wanted!  My usual remedy in this situation is to grab the nearest long package I can see and then use it to edge the item I want off the shelf.  But no - you have grown wise to this and I found there is now a 1inch high plastic strip along the edge of the shelf  which means the box of Ham Hocks had to be lifted up over this strip to get them off the shelf!  Is this a ploy to get older people to exercise more I wonder?  If so  you would have been proud of me  I stretched & stretched until I could stretch no more  and managed to get the item I wanted off the shelf!  Sadly  in the process I have torn or pulled muscles in my upper arm and shoulder and have been in agony ever since!  I have mentioned/complained about the positioning of some items before.  Both on-line and in store.  The in store explanation was that all store layouts are designed by computer.  I would like to point out that computers don t actually go shopping - so how would they know the best place to put an item for a human to buy it?  No  all computer programmes do is to show you the best way to cram as much as you can into your stores!  About time the person who designs the computer programmes stopped and thought a bit and realised that not all customers are young  fit and 6 feet tall!  I know you will tell me that I should go and find a  colleague  if I can t access something.  Well I resent this!  Yes - I am verging on elderly but I am fit and able (or was until last week).  Why should I need to add time to my weekly shop running back & forth to ask someone to get things of the shelves for me?  You may assume I am not happy - and you would be right!  So back to my original question:  Why do you issue your staff with round metal steps to stand on when stacking items on higher shelves  but then expect your customers to be gymnasts if they want to buy said items?;2016-12-12T19:23:46+0000;10155553192894377_10155553967579377;pageowner;0;Hi Anne, sorry about all this!

Henry and I broke down on the m5 today about 11.50am it was pouring rain and no where at the side of the road to safety wait as we couldn t get behind the safety barrier. About 10 mins went past Henry and I getting very wet and Henry crying and finally a SAINSBURYS LORRY pulled up on the hard shoulder to check if I was ok. At this point Henry has had a nappy explosion to top all things off  straight through his clothes and into the car seat. Craig Marshall was the lorry driver he cleared his cab and took me and Henry to the lorry so I could change Henry in the dry. He handed Henry up to me and then carefully took him off me so Henry was safe. He even said he would dispose of the poopy clothes and nappy which were in two nappy sacks!! He then helped me move my pram to a safer distance from my car  and finally he waited 45 mins in the pouring rain with Henry and I until a traffic officer arrived and the breakdown truck.  MY HERO who went above and beyond to help me. He works for NFT Bristol and they guy deserves such recognition from his company and Sainsbury s  Thank you Craig for restoring my faith in others and for such a kind act that made such a huge difference to me and my 19 week old baby boy.

I've also looked into this gift receipt you mentioned and our stores don't actually offer these as we have a standard returns policy. While we can't accept the return, its worthwhile noting that Prepaid Xbox Live Subscription passes can be stacked, so they'll still be able to make use of the gift - it will simply extend their subscription by 3 months.

Offering me vouchers is lovely but does not solve the problem.

The staff many who have been there for many years from the Kelly of Cults days were all dressed up with Xmas hats etc but no fault of their own there was absolutely no Christmas cheer as they stocked shelves. The clinical experience I have seen since it was taken over is absolutely awful with no atmosphere at all and the complete silence with no background music has killed off a community shop that has very few customers now.

It is the completely sterile atmosphere with no background music etc. I know that a lot of locals now use the Tesco express as an alternative.

Even the money off my Christmas shop voucher which came in the post so U'm assuming is part of a targeted xmas campaign is for use in store - and I have booked my online shop in advance as encouraged by email. I have been consistently shopping online for as long as I can remember - i want to say since my 18-year old daughter was a toddler - and vouchers used to be dual - so you could use in store but they always also had an online code. I think the current system is poor. But thanks for responding;2016-12-09T09:01:25+0000;1

We have been told repeatedly by the staff in sainsburys both on the checkouts and at customer service that they do not wrap delicate items. I am sorry I do not have the names of every member of staff who have served us in the last few months. When you are at a checkout abd ask fir something to wrap the glassed andchina that you are buying and you get told that there us nothing supplied you dont ask for the member of staffs name. Perhaps the manager needs yo find out what is going on in the store if all the staff are apparently telling lies to customers.;2016-12-09T16:27:10+0000;0

Our eldest daughter LOVES to go to the Sainsburys cafe and look around the store after especially the toy section. She is autistic and Sainsburys is one of the very few places that we can go as a family and relax because she is happy there. Today we went for our usual visit straight to the cafe. I went ahead with out other daughter after we had finished to look at the clothing section and my husband followed with B not long after. She bacame extremely distressed and had her fingers in her ears and fell to the floor and wouldn t move. So the first thing we thought was to get her off the floor put her in the trolley where she lay down with her coat over her head. She was relaxed so we left her. We were then approached by a member of staff who said we weren t allowed to have our child in the front of the trolley because they d had kids who had head injuries after falling from the trolleys. I said she has autism and needed to calm because the music was really loud. You don t usually play music?? To which he laughed and said we do at christmas. I then said why does it have to be so loud? He walked off obviously cheesed off with me talking back to him! I understand health and safety but I m pretty sure it would be my fault if she fell and hurt herself. Your colleague s attitude about my daughter s asd was appalling! He never even offered to turn it down for us.

I have passed this on to the store who I'm sure will deal with this situation for you. You should not have received this kind of reply at all and I'm very sorry they were parked on the double lines and in front of the disabled parking area. The store explained that any bigger vans or lorries do park in the back but the smaller parcel delivery vans stop in the front however, I'm sure they'll take this incident into consideration for the future.

Order appears to go through successfully right down to the last page saying they don t need your verified by visa extra security for this transaction. Then as you wait in the next day for your order to arrive you suddenly have that sinking feeling  and when you check your emails the confirmation email is not there.   Now order cannot be delivered (or collected) until tomorrow when delivery charge changes from £2 to £5.   What makes me even more angry is the poor response by Sainsburys to this issue. Today I was told to use a different device (which I don t have) or ring sainsburys every time I want to checkout online.   Last month I tried to order online  again the process went smoothly according to my screen right to checkout  unfortunately my son was rushed to hospital the morning I was due to click and collect. I rang Sainsburys from A&E and after confirming my details apologised for not being able to click and collect. Obviously I wasn t in the clearest of mental states but the operator definitely did not say anything about there being no order to collect! They just agreed to cancel my order as I couldn t commit to a new delivery slot.   Now while I didn t expect my order to magically arrive at my house as I have heard about with other supermarkets in cases of emergency  I did expect a certain level of customer service.   I have been loyal to Sainsburys since well before iPads  nectar points and the arrival of budget competitors  but sadly I feel this is the end of our  special relationship  and I shall be looking elsewhere for my groceries. Easier and cheaper than buying a new device that is  compatible .   I have been assured it is not just my iPad but all of them. I would be interested to hear other people s experiences.   From a very sad ex Sainsburys supporter.   Ps please forgive the Christmas film reference  it IS nearly Christmas! (And sorry I can t delete the mistyping below  appears my device is also incompatible with the Sainsburys Facebook page!!!;2016-12-07T11:22:07+0000;10155521946749377_10155522492929377;pageowner;0;Hi Lucy, sorry about that!

Some channels have regional variations, such as STV which has STV North and STV Central. It's possible you could be watching a channel that services both Scotland and England, but as you're tuned into the English regional variation. I've experienced this issue myself with Sky, but I'd recommend checking with your set top box provider or TV manufacturer for more info on that. If you're able to let us know the channel at some point, we can have a deeper look into things! Ryan.;2016-12-07T11:45:43+0000;0

Order arrived at the time requested on Sunday and after the driver left it became apparent that a large number of items were not delivered as the were supposed to be.

At the end of this I was told that there was no manager in to be able to contact the driver and find out what had happened. I don t know why only managers can contact drivers.   I asked when I d be getting my goods and was put back on hold for another 10 minutes.   A the end of this I was told the manager would be back soon and would call me then  or failing that would call me back the next morning.   No call that evening or the next morning so I called and went through the same scenario with the help line again. No record seemingly kept of my previous call despite logging it against my delivery reference number.   I was then told the delivery would now be between 1900 and 2100 the following day (today) but that someone would call the next morning to ensure this was still okay with us.

You cant speak to HR  you cant speak to head of customer services and the senior store managment hide behind assistant managment! Also  how can you run a superstore with one manager?

Today you managed to deliver £31.55 worth of shopping. I was happy to see i got undamaged tomatos this time (they were missed off entirely for the last order) however there was missing fruit and most inconveniently the pies i orderd havnt turned up.  Im here again writing this in the hopes that somebody might realise just how bad the service you provide is. I am now going to have to shop again or i will have little food in the house. Imagine if i wanted sometihng important like a christmas turkey  you never know whats going to turn up with sainsburys;2016-12-06T18:37:57+0000;10155519222149377_10155520040529377;pageowner;0;Hey Alex, can you let me know which items were missing?

I have spoken to the manager and your customer care team in the past about the increasingly dwindling stock in this store and always get the same response which is basically that it is not a main store so they cannot stock as wide a range as others. But the reduction in the baby products aisle is really quite appalling. (I have had to go elsewhere today, giving me an extra 40 miles drive all in.

I can assure you that this was not what we set out to do but unfortunately someone picked out a gammon joint which should have already been removed from the shelves. Our customer service team don't have access to an email service to be able to send an apology with evouchers as this is an automated system. If you like, I'd be more than happy to ask the online manager to call you for this matter to be explained to you further. Thank you, Sas;2016-12-06T13:19:05+0000;0

Delivery arrived and the delivery guy was great. Had the oven on ready to cook the gammon joint... Then saw the use by date was 5/12!!! Called up Customer Services who agreed that it is illegal to sell out of date food-health hazard etc... And offered me a £20 voucher to compensate and a refund of the £10 spent...  I explained again I had 5 people expecting lunch today and the whole lunch party was now going to have to be exported to a local pub... So I was offered £30 voucher...?  Finally after what seemed like an eternity on hold I was told that the Supervisors highest offer is £80 in vouchers (including the £10 cost of the gammon joint). Email vouchers have been received 1 x £50 and 1 x £30... Emails make no reference of an apology...

Especially as the majority of clothing retailers end their range at age 12 or 13 (sounds familiar Sainsburys?) and don t resume it again until men s wear. Most stores are hugely biased towards girls ranges (and women s tbh) but I ve usually found yours to be  slightly  more evenly matched. Plus the colours tend to be brighter rather than the normal greys and blacks. However  this gap in age range is incredibly difficult. Now two of my sons are in age 14 clothing  there is literally NOWHERE that caters for them. Step in  men s XS size at Sainsburys! The tees are excellent  super soft and mostly without tags (perfect for my fussiest guy) and everything is good quality and reasonably priced. HOWEVER  not all the range is produced in XS. All I need to buy for christmas are two cosy dressing gowns  preferably NOT in dark blue  for two teenage boys. I have scoured the Internet and high street  found nothing!

I'm so glad you've just posted that, as my friend has just posted this and it's rather upsetting! :-(   Let me regale you with an incident that just happened. I was taking my little dog out just now when at the bottom of my street a feral brat launched its bottle of juice at me. I mean it's plastic and it almost  missed but still. Now, this isn't a kid that lives round here. We might be a council estate in the wrong part of Manchester but the kids have respect instilled into them. So much to the extent that I have a friend staying who has a nice car and the kids who normally play in our road have gone elsewhere so that there's no chance of footballs etc damaging said car. But I digress. This feral brat, from a ""better"" area thought it amusing to launch a litre bottle of juice at me for the crime of my being ""fat"". I'm normally of the ilk that would just walk and pay no heed, or at the worst offer a colourful explanation of what I consider to be the problem with the child, but not today. Today I'm utterly disappointed in myself. I'll be 42 years old in February and do you know what I did? I actually burst into tears. Cried like a little girl. I'm deeply ashamed of that but here's my take on why. It's because of bullying I had for the same issue since I was a child, it's because in over 30 years nothing has changed. NOTHING. Some people still think it's OK to abuse and hurt others for such things as their size, gender, skin colour, sexual orientation, gender identity, oh the list is endless. And that's what our society is teaching folk. That it's OK to harm and hurt because of differences, perceived or actual.  Let me tell you something. It isn't ok. Not one bit. Do I hate the child that threw the juice bottle at me? In the moment it happened, yes I did. But that's a reflex.

She can be a diva sometimes but aren't they all 😀 She has the kindest heart and the sweetest nature. In Florida she gave a 'Thank you' note to the man who collected our cases for us from our room and when we came back there was a gift bag waiting fir her with a Mickey Mouse inside, a rose, a helium balloon and some colouring stuff. It said ""Thank you Isabelle for the kindest gesture I've ever had"" - just shows what a little thoughtfulness can do.... and we all presumed the Americans were all about the tips!!

My husband and daughter were waiting to pay at Sainsbury s for their fuel when an elderly gentleman in front of them was extremely stressed and worried as he had gone over on his fuel purchase by 13p and didn t have any other cash or means to pay the extra 13p. The staff were standing their ground and insisting the man (who was apparently quite upset and confused) fill out a form so that they could  peruse payment  from him..... For 13p! So  my 6 year old daughter who had her pocket money with her went and gave the man 20p. Shame on you Sainsbury s! However  on the flip side  it was very reassuring as parents to know that what we are teaching our daughter about kindness and thinking of others clearly means something to her. It s a shame the world we live in does not reflect these values a little more.

My husband and daughter were waiting to pay at Sainsbury s for their fuel when an elderly gentleman in front of them was extremely stressed and worried as he had gone over on his fuel purchase by 13p and didn t have any other cash or means to pay the extra 13p. The staff were standing their ground and insisting the man (who was apparently quite upset and confused) fill out a form so that they could  peruse payment  from him..... For 13p!

My 6 year old daughter has more kindness and compassion (and common sense) than some of your staff.

The staff were standing their ground and insisting the man (who was apparently quite upset and confused) fill out a form so that they could  peruse payment  from him..... For 13p! So  my 6 year old daughter who had her pocket money with her went and gave the man 20p. Shame on you Sainsbury s!

However  we discovered very quickly whilst unpacking that a bottle of stain remover had leaked over pretty much the bulk of the £140 shop. I m a new mum to an 11 day old baby and having to wash EVERYTHING and even throw items of food out (fruit) as they were dripping with stain remover was not how I planned on spending my Saturday morning whilst dealing with a crying newborn baby. The items were clearly not packed properly or this would not have happened. In addition to this I also found that there was a bag with glass jars in and the bag had holes in the bottom- again  could have been a disaster to have to clean up a smashed jar of apricot jam or apple sauce if the bag had given up.  I m a loyal customer of yours and this is not what you expect when shopping online. I may re-think where I place my order next time. In between feeding and changing nappies  I don t have time to wash my shopping before putting it away!!;2016-12-03T20:57:00+0000;10155508475754377_10155510498749377;pageowner;0;Hi Rosie, I am very sorry about this.

I know I was on hold a good while, the whole call was 17mins so I had no reason to doubt the agent didn't do his job. My husband said a couple of people were looking, think one was called Jess? They did offer my husband another choice, he obviously didn't want to choose one. When he told me I wouldn't want any of the others, that's why I chose the one I did. Wasn't expecting it to be too big. Was thrilled the agent sorted this when indeed it wasn't but don't know who is to blame;2016-12-03T18:27:44+0000;0

I am writing independently to Sainsbury’s and Tesco’s shortly as I have a serious complaint. Despite being vegetarian for approximately 25 years I kept getting pernicious anaemia. B12 injections were not fixing the problem so I consulted with a nutritionist who advised me to eat fish and chicken.  I started to eat your salmon that is on offer all the time (3 packs for £10.00 – both Tesco’s and Sainsbury’s) in 2006. Following a variety of consultations  I was diagnosed with a whole host of parasite infestations including fish flukes. it is totally abhorrent to me how this could have happened. having lived abroad for more than 25 years whilst being vegetarian I have not been exposed to meat  fish or seafood during this period and was oblivious to the concept of fish farms and how fish are loaded with antibiotics and other toxic chemicals/ medicine.  Furthermore  I was misled by your promotional marketing advising that products are  “responsibly sourced” (stet) which means nothing to me now that I have been infected with fish parasites.  Regrettably I have a whole toxic cocktail of parasite infestations and had to consult with professionals about how to eradicate it. Really the idea of it makes me absolutely nauseous.  Please respond to me forthwith and I will make my case independently by letter to you.;2016-12-03T14:20:50+0000;10155507350644377_10155507646444377;pageowner;0;Hi there, sorry about that.

I recently shopped in your Winnersh store and purchased a pork shoulder with toffee apple sauce which I was going to enjoy with your delicious potato dauphinoise  unfortunately upon opening the pork shoulder packaging the toffee apple sauce is no where to be seen. Although I have other condiments in my cupboards which will see me through this tragedy I am rather disappointed as I was so looking forward to tasty the sweet glazed that the toffee apple sauce would have provided. Is there any way you could find it in your heart to send me out another pack? so I give my starving belly what it so desires.

We have been open in selected stores on Boxing Day for the last 6 years and our sales data shows us that more and more people are shopping with us on Boxing Day – last year there were over two million transactions in our stores on Boxing Day alone. Where there is a demand, we will always try to meet this to better serve our customers. Thanks very much for contacting us and I hope you have a nice day. Goldie;2016-12-02T13:53:56+0000;0

I ordered several items  off of which would fit with ease within one box. However yesterday received one box which was minus three items. These three  items are very small in size equal to length 4.5 inches wide  1.5 inches  depth 1 inch  taking that into consideration you can understand my concern at having just taken delivery of three boxes each 3 ft long via 2 feet wide and 4 inch deep  each box housing just one of the items above. This is just one client  imagine the waste happening within your establishment right now. Someone needs a shake up with regards to packaging. Disgraceful waste of courier and packaging let alone the time taken for all. Further more to pay for a couple of rather expensive items which had   free gifts  inclusive to find them not received  made a phone call to be told  first come first served basis  Not the case  they  are readily available in all stores  in plentiful.
