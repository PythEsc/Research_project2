We ve recently switched from Highland Spring still spa water 500ml to your own still Scottish mountain water. We find it a good alternative but it is extremely difficult to open new bottles. Some have proved impossible to open without visiting the tool shed. I wonder whether you have received other complaints already but if not could I ask you to see whether this is a problem which needs attention. I am in my early 60 s and I cannot imagine how much more difficult someone older  or a child with their lunch box  would find this product.;;;;;2016-03-31T21:57:13+0000;1459461433;2016-03-31 23:57:13;0;13;0;0;13;13;3;10;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

On Monday I ordered 2 beautiful flower girl dresses online. The purchase went through successfully and I received a confirmation email.   I needed one other size which was not in stock online and found out that the nearest store that stocked it was a 3 hour round trip away. I proceeded to drive to the store as I needed the dress for my up-coming wedding.   I then received an email last night stating that Sainsburys could not complete my online order are were now unable to send me one of the dresses!! I was a bit shocked and rang my nearest store in Northampton.   Claire and her Team could not have done more to help. They managed to find a local member of staff that was working at the store 1.5hrs away who picked up the dress and bought it back to my local store for me to pick up!!!   Fantastic service and members of staff going above and beyond to rectify their online store issues!  10/10!!!   Best wishes  from one very happy customer!!;;;;;2016-03-31T21:43:27+0000;1459460607;2016-03-31 23:43:27;77;7;79;1;87;7;7;0;27;0;77;2;0;0;0;0;0

The double up points scheme is a great idea but doesn t work when the staff don t know which category your items are under.  One lady counted up the items in my basket with me and got my vouchers from Customer Services  however both she and the lady on the checkout didn t realise that a £10 item was Electrical  not Homeware. I was told the only option was to spend more on Homeware and get an Electrical voucher as they can t be changed. I ended up having to go to 3 different tills and in the confusion I forgot to hand over my nectar voucher and wasn t offered my active kids vouchers. Not great with 2 young children and a pushchair.  Why not just have double up vouchers which can be used across the departments and keep it simple for everyone?;;;;;2016-03-31T15:01:15+0000;1459436475;2016-03-31 17:01:15;1;3;1;0;4

Whenever I visit the store and he is serving  I feel honoured to be served by him. he is always enthusiastic and shows care and interest to all your customers. It s an attitude you rarely see now  most people are so consumed with hate for their jobs or in their own lives that serving someone seems a chore or as if it s getting in the way of their life.

I d had an....interesting morning with my non sleeper 4 month old (I m sure parents out there can relate) and Roger was so friendly and offered to go and get me a trolley I could put my car seat on. He went out of his way to help me and bring it to my car. When I said thank you he just replied that he will always help and all I need to do is ask.   I know it s only a small thing but he didn t have to do that and I really appreciated it!!  When I left I saw him collecting a wheelchair for an older lady and was helping her out of her taxi.   Roger  thank you for going the extra mile for people  you put a smile on my face!! You never know what kind of a day people are having and little acts of kindness go a long way!   Not sure if you do rewards for employees but I think Roger deserves one! From what I hear this is not a one off  he does good every day!   ❤️;;;;;2016-03-30T08:03:22+0000;1459325002;2016-03-30 10:03:22;9;2;9;0;11;2;2;0;0;0;9;0;0;0;0;0;0

I brought some products from the bakery reduced section and have got home to find I have been charged full price.

Without warning the plug was pulled and when next it was needed - nothing. We found a webpage in February and applied for a refund - nothing. Tried again over Eater and even tried to ring the 0333 number no meaningfuil reply just an endless queue. Finally tried a very helpful young lady on the 0800 customer service line who was able to find out that we were in fact owed £12.95 and that she would arrange for a cheque to be sent. No I do not want Nectar points. Its already 28 days since we first applied for a refund and no doubt another 28 days will pass. I rather think that Sainsury is hoping that people affected will simply shrug their shoulders and write of the few pounds they are owed. If they do this is as much theft as anybody walking out of a stire and not paying. Don t let Sainsury s get away with this.;;;;;2016-03-29T17:48:39+0000;1459273719;2016-03-29 19:48:39;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

They looked absolutely scrumptious and I was much looking forward to indulging in them one afternoon at work. I was blissfully unaware of the disappointment that was to follow  I couldn’t even finish eating one.  They were very dry  slightly resembling what I can only imagine sandpaper tastes like. Of course this also meant that they were completely tasteless. As if this wasn’t enough negatives about my ‘cookie’ experience  the amount of chocolate present in this cookie was dismal and quite frankly unacceptable seeing as they are advertised as ‘white chocolate cookies’.  To close off my whole awful experience it would also be apparent that they were overcooked  this is not what I expect from a cookie  let alone a Sainsbury’s cookie. As a loyal customer of Sainsbury’s I would never doubt the quality of food  but here I am left completely disappointed and not to mention an empty stomach.  I hope that you can do something to regain my trust in your product  I am very much looking forward to your response.

The decision to print Active Kids voucher with all the other coupons a shopper recieves is a really poor one. Our small Guide group has seen a massive reduction in the number of vounchers collected this year despite a large new store and 2 Sainsbury Locals being fairly close to our meeting place... They are too inconspicuous compared to the shiny  coloured versions given out in previous years and are obviously not being kept/collected as a result. I am sure this will make a huge impact on the equipment both us and other groups will be able to access this year. We have ben keen users of the scheme for some years and it has given our girls a great amount of opportunity through PGl trips and equipment but sadly that is unlikely to continue if the new vouchers remain as printed coupons.;;;;;2016-03-29T14:07:01+0000;1459260421;2016-03-29 16:07:01;1;7;1;0;8;7;2;5;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Which is fine  they give them with the meal but didn t think it was necessary to take it off me.

When it was not there 2. answer: We at Sainsbury s and in the UK are not selling veal in the UK any more because we have the highest standards towards animal responsibility. many thanks for telling me 1. that we Europeans don t respect animals 2. that he also told me that Sainsburys is obviously NOT treating animals responsibly (because in other stores you sell veal - I have bought it before..). 3. I am not sure if your people receive any training and if so - it may be some wasted money anyway  but at least tell them that they should say nothing if they have no idea what they are talking about!

We shop instore for small shops regularly but our local store is only small. I keep getting a discount voucher at the till for my first online shop so I thought I would give it a try (I normally use Tesco for home delivery).  I was extremely disappointed as we had two substitutions: First one was 8 beef burgers which were swapped for 4 burgers which were not only not enough to feed my family of five they also charged me more for them. I had also ordered a pack of 4 quarter pounders which were missing as well. Then I ordered 6 UHT milk in a multi pack which was replaced by 6 single UHT milk exactly the same. So I thought of well thats not too bad and just accepted the substitutions. The delivery driver asked us if it was the first time we shopped with them and failed to bother telling us that I had been charged extra for the substitutions which if I had known how much difference in price they I wouldn t of even accepted them. So my bill is more than it should of been plus I didn t get one of my items.;;;;;2016-03-28T15:23:49+0000;1459178629;2016-03-28 17:23:49;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

But i noticed the other day that a customer next to me on the Self Checkout got issued them through the coupon machine... so why don t i as everytime i shop i spend over £10.      I recently asked Nectar & this is the response i received :- Active Kids vouchers are operated by Sainsbury s themselves so unfortunately  we re unable to assist  I d advise contacting Sainsbury s directly on 0800 63 62 62 or at customerservice@sainsburys.co.uk for further information.

Did a flying visit to Sainsbury Melksham - not easy as I am disabled.  On leaving I turned the car around to ensure I left going the right way down a one way street for disabled parking ONLY  and at the turn encountered a Suzuki Swift coming down the wrong way.  The driver of the car was yelling at me ... although I was going the right way  she wasn t and was making hand signs at me. When they got past me  they drove straight into the disabled spot I had just vacated. The car had two females in  and they were clearly members of Sainsbury staff  from their uniforms  and running late for a shift by the way they sprinted to the store.  I got out and checked and sure enough  no disabled badge.    It is bad enough having to hunt for a parking spot on a busy day  and haul myself round the store when I am in constant chronic pain  without being abused by staff members because they were in the wrong.  I can proffer the car number - I have photos - if Sainsbury show any interests ... which I doubt  if this is how they train their staff.

Bought a medium pork farms pork pie today at £2.00 (knowing Tesco sell them for £1.50) no brand match voucher so enquired at customer services to be told (rather abruptly)you only price match Asda. Not much good when there is no Asda in the town where we live. On checking online when we got home Asda show same product for £1.75. Extremely disappointing. Why didn t customer services have the courtesy to check and refund difference.

Since then I ve been going to my usual Eden Street Store and buying the  same  rolls  except they are not the same at all!  Apart from being smaller  which isn t the main issue for me  they are completely anemic looking  with no  shine  and aren t that crusty or that nice.  In fact the last ones I bought had strange  almost fluorescent yellow/orange  bits  in them!  Today I went back to the Sury Basin Store and bought some lovely ones again.  I then went back into the Eden Street Store again and showed them to the girl stacking the bread and held them side-by-side with their version and asked why they were so different.  She basically just laughed at the difference.  If I had seen any of the usual staff/supervisors I wouldv e pointed it out to them but they didn t seem to be around today.  Please can you look into this and try and rectify the situation as it s not always possible for me to get to the other store and it certainly appears as if something is wrong!

Recently however  I have been disappointed especially with regards to your juices. As long as I can remember  you have always had a 3 for £4 deal for your juices. Recently I have noted the deal is no longer available. I am also disappointed with your selection of juices. You used to do a lemongrass combination one which was really good but that was discontinued. You then did a kale combination one and that was discontinued as well. I hope you can address these 2 issues for me : 1. discontinuation of good juices  2. discontinuation of the juices deal  Thank you;;;;;2016-03-25T11:36:53+0000;1458905813;2016-03-25 12:36:53;1;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

This is a lovely scheme to provide sports and cooking equipment for schools/organisations however I feel small organisations are disadvantaged by this scheme.  My son attends a pre-school which is a SMALL registered charity so receives limited funding from the government and therefore rely heavily on donations from the local community and through fund raising events.   I have browsed through your catalogue to find out the number of vouchers needed in exchange for equipment and I was frankly horrified.  For example  it takes 75 vouchers for ONE FOAM javelin that means people have to spend £750 before they contribute to this one cheap and simple equipment!  Today  I spent over £20 in store but over 4 transactions and I was refused vouchers because I didn t spend over £10 in one transactions.  I m sorry but this is very ungenerous and not acting in the best interest for the people you are supposed to be helping.  Also  I am disappointed that if you use the self served tills  the vouchers are not automatically printed.  It means I have to queue up again to request the vouchers  again how is this going to encourage people to collect the vouchers?  To be honest if I am helping you to save money on staffing tills by serving myself  the least you can do is make collecting these vouchers easier.  I am a loyal customer and former employee of Sainsburys and I would very much like to see improvement to this scheme especially to benefit the small organisations that don t have many people collecting the vouchers.  Yours faithfully  Celine Bray;;;;;2016-03-24T14:12:08+0000;1458828728;2016-03-24 15:12:08;8;1;8;0;9;1;1;0;1;0;8;0;0;0;0;0;0

He is dressed in black selling wristbands for a charity called SUPPORT THE HEROES.  This charity is bogus and is a subsidiary to the PRIZE PROMOTIONS COMPANY based in Blackpool. The guy claimed the money s raised would help forces personell with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder but couldn t tell me how much of his money would help nor could he name the centres for PTSD sufferers in the UK that are run by Combat Stress for the assistance of veterans.

However  when I got home  I realised the pack contained 330ml cans instead of the 440ml which I am used to buying. Tesco and Asda are doing the 440ml pack for £8! Basically  I ve lost out on 1.1l of Stella. I m not happy and needless to say  I won t be using your stores again. I feel the  deception  (for want of a better word) is abysmal.

After 4 years of shopping online with you we have been treated appallingly.  In my order 2 weeks ago I ordered one pack of gluten free hot cross buns from your Swindon store.  Your store substituted my order with 11 packs of scones and only sent me one pack.    Despite two calls to customer services and on the second call a callback from your swindon store assuring me they will be refunding my money nothing has been done.    I m fuming that I have been left £20.00 out of pocket on items I didn t even order and I have been lied to by your staff!  Moreover the items that were damaged in my shopping orders over the last two weeks have been refunded to the value of £5.75 in a online voucher code forcing me to spend more money with your store to claim back my refund.    This included a pack of sausage rolls were 3 had been taken out (I presume for someone s lunch!) and no trace of the errant sausage rolls or crimps were anywhere in the pallet.  Your home service and customer services is laughable.  I feel like you have stollen £20.00 out of my purse.  As you have taken money from my bank account for items I didn t order and have not sent the wrong items you charged me for.   I won t be returning again and will be advising my family and friends to stay well clear as any mistakes you make you refuse to put right.  Any items you damage you refund in online voucher codes it s ridiculous!;;;;;2016-03-23T14:43:33+0000;1458744213;2016-03-23 15:43:33;0;12;0;0;12;12;3;9;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am a primary school teacher and thought you had a wonderful selection of Easter crafts for my class. I bought 3 packs of the  glitter foam Easter egg shapes  a few weeks ago: my intention was for each child to make them into a glittery rabbit. However  when I came to make one after school tonight  the packaging is completely misleading. Only 6 of them are glittery  not the advertised 12! While this might not be a big deal for some - unfortunately there will be 15 disappointed 5yr olds in class tomorrow. I have just got in after visiting 3 different Sainsbury s and there are none left. Not happy.  Here is the link for the Easter eggs.

I also like to suss out the deals and get ideas for dinners for the week as I see what s available  it s also good to just get out of the house. As a mum of 3 boys though shopping can be very stressful. I go when two of my sons are at school but I m still left with a 2 year old  which is...eventful 😉 Today my little shopping buddy was in a great mood & I think I must have been on a high because I made a school girl error...I let him OUT.OF.THE.TROLLEY!!! 😱 It was all going well enough until it was time to pay. My little man was too close to the doors  he needed watching & fetching but my trolley was full  I needed to unload and pack my bags too. The lady serving me took my bags and got packing. After becoming aware of the situation I then had another worker come and unload my trolley for me. I was able to get my little dude (kicking & screaming) back into the trolley but there was only one part to the strap in the seat so I couldn t strap him down & he was desperate for his freedom back. The check out lady continued to pack all of my shopping so I could make sure my child was safe. There is no definitive value for service like that!!!

My boyfriend has long been buying your meal deals for lunch from a local branch in Durham. Since he is against buying bottled water  he decided to bring his own water in a recycled bottle and buy only the remaining two items (sandwich and dessert). Turns out that if you are environmentally conscious and don t want to buy another bottled drink every time  you can t get the meal deal and have to pay 60p extra. Not only is it ridiculous that you have to pay more for fewer items; it ethically questionable to encourage your customers to buy a drink in a plastic bottle every time they shop. As a company committed to reducing your impact on the environment  I hope you can at least offer the same deal to those of us who do not want to keep polluting the planet with extra waste.";;;;;2016-03-21T10:10:57+0000;1458555057;2016-03-21 11:10:57;1;5;1;0;6;5;3;2;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I revamped my bathroom in Sept  14 and decided the blue  grey white stripe range was  the one  for me.

I was horrified to find the range had changed to a wider blue / grey stripe  with an additional white grey stripe but decided I d have to live with it and bought 2 more hand towels and 6 face cloths with the new stripes. Now having some OCD tendancies  this really was bothering me so I decided to relegate the  older  style bath sheets and hand towels to a guest bathroom and buy more bath sheets  hand towels  bath mats and facecloths in the newer stripe for my main bathroom  but OMG!!!! you ve changed the range again!

On entering your store I saw the numerous Easter eggs but I noticed the  Small  sized easter eggs of Cadburys and Mars were £1.25 and listed as a  Managers choice . Now I have noticed on numerous visits to your store in the past 6 weeks that these size eggs have been priced at £1.25 and had not gone up or down in price. Moving the eggs to the front of the store is obviously fine  but sticking a sign up saying  Managers choice  but still charging the same price as before is extremely misleading. In actual fact I saw a family purchase some of those eggs because they presumed they were on offer. Ironically  round the corner at Morrison s they are selling the same size eggs at £1 and not claiming they are a special offer. Surely what you are doing is against trading standards? I think many would see  Managers choice  as reduced / special offer.

I had to cut loads of horrible bits of initially and then when I came to eat it the chicken was really chewy and I wasn t able to eat it. I also used the sainsburys microwave mushroom rice which was also awful. Sticky  chewy and flavourless. I have rang to complain and sainsburys have refunded the chicken and the rice and offered me £4 good will on an e-voucher. How generous of you sainsburys. £4 to me is not good will and does not allow for the inconvenience of having cooked a tea  not been able to eat it and then having to go out and get something to eat at 8pm at night.

We went into this branch to do our weekly shop  and approached the meat counter in the store looking for steak. There was a pre-packaged slice of meat at the counter to the side  and we asked the woman on the counter next door if she could possibly pass us the pre-packaged meat we were looking at. She said she couldn t leave her counter  and we would have to wait for her colleague come back. My partner then replied   it is pre-packaged and just on the side here  could I not just pick it up myself?  She didn t reply  and therefore my partner leaned to the side of the counter to pick it up - suddenly that same woman employee EXPLODED  and began shouting at the top of her voice in complete anger  WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE - GET BACK!!!. Customer s all around stopped  and began staring at her. We were in complete shock  and another customer also waiting at the meat counter starred too in horror. Then that same woman employee persisted to say -  I will come around and serve you  BUT LET ME JUST GET INTO THE APPROPRIATE CLOTHING  in the rudest voice  before slamming down her pinafore and exiting her counter. (oh so she can leave her counter.. she was just too lazy to serve us before?!) As she got changed and came around to the meat counter  she starred disgustedly at us  and said  I m not happy with you  in a sneering way. At this point  I was in tears! And another customer standing at the meat counter who had witnessed the entire thing said she couldn t believe how this woman employee had reacted and that it was actually verbal abuse! This customer asked for her name  and said she was going to complain  and the woman employee whose name is JANE  replied  Go and complain  I don t care .  In tears and shaking  I want to the customer service desk  along with my partner and this other customer who had witnessed everything (and was going to complain about this incident anyway because she was so disgusted). We then persisted to wait nearly 20 minutes for the manager to appear. We told him what had happened (the manager is IAN)  and he seemed pretty shocked. He reassured us he would find out what happened  and speak to JANE before contacting my partner (we provided all our contact details) by Thursday with an apology and what action had been taken. Well we haven’t received an apology  and I want to know what exactly has been done to resolve this? I am completely and utterly disgusted and upset with what happened. How dare this employee JANE speak to my partner in such a way? You wouldn’t speak to your dog like that?! I am usually a regular customer at Sainbury’s but after this  I certainly will never be returning to this store  and probably no others! What a disgrace!";;;;;2016-03-18T15:19:55+0000;1458314395;2016-03-18 16:19:55;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0

I was very disappointed to see that even though I had specified  no plastic bags  nearly everything was unnecessarily wrapped in a small  clear bags.  The packers had even gone to the trouble to wrap a vacuum-packed packet of bacon  something which is pretty impossible to break into normally and highly unlikely to leak.  The most ludicrous of all though were the wrapped bananas. Clearly your packers think bananas pose a high risk of cross-contamination  even with their own natural packaging  known to most as skin!   In my life I have been lucky enough to travel the world and see some natural wonders.  Sadly  nearly all of these landscapes are littered with plastic.  It is a huge  global problem.   I would normally do my own shopping  to reduce my plastic consumption  but at 38 weeks pregnant this has become quite difficult. Please  please  please  for the sake of the environment  tell your staff to stop over-using plastic.   Kind regards   Merroney Green;;;;;2016-03-18T10:52:50+0000;1458298370;2016-03-18 11:52:50;0;4;0;0;4;4;4;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

A customer asked if I was OK. When I got up I tracked down a member of staff and told them I had fallen over and hit my head and took them to the spillage and they called the cleaner. They advised me to report my accident to customer services  which I did. No asking how I was  no offer of a seat while I waited as they completed the form  no telephone call  so I reported it again online. Four days later and still no response.

I traveled to Stafford from Wolverhampton to purchase The Divison on PS4 as this was the only store with stock which was feasible to travel to (all credit go to the live chat guy who checked and found the stock for me). Firstly  your Stafford store has a pay and display car park with no discernible option for those without coins to use it  which left me hunting around for somewhere else to park. Secondly  I wanted to use the points I had accrued on my Nectar card to bring the price down. Unfortunately  a so called security feature (it is actually very secure  well done) meant I wasn t able to do that. No  what I would in fact have to do is wait 24 hours for my Nectar Card to be registered with the Stafford store  and then go back and make my purchase. It is pretty ridiculous that there is no way to spend Nectar card points in a new store without having to wait 24 hours.  Serves me right for wanting to save a bit of money with the Nectar points I had saved up. Amazon  on the other hand  can deliver to my home this evening for free.;;;;;2016-03-16T11:46:32+0000;1458128792;2016-03-16 12:46:32;2;5;2;1;8;5;1;4;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

On the last occasion it was promised  the next day .  To be generous I have waited a month on each occasion to allow for time to process my request but have received nothing.  The sum outstanding is a mere £4.51. But it is the principle of the thing. And if there are tens of thousands of customers in a similar position it all adds up to a significant case of theft.  Sainsbury s have had my money since I last topped up the phone in August 2015.  I am therefore planning to boycott Sainsbury s in future and would encourage all my friends to do the same.;;;;;2016-03-15T15:57:20+0000;1458057440;2016-03-15 16:57:20;1;6;1;0;7;5;1;4;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Is it really that difficult to stock uniform for the schools in the area?  One of the local schools uniform is PURPLE yet my local sainsburys seems to stock every other colour (including  colour that isn t for a school in the town itself but one of the small village schools)  Seems very odd that they cant provide uniform for a school that is from reception to yr 6. The demand for it is there but once again goes unnoticed!

He was wonderful and was going to give me his phone to call someone  but he came over (armed with tissues  for me as I was a blubbering wreck!) he managed to climb over the gate and pull open the back door.

We are regular customers to your store  we always use the fast track scanner you provide  we did our shopping and got to the tills to find that there was no one on the fast track tills  we decided to queue at a normal till  which we queued at to find out  she s not trained to process the fast track scanners   while we were stood at said till there were two supervisors with head sets on talking amongst themselves and completely ignoring both us and the other fast track customers which had started to come to the tills  one of them eventually went and opened the fast track till after we had been stood for about 10 minutes at the other till. She walked straight past us when she clearly knew we were fast track as all our stuff was still in the trolley  kind of a big giveaway.  already annoyed we then went to the this till and asked to speak to the store manager  we were met with short answer of go to the customer desk and they couldn t call them with their headset  so what exactly are the headsets for  are they just used to talk amongst themselves because thats what it would seem? The store manager was called but instead we got the bakery manager as the store manager was not available  Please explain why you have fast track if it takes ten times longer to get through the tills  and why are all the staff not till trained to deal with fast track customers and also why the supervisors think that ignoring customers and having a chat amongst themselves is good customer service!!;;;;;2016-03-15T11:26:41+0000;1458041201;2016-03-15 12:26:41;1;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I must say I am slightly disapointed that Sainsburys as a whole dont stock dairy free / vegan cheese. We stock a very small range of lactose free items but not dairy free. My 1 yr old has a high cows milk allergy and is also lactose intolerant. Is there any way of sainsburys introducing a vegan selection in stores. I have to go to the other side of Exeter city to buy him a block of cheese from tesco where they do both a tesco free from cheese spread and also stock the violife range. Any feed back on this would be greatfully received.;;;;;2016-03-14T12:36:16+0000;1457958976;2016-03-14 13:36:16;0;6;0;0;6;6;3;3;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have reported serious concerns regarding your Didcot store on several occasions now.  I have been waiting for over 2 weeks for the store manager to contact me and yet nothing.  Following a final disappointing experience with the store yesterday I am officially out of patience with Sainsbury s Didcot.  Please can someone look at the complaints I have registered with both Patrick and Paul on the online shopping helpline and take action.  Failure to do this will lead to my last resort of contacting Trading Standards via Consumer Advice and/or the police as the actions taken by staff members at this store leave me no other option.  I had hoped this would be dealt with  in house  but sadly the store appear to not take the matter as seriously as this situation warrants.

After browsing your selection of footware I setled on a  pair but realised I would need to wear black socks  with them. So off  I went to the socks and chose a pack of 3 trouser socks. I then continued to mooch around the food isles and filled my trolley with impulse buys - as you do! At the checkouts all my purchases went through the till until one of the last few items seemed to be causing a problem - my socks! I was then told that as the till  couldn t find  my socks they were unable to sell them to me. When I questioned this I was told   It s in case something goes wrong with them  we wouldn t be able to take them back.  Now  I have two things to say about this: First - what could  go wrong  with socks? And secondly  If you can t sell them to me  why  are there racks of them in your  supermarket?   I have now just spent over £50 on shoes and a trolley full of impulse buys - and I can t even wear my desperately needed new shoes for work tomorrow!  Don t think I will be shopping with you again in a hurry!;;;;;2016-03-13T16:25:46+0000;1457886346;2016-03-13 17:25:46;1;9;1;0;10;9;3;6;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Well done sainsburys for emplying such lovely people 🐶🐶🐶🐶 the gentlemen in question had a bright red coat  dark hair and glasses;;;;;2016-03-13T08:28:05+0000;1457857685;2016-03-13 09:28:05;7;6;7;0;13;6;2;4;1;0;7;0;0;0;0;0;0

Did my first online shop last night as I had one of the Nectar discount vouchers to use  booked in for delivery this evening  all fine and dandy. Ended up having a call from my local branch to say that the delivery driver had been taken ill and they wouldn t be able to deliver to me tonight. I was at work and so didn t get the call. So they found my second contact number on my account and called my partner. This was all about 6 hours before my delivery slot and I must say how delighted I am with the service.   The advisor I spoke to was so sincerely apologetic almost as if she felt it was her fault! But these things happen  and now I know how well Sainsbury s in Stoke (London Rd) handle these tricky situations I will definitely be using them again. The advisor I spoke to was a shining example of customer service and they took the extra steps to ensure we got the message.;;;;;2016-03-12T19:42:47+0000;1457811767;2016-03-12 20:42:47;2;2;2;0;4;2;1;1;1;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

Ok....I have a small top up delivery booked for tomorrow. Total value of groceries in basket was £46. Brill  free delivery. I then applied a £15 goodwill commerce voucher at checkout (I had a whole bag of shopping not delivered but charged for last week)  meaning I should only have to pay £31 for my shop. Brill! NO! My  price to pay  was coming up at £37! I phoned customer services and the helpful lady explained that it s only free delivery if the value AFTER application of vouchers is £40 or more! How ridiculous! She said I could add £9 of goods to my basket to take it over £40 - so pay £3 to save £6! It also meant my voucher for £15 was only worth £9 essentially!  Please look too this back to front system sainsburys! In the end  I removed my voucher and will use it on a bigger shop.  The lady also pointed out that if my shop was £45 and an item for £6+ wasn t available on the day  as my basket would go below £40 I would be charged for delivery even though the original basket qualified for free delivery!

The kids attend a lot of charity events where they dance to help raise money for diabetes  breast cancer  macmillan nurses etc. Last year a handful of the kids entered their 1st dance competition in which they won their  category  they have now been invited to a big competition in Paris next year but the children/parents have to fund this themselves. Although the children do bag packing  busking  car washing etc etc they still need quite a lot of money  so a few parents are doing different things to try pull in a bit more funding  we are arranging a bingo night where there will also be a raffle  football cards  sponsored bounce and other things going on during the evening this is the reason for me messaging yourselves :-) i would like to know if you would like to donate anything towards raffle prizes bingo prizes etc  anything at all would be gratefully appreciated and would help the kids get that bit closer to Paris    look forward to hearing back from you.

I have been told today when I finally got through to speak to your customer services that I was not entitled to the voucher as below as although my the shops had been ORDERED in February the last one was DELIVERED in March . The offer stated three orders in February and I believe that it was in the terms and conditions that it said that the orders had to be delivered in February. Why could your offer have not used both words? I made a real effort to make these three orders.  I have been a sainsburys customer for years and spent thousands and thousands of pounds with you. I do not accept this and feel that the statement   three orders in February   is deliberately misleading when you could have just as easily said three DELIVERIES in February. You may have misled a lot of people with this  not just myself.  So I was offered tonight a £20  goodwill voucher  instead. I declined it. I asked to speak to a manager who basically said that I had to read the terms and conditions. The operative could not generate anything more than £20. He said his manager had left  then that his manager was just going into a meeting. I was not offered a call back from the manager. He stated the the offer WAS for three orders in February. I felt sorry for him. When I made my order on the 28th there was no delivery available on the 29th else I would have chosen it.   Question 1..When does your customer service manager put a meeting above customer service ?  Question 2. Why could a manger not have offered to speak to me ? Question3. Did you deliberately make slots difficult to book on the 29th February- I tried ! Question 4. Why could not the offer have been clear in the first place.  I expect you to stand by your offer. Please let me know how I can access the £45 voucher.  Otherwise I will always believe that I have been misled and you risk thousands of pounds of my custom and a sullying of your reputation for the sake of £45.

I was shocked & appalled by your TV advertisement that was aired last evening that showed a Hot Cross bun stuffed with Bacon. You have probably offended every Religion that associates the Cross Bun with Good Friday  the crucification of Christ. It is sacrilege to eat Meat on Good Friday... the body of Christ. I am a non-practising Christian  Baptised in the Church of England. I am not the only one that eats Fish  on a Friday. I imagine 50% of British people eat Fish on a Friday. To use a Religious symbol of the Cross Bun then stuff it with Bacon is offensive and I would hope that the advertisement would be cancelled or a non-meat filling be a replacement. I would also expect an apology to be made to all who share my conviction.;;;;;2016-03-11T17:16:19+0000;1457716579;2016-03-11 18:16:19;1;19;4;0;23;18;15;3;54;0;1;0;0;3;0;0;0

Yes  we don t normally shop with sainsburys but for someone from payments to talk to my partner Michelle condescendingly about the use of a prepaid card (becuase you don t price match subs) was a little off. It s turns out that we had to return £6 worth of subs anyway. The driver was not friendly either.  I was a long standing sainsburys customer whilst living in plymouth and so far my experience of Northampton has not met the high customer service standards I expect from sainsburys.

Clearly the number of dvds delivered was well in excess of the number of books so that this situation must have been deliberate.

I am seriously considering shopping elsewhere from now on. I am a single parent on a tight budget  whilst I appreciate the brand match scheme  what is the point of it if I cannot use the coupon? I do my  big  shop monthly online as I don t drive but cannot afford to pay for weekly delivery. I received a brand match coupon for £2.57 but can only use it online  I therefore am missing out on this coupon because it runs out before my next online shop. I explained this to your live chat team but they simply said there was nothing they could do. As a Sainsbury s shopper for as long as I remember I feel very unvalued as a customer and feel that I may as well shop elsewhere as my loyalty clearly isn t valued. As Asda is cheaper by so much perhaps I should shop there instead? £2.57 is a significant amount to someone like me on a tight budget 😞;;;;;2016-03-09T15:34:29+0000;1457537669;2016-03-09 16:34:29;1;9;1;0;10;9;6;3;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Whilst in there we decided to have lunch in the café. When  our food arrived I asked for some children s cutlery as this was an impromptu lunch and I hadn t bought any with mr. I was informed they had some cutlery they could use and this was bought out to us. It was rather chunky but better than nothing. Whilst we were eating our food my 3 year old started to cry. It turned out she had cut her thumb on the knife which she had been given whilst cutting a chip. It was a small cut but it was bleeding a lot so my husband asked a member of staff for a plaster. The member of staff called for a first aider who treated her thumb and filled out the accident book. The member of staff told me my children had been given cutlery that was for disabled customers and although they have children s cutlery in the café they don t know where it is. The knife I realised was particularly sharp  sharper than your normal cutlery and although maybe I should have checked it it should never have been given to a child.   Someone from Sainsburys attempted to call me a few days later  I was out and my husband spoke to the female who refused to speak with him and she said she  would call back - which she hasn t! I am very disappointed with this and the fact there has been no follow up. I am sure my children are not the only children who use your café and require children s cutlery.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards;;;;;2016-03-09T14:24:53+0000;1457533493;2016-03-09 15:24:53;2;5;2;0;7;5;2;3;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

She arranged for four very helpful men to come and zip tie my exhaust back on so I could drive to the nearest garage which they directed me to!

Its supposed to be a time saving service not a time wasting service!;;;;;2016-03-09T11:41:01+0000;1457523661;2016-03-09 12:41:01;0;7;0;0;7;7;1;6;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I booked for the 8-8 slot on Sunday evening. I had a call from your delivery drinker at 7.10pm asking if I wanted my shopping earlier but we were out of he area so had to decline. We were stuck in traffic and at 8pm the Grindr rang and I explained that we would be home in less than 5 minutes - he told me he couldn t wait as he needed to be elsewhere. When I asked what time he would be delivering my shipping he informed me that it would not be that day and to await s call from the store on the morning. This was unacceptable and I complained to customer service regarding this. I was assured that the river would return that evening and deliver  he never showed up. On ringing customer service again  the manager of the store said that the driver was clicking off at 10 so again  I wouldn t be receiving my shopping that night. On Monday my shopping was delivered. Yesterday morning I received and email saying that my shopping had been cancelled and they the cost of my shopping was being refunded back to my bank account. Another call to customer services shed absolutely no light on this  even the store couldn t give me an explanation (I am still waiting for a call back from the store?!). After waiting all day for a call  I contacted my bank who informed me that Sainsburys had infact taken 2 payments of £85??  Yet nobody could explain this?  Thic is awful service from a long standing supermarket and sadly not the first time I have encountered such ridiculous issues. You have lost my custom;;;;;2016-03-09T11:20:50+0000;1457522450;2016-03-09 12:20:50;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

They easily entered the car park under a barrier with a height restriction and took the children shopping. When they came to leave the car park the bus didn t fit under the height restriction barrier the other end! What? So in a oneway aisle the driver had to back up. I (with my full shopping trolley) walked back behind the bus to tell the drivers of cars behind to backup and stop other cars from entering the aisle. Really? Please as a matter of urgency address this terrible situation. Firstly  adjust the barriers and secondly how about an apology and donation to the charity. These amazing people need our help not obstacles. I hope you will look on this note kindly.

After that we went to do our shop but little one had explosive nappy and needed changed  staff at customer services took my trolley and looked after it while I got little one changed. I went back to finish my shopping with little one in arms and when I went to the tills the male cashier could see I was struggling as little one wouldn t be set down and called another member of staff to unpack my trolley.  The member of staff unpacking my trolley seemed to be a till supervisor who then called not one but two members of staff to pack my bags.

Being impatient  I rang the next day and spoke to Ben  Ben confirmed it was being dealt with and informed me  these weren t going to be on the shelves until Monday 7th..having gotten Mothers day out of the way. Ben assured me and told me they will put some aside and I will get a call.  Promised kept and a message was on my phone telling me the Lego figures have been set aside.

I pointed out that this isn t a sensible thing to do with food that s still frozen and perfectly edible  and that the food could go to local charities  schools and other community groups. Kathy said that Sainsbury s rules left her no choice. Clearly Sainsbury s  Food Rescue  initiative only applies to Sainsbury s customers  not the the retailer itself.

I sat down this evening to enjoy them and was shocked to see a fury moldy stem and lots of mushy rotting grapes. So  I took them back to the Sainsbury s in Piccadilly station (which is near to where I live) - and was disappointed to hear that the  supervisor  would not exchange these grapes (in their original packaging) as I did not have a receipt. I did not get his name but he was  supervising  at 20:35 this evening (7th March). He made me feel like the decayed rotting fruit was a result of something I had done and made me feel like I was trying to fiddle Sainsbury s over £2!!!! I was polite yet firm  despite feeling frustrated at his poor customer service  and informed him that I would be reluctant to shop in Sainsbury s again - his response was  good . He did eventualy exchange the grapes. Anyway  I think you need to educate this  supervisor  on how to deliver good customer service.;;;;;2016-03-07T21:01:50+0000;1457384510;2016-03-07 22:01:50;4;19;4;0;23;18;3;15;2;0;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

However when I got to customer Service I was met with a rather rude young Lady who said she couldn t help me I needed to find a member of Clothing...  I went off to find Said member and to my surprise after walking around for 20 minutes there was no member of staff...  I gave up and proceeded back to Customer Service. On the way I met a young man who I decided to ask of he could assist.  His reply was  I m not a member of clothing.  You ll have to find someone else   At this point I was pretty angry so walked out without my order...  I shall of course try again tomorrow but I wanted to say how absolutely awful staff are at this store!  How no one could just simply call a member of staff and find my order.  After all I have paid money for these. I had picked up around £40 worth of extra clothing whilst looking for a member of staff... Needless to say these got left behind and I shall not be bothering to purchase these!;;;;;2016-03-07T20:07:01+0000;1457381221;2016-03-07 21:07:01;3;15;4;1;20;15;10;5;7;0;3;0;0;0;0;1;0

I explained they had started to be eaten and a funny taste. She said its only milk its fine. Now im pretty sure use by dates are there for a reason. Not quite sure why shes even a manager. She was useless. When i asked whats shes going to do. She said you can have some more cakes. I ask for head office and only reaction i get is her wanting to keep the cakes.

Not only is the alternative £1 more expensive (because £1.50 isn t enough for some chocolate)  but it is disgusting. Do your buyers genuinely taste this stuff before they make decisions like this or is it simply so they can charge the extra £1 for 15g of chocolate?

Parents dont use these spaces because we are lazy but to allow space for us to take children and babies in car seats out of the car easily and without damaging other vehicles. If the spaces were at the other end of the car park we might actually get to use them instead of all the lazy ********* taking them first! Oh and if you have a car seat in your car but no child with you  that shouldn t give you the right to use them either.

Me and my husband popped into sainsburys in Lincoln to pick up a few bits with our two small children. Our 3 year old struggles in supermarkets  so sitting in the main bit of the trolley  while our daughter was in the baby seat  he had a melt down as soon as we got in the door. We reached the fridge section before his meltdown became too much and we couldn t calm him down. we were about to turn and leave when a colleague (sally) who was putting reduced stickers on some meat came over and gave him some blank stickers. He instantly calmed down and started playing with the stickers. She then presented him with a little toy that has lights and sounds and from that second we didn t hear any sound from him  he sat contented in the trolley while me and my husband could get some shopping. Her small gesture of taking some time out of her work to offer comfort to our son meant we could do our shopping and have a nice experience. It really meant a lot to us. Most people stare and make remarks  she was so understanding  it was lovely. I will be doing my shopping in sainsburys from now on! We did stop and tell the manager about our excellent service but I wanted to reiterate on here so she really gets the recognition she deserves.;;;;;2016-03-07T07:52:51+0000;1457337171;2016-03-07 08:52:51;454;24;459;9;492;24;20;4;30;0;448;5;0;0;0;0;0

An hour of clearing up ensued and a set of superman pyjamas now have a distinct scent of sour milk  needless to say my partner has given me a wide berth this morning as a consequence.

I can t give you one  I m only allowed to give them out for meat   I said  but the bag is leaking   then she  offered  if you can call it that to get the pack changed - that was the time for the runner to go and get a new bag  he got caught with another customer whilst I stood like a lemon waiting.  I tried Tesco a couple of weeks ago  which is the same distance for me and was actually impressed - I think I ll give them a go for a month as I reckon I ll get better service  And a good tip to your staff - even if you re having a bad day don t take it out on the customer - a smile and cheery face goes a long way;;;;;2016-03-04T19:45:40+0000;1457120740;2016-03-04 20:45:40;0;17;0;0;17;17;3;14;11;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We had done an online shop and via ‘click and collect’ had arranged to collect our goods between the hours of 5:30 and 6:30pm from the Chester store last night (although we know it is picked and delivered from your Cheshire Oaks store). At about 5:15 we got a call from a young man (I believe he was called Simon) to advise that due to staff sickness you had no drivers available to deliver our shopping and  if we really needed our groceries we would need to go and collect them from the Ellesmere Port store.   Getting to the Ellesmere Port store was going to be a bit of a problem for us at such short notice so Simon advised he could get our groceries to Chester much later in the evening  probably about 9pm. We took him up on this offer and Simon arranged to call us 15 minutes before he was due to arrive in Chester. He offered a home delivery for us but as we live in the middle of nowhere we decided to go and pick it up from the collect point as most of the time drivers get lost and we end up spending longer explaining where we live than it takes to get to the Sainsbury’s store.  I arrived at the Sainsbury’s Chester ‘click and collect’ point at about 9pm and the van was not there  I sat in the pouring down rain and freezing cold for a couple of minutes until a small car  packed with Sainsbury’s shopping pulled up next to me. Out of the passenger seat rose our knight in burgundy armour (I’m not sure what colour your fleeces are so I’ve gone with burgundy) Simon  who began unpacking our shopping from the boot of the car and started packing it into mine.   I questioned Simon on the lack of company van and it’s then when he told me he had brought the shopping to us out of the goodness of his heart. As there were no vans and no drivers  he had packed our shopping into his girlfriend’s car and got his girlfriend to bring him to Chester for the sole purpose of getting us our shopping. He even advised he was a couple of minutes later than expected because just before leaving the Cheshire Oaks store he checked over our shopping and noticed something was missing and he ran back into the store to get it. I was truly gobsmacked. What a hero.  It doesn’t matter where you go  you don’t see customer service like that anymore.  Please can you pass on my thanks to Simon (and his girlfriend) for their effort? They are both true examples of not just great staff but of great people in general and as such I hope Sainsbury’s can reward both Simon and his girlfriend for caring so much about the company and its reputation.  Our thanks once again to both of them  Ben and Clair;;;;;2016-03-04T08:49:36+0000;1457081376;2016-03-04 09:49:36;238;35;259;24;318;35;26;9;52;0;237;20;0;1;0;0;0

I went to purchase a Mother’s Day card from my large local store. Ugh! Why on earth does your company think that every mother - aka a grown woman - wants to receive a sickly  sentimental  glittery  cutesy  schmaltzy and PINK card?! There wasn’t a single card that didn’t fall into those categories  or a combination of some/all of them. My a-whiff-away-from-70 year old mother has never been any of those things and neither has her daughter or son; so why do you - or the card manufacturers - assume that we want to send that type of card to our mother  year in  year out  or that she wants to receive something like that?  What happened to all the other colours of the universe? What happened to other designs? What about those of us who by nature aren’t metaphorically covered in glitter and wear Princess crowns with butterflies whilst we glide around on a bed of perfection? What about sass  humour  blank cards  even spikiness  that reflects the real and varying relationships we have with our mothers? Why in the 21st century - and at all ages of womanhood - are women still mainly being defined by this sickly  glittery  candy floss pinkness when it comes to choosing a special occasion card to say what we feel about the women in our lives and to celebrate all that is wonderful about us?  The Customer Service Operator I spoke with at the store told me that you have no control over your card selection  that it’s done by an outside contractor. I find it hard to believe that Sainsbury’s doesn’t have the power to define what is sold in its stores  that it cannot request variety and diversity in its cards. I’m not the only person for whom your stores are the only option for card purchases due to varying constraints from disability to time. So please Sainsbury’s  can we have a bit less pink and a lot more everything else next year instead of Hobson’s Entirely Predictable Pink Choice!";;;;;2016-03-03T19:16:03+0000;1457032563;2016-03-03 20:16:03;2;5;2;0;7;5;3;2;0;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

On entering the store she was followed in very close proximity for the whole of her shop by the store security guard to the point she was made to feel extremely upset and anxious drawing the understandable conclusion he assumed she was a shoplifter. Naturally she was mortified that such an assumption could be made. She was so upset she raised this with the person identified as the manager in the store and was upset even more with the attitude that she was dealt with. The manager refused to acknowledge her feelings and proceeded to upset her even more to the point where she was brought to tears. The managers attitude simply reinforced her belief that they believed her to be a potential shoplifter and the actions of the guard were justified. Clearly this incident has been enormously upsetting for my wife who finds the implication of shoplifting to be utterly incomprehensible and what I simply cannot understand is how Sainsbury s employ staff that are allowed to refuse to acknowledge how a customer has been made to feel by the treatment they have received in their store. Clearly your organisation does not care how your customers are made to feel by your staff and are happy for judgements to be made about customers with absolutely no reason. This is clearly an enormous fail in respect of the treatment of customers and I encourage anyone that doesn t want to be on the receiving end of similar treatment to stay well away.;;;;;2016-03-03T19:04:48+0000;1457031888;2016-03-03 20:04:48;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

A filter lane off a roundabout and your van driver decided to drive alongside another car  effectively in the middle of the road on a road only built for 2 cars  1 in each direction  instead of falling back and sitting behind the other car. The van then hit the front driver side corner of the Vauxhall Corsa and ended up sideways  with damage to the wing of the other car. Not only is this wreckless driving  it s extremely poor representation for your company and brand. As a Sainsbury s customer I m quite appalled.

I notice none of my local Sainsbury s stock soya yoghurts or free from cheeses. I don t know wether this is due to my area or wether no Sainsbury s stock them. Tescos seems to have a large variety of soya yoghurts available and dairy free cheese such as violife  they also stock their own brands. Morrisons also stock violife. I was wondering wether this is something you would be looking at stocking any time in the future as I love a lot of Sainsbury s products and I appreciate that Sainsbury s clearly labels their brands suitable for vegans when vegan friendly which other stores are behind with and only label vegetarian. However I have to go to separate shops to purchase these other items and would be great to be able to purchase everything in one store. I was also wondering wether you would be interested in stocking vegan food to go with brands such as urban eat which do a variety of vegan sandwiches and wraps. Not only is the vegan diet becoming more and more popular and Under demand but people are always intrigued by new brands  healthy food and trying something new. Many thanks  Amy Atkinson :);;;;;2016-03-03T14:23:17+0000;1457014997;2016-03-03 15:23:17;1;5;1;0;6

Could this be the same  delivery driver had an incident yesterday that was also reported to yourselves??? An item worth £120 was supposed to deliver to my house yesterday that never actually got delivered! When calling you to find out where it was you said the item had been cancelled and you would investigate -  although it was never cancelled. Then you said it had actually been delivered and signed for yet you couldn t explain who it was that signed for the item when this was requested as there was only one person in the house who had stayed in especially for this delivery.  Apparently  the item was  signed for  and as this was the case you would not be providing a refund or the item to actually be delivered to my home. Told that an eldery woman signed for this at the delivery address and said it was for her daughter .. this could not be the case as no  eldery  ladies were at this address and no one had even knocked the door. When requesting to speak to the manager in charge he said he would call back within ten minutes yesterday ... still no phone call ... still no item ... and extremely poor customer service. Maybe you should employ decent delivery drivers that no how to treat the public with respect. Is anyone planning on contacting me back in regards to where the item is ??????;;;;;2016-03-03T13:05:43+0000;1457010343;2016-03-03 14:05:43;6;4;6;0;10;4;1;3;0;0;6;0;0;0;0;0;0

It hurts my back getting my son in and out of the car but the extra space to actually fully open the door makes all the difference. When I arrived at the store there were no parent and child spaces available but as I drove past a young man  who had just parked in the last space got out of his car and headed off into the store. He had no children  which wasn t that extraordinary as that always seems to happen  but what amazed me was that he was wearing a Sainsbury s jumper and was clearly arriving for work.

He always waves and smiles with everyone and is a general joy to be around. Today I witnessed him taking a basket of an older lady straight away and putting her shopping through whilst chatting with her on first name basis. Clearly something he does a lot and for anyone who needs it. He deserves a good mention and perhaps a little bonus. He really is lovely!;;;;;2016-03-02T11:13:48+0000;1456917228;2016-03-02 12:13:48;359;59;359;15;433;59;42;17;68;0;355;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am loosing my faith in Sainsbury s quality. We recently purchased your own brand four slice toaster from the Doncaster branch which after a few weeks went defective as the toast did not pop up at the end of the cycle. Then my wife made an online order which was delivered on 27/02/16  the next day the Parsnips she ordered were out of date and then on 29/02/16 the bag of Green Beans that did not expire until 03/03/16 were mouldy and had a dead bug in amongst them. We took the beans and the toaster back to Doncaster yesterday  recieved a refund on the beans and exchanged the toaster for a Morphy Richards one sa we did not trust the Sainsbury s brand  this however cost us £15.00 more to buy. Whilest we were in store we did some shopping  one of the items we purchased was a 6 pack of Sainsbury s Taste the Difference Buttermilk Crumpets that were on reduction. I opened the pack today to toast two each for my wife and myself. One of the crumpets felt damp which I thought was strange and looked different to the others as it had no small holes in it but I thought this is Sainsbury s but on eating the said crumpet I found that it had only been partially cooked at the manufacturers and was basically dough. The other five were not much better infact I ate one that tasted OK but the two I had toasted for my wife she refused as she said they tasted sour. This is not the kind of quality I would expect from Sainsbury s. You need to get your act together if you are going to survive in this turbulent times for retail.;;;;;2016-03-02T09:54:10+0000;1456912450;2016-03-02 10:54:10;0;7;0;0;7;7;2;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Delivery arrived on time but 8 pints of milk is missing. I phoned and was told the milk couldn t be redelivered as the vans  have a schedule   even though they understood the milk was important. I was offered an e-voucher to cover the cost but when I said I d prefer a refund I was put on hold and was eventually spoken to by a very abrupt colleague who just asked for my card number  no customer service or anything. When I said  is that it?   He replied rudely  yes that s it  and when I started to speak he again  he just kept repeating  goodbye  as I was clearly too inconvenient for him.  It s safe to say I won t bother ever getting a Sainsburys delivery again. Shocking service.;;;;;2016-03-02T08:34:14+0000;1456907654;2016-03-02 09:34:14;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

It is passed the delivery time and there is no sign or sound of a delivery. We ve had no contact from the driver  all your customer service lines are now closed so I cannot contact anyone (not that I should have to). Both me and my partner have work first thing in the morning  and by first thing I mean my partner has to leave at 6am so I don t even know if we should stay up to see if the delivery is coming or if we should just assume that we are going to have nothing to eat tomorrow!
