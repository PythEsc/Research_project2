We find it a good alternative but it is extremely difficult to open new bottles. Some have proved impossible to open without visiting the tool shed. I wonder whether you have received other complaints already but if not could I ask you to see whether this is a problem which needs attention.

I have bought a Dyson hand-held cleaner and a tablet computer using Tescos vouchers.  Where Tescos manage to annoy customers is by their pricing.  They would have priced the item at £119.99 and as they don't give change or allow one to overpay I would only have been able to use £55 worth of vouchers, or would have had to find something very cheap to up the total spend.  The overworked lady at the customer service desk said ""Our terms and conditions are not nearly as good as Tescos' "" so she is either a Tescos customer or has had other people misunderstanding the terms.;2016-04-01T06:49:12+0000;0

One day I saw some men in the head office uniform in the store and asked them about that. They said ""Nothing to do with us.  Ask the checkout supervisor.""   I had some time to spare so I asked the supervisor.  She told me that management policy was that she was to always have at least 2 people queuing at each position.  If there were fewer than 2 people in each queue so was to close tills and get the staff to stack shelves.  Then Tescos started a massive advertising campaign saying that if there were more than 2 people in any queue they would try to open more tills.  After that I noticed that queuing in Sainsburys was better.  I have no idea if that was because customers changed supermarkets or because management changed their policy.;2016-04-01T07:00:16+0000;0

His name is Gary and for however long he has worked there he has always been the most polite and lovely member of staff anyone could wish for. Whenever I visit the store and he is serving  I feel honoured to be served by him. he is always enthusiastic and shows care and interest to all your customers. It s an attitude you rarely see now  most people are so consumed with hate for their jobs or in their own lives that serving someone seems a chore or as if it s getting in the way of their life. But not for Gary. He is a true gent and professional and the community of Southbourne thank him.

I want to publicly thank Roger who works in the car park collecting trolleys.

He went out of his way to help me and bring it to my car. When I said thank you he just replied that he will always help and all I need to do is ask.   I know it s only a small thing but he didn t have to do that and I really appreciated it!!  When I left I saw him collecting a wheelchair for an older lady and was helping her out of her taxi.   Roger  thank you for going the extra mile for people  you put a smile on my face!! You never know what kind of a day people are having and little acts of kindness go a long way!

And you know that they will be in serious trouble? Good for you for not using them. The distance from the store is not the point, these spaces are usually wider making it easier to let/help children in and out, or perhaps getting a car seat in and out, therefore less chance of the car door hitting somebody else's car and perhaps denting it. Therefore avoiding some other possibly underpaid and hardworking person from having to pay to repair it. I'm not after an FBI style investigation and send the culprits to prison forever, just making a point that it must be ok for staff to use them to save themselves getting wet but did the customer. And sure maybe I won't take the children shopping for the whole of the year incase it rains while we are in the shop.;2016-03-30T19:06:35+0000;0

The spaces are normally wider so therefore if a parent is trying to get a child or car seat in or out, the car door can be opened fully and not hit some other persons car. I think we would all moan to buggery if our car door was hit/scratched/dented because somebody was struggling to get a car seat in their own car, and then left without leaving details, and therefore we had to pay the repairs ourselves.;2016-03-30T19:09:35+0000;0

This is an extensive review. Some of the changes include removing many Schwartz products from sale and introducing a much wider selection of our own brand products in redesigned packaging and new shelves in store. We will also be reviewing our range of speciality ingredients. The Elmlea and the Bottlegreen cordial are still ranged products, where's your local store? We can check if they're receiving a delivery of them. Danny.;2016-03-29T18:24:19+0000;1

The decision to print Active Kids voucher with all the other coupons a shopper recieves is a really poor one. Our small Guide group has seen a massive reduction in the number of vounchers collected this year despite a large new store and 2 Sainsbury Locals being fairly close to our meeting place... They are too inconspicuous compared to the shiny  coloured versions given out in previous years and are obviously not being kept/collected as a result. I am sure this will make a huge impact on the equipment both us and other groups will be able to access this year. We have ben keen users of the scheme for some years and it has given our girls a great amount of opportunity through PGl trips and equipment but sadly that is unlikely to continue if the new vouchers remain as printed coupons.;2016-03-29T14:07:01+0000;10154700703664377_10154700785629377;f9abbcd8edde22f3fd75d2a179d65fa2e832d72c;1;Thanks!

Who would have thought one of those things requires so much drilling and hammering at 2:30 to 3:55 in the morning.

I never said at the time as I was a support worker with two residents. But 1) she only wanted to address me not the one of the people I supported. 2) the second person I support was non verbal  I ordered for him but he doesn t have a necter card which I explained that he could not use the other person s necter technically as I am at work and it would be considered stealing but she had already taken his necter card off the person I support as  he might as well have the points . 3) I ordered a drink and got my necter card out  but she said  she had already put it through without  so I missed out on points. 4) we were looking for sauces and a customer came over and said that they give you them in pots here but we could have theirs  the woman working on the till then came over and said  we give these out with your meals and took it off me. Which is fine  they give them with the meal but didn t think it was necessary to take it off me.

We shop instore for small shops regularly but our local store is only small. I keep getting a discount voucher at the till for my first online shop so I thought I would give it a try (I normally use Tesco for home delivery).  I was extremely disappointed as we had two substitutions: First one was 8 beef burgers which were swapped for 4 burgers which were not only not enough to feed my family of five they also charged me more for them. I had also ordered a pack of 4 quarter pounders which were missing as well. Then I ordered 6 UHT milk in a multi pack which was replaced by 6 single UHT milk exactly the same. So I thought of well thats not too bad and just accepted the substitutions. The delivery driver asked us if it was the first time we shopped with them and failed to bother telling us that I had been charged extra for the substitutions which if I had known how much difference in price they I wouldn t of even accepted them. So my bill is more than it should of been plus I didn t get one of my items.;2016-03-28T15:23:49+0000;10154696221529377_10154696265449377;pageowner;0;Oh no! Sorry about this!

The third party app, has the number and a barcode. What I do not get, and am yet to get a proper answer about, is that my card was damaged so wouldn't scan, so the cashiers would input the number from it for me to get points.  Then the apps appeared and they accepted them either by scanning the barcode on the 3rd party or, when it didn't scan, I'd read them the card number from the app. Now, I understand the policy of not wanting staff to handle phones but there is no reason not to continue accepting the card number. I'm not going to order another card because it's wasteful and it will only get damaged again and we'll have the same issue so would love to know a good reason for not accepting the card number.  Also, there is absolutely no need for the cashiers to handle my phone in order to scan it.  I can hold, they can scan.  Problem solved.;2016-03-28T15:48:34+0000;0

If the nearby tourist attraction is having a big event and you re the nearest supermarket  stock up. If out of stock  I d have happily paid the £2.65 cafe price if one of your staff got me a £1 tin off the store shelf. In fact   your staff offered us no alternatives.

When I got to CS i asked the member of staff if she could put the points on and she said quite rudely 'not if you haven't bought them' I then went on to explain that there was no stock and checkouts said to come to CS. She then SIGHED really loudly and proceeded to phone checkouts who indeed told her that I was correct. She then sighed again whilst she was adding the points to my card. I was so shocked I didn't make a scene and there were people behind me.  I know Easter in a supermarket is a stressful time (believe me I know I worked in Tescos for 15 years) but I have never been treated like that before anywhere!

I've returned the item as I'm not paying £8 for an easter Egg that with the quantity you have will be heavily reduced Monday or Tuesday and receiving such bad customer service, not for the first time in this store.

Recently however  I have been disappointed especially with regards to your juices. As long as I can remember  you have always had a 3 for £4 deal for your juices. Recently I have noted the deal is no longer available. I am also disappointed with your selection of juices. You used to do a lemongrass combination one which was really good but that was discontinued. You then did a kale combination one and that was discontinued as well. I hope you can address these 2 issues for me : 1. discontinuation of good juices  2. discontinuation of the juices deal  Thank you;2016-03-25T11:36:53+0000;10154680872864377_10154681126294377;3b3a5ebe60fa160ce4932d534994084f1ce5e8f5;1;Thank you for your response.

I can log some product requests with our buying team for you to see if we can take these items back into stock however we can't make any promises. We're also currently phasing out multi-buy offers across our stores in favour of lower prices across our lines, in an effort to help our customers save more money and help lower food wastage across the country.

This is a lovely scheme to provide sports and cooking equipment for schools/organisations however I feel small organisations are disadvantaged by this scheme.  My son attends a pre-school which is a SMALL registered charity so receives limited funding from the government and therefore rely heavily on donations from the local community and through fund raising events.   I have browsed through your catalogue to find out the number of vouchers needed in exchange for equipment and I was frankly horrified.  For example  it takes 75 vouchers for ONE FOAM javelin that means people have to spend £750 before they contribute to this one cheap and simple equipment!  Today  I spent over £20 in store but over 4 transactions and I was refused vouchers because I didn t spend over £10 in one transactions.  I m sorry but this is very ungenerous and not acting in the best interest for the people you are supposed to be helping.  Also  I am disappointed that if you use the self served tills  the vouchers are not automatically printed.  It means I have to queue up again to request the vouchers  again how is this going to encourage people to collect the vouchers?  To be honest if I am helping you to save money on staffing tills by serving myself  the least you can do is make collecting these vouchers easier.  I am a loyal customer and former employee of Sainsburys and I would very much like to see improvement to this scheme especially to benefit the small organisations that don t have many people collecting the vouchers.  Yours faithfully  Celine Bray;2016-03-24T14:12:08+0000;10154676618509377_10154676670094377;pageowner;0;Hi Celine, thanks for taking the time to get in touch with us and also giving us feedback on the scheme, especially for smaller organisations/schools. I've passed your feedback on to the Active Kids team for when we review how the scheme works. Thanks and have a great day! Ryan.;2016-03-24T14:30:27+0000;1

This is easily answered. The Nordic/Germanic peoples (including the Anglo-Saxons) were comparative latecomers to Christianity. Pope Gregory I sent a missionary enterprise led by Augustine of Canterbury to the Anglo-Saxons in 596/7. The forcible conversion of the Saxons in Europe began under Charlemagne in 772. Hence, if ""Easter"" (i.e. the Christian Passover festival) was celebrated prior to those dates, any supposed pagan Anglo-Saxon festival of ""Eostre"" can have no significance. And there is, in fact, clear evidence that Christians celebrated an Easter/Passover festival by the second century, if not earlier. It follows that the Christian Easter/Passover celebration, which originated in the Mediterranean basin, was not influenced by any Germanic pagan festival.;2016-03-24T18:31:51+0000;0

The tradition of coloring and eating eggs came about from the ancient pagan festival honoring Eastra, the goddess of spring. The egg represents new life and the fertility of the season. Eastra was often depicted with a hare, which is where the Easter Bunny comes from. For Christians like you claim to be, Easter is a celebration of Jesus's resurrection and ascent to Heaven. It is a time of giving thanks to God for sending his son to suffer and die on earth and take the punishment for our sins. Yet, here you are, on Good Friday, making Easter all about candy. Shame on you, brother. You must repent and ask the Lord for forgiveness on this holy day. I will pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes and renew your faith in Him. In Jesus's name, Amen. - Joel Ottersteen;2016-03-25T17:06:43+0000;3

Nectar have authorised their cards on this app and nectar is attached to sainsburys, think you should talk to your partner ASAP as technology will be used more and more in the future, I am now going to spend my £150 per week elsewhere Tesco for instance, I have been a loyal customer for years and have been successfully using the app in your store for months so am a little perplexed as to this stance. andrew;2016-03-23T22:00:25+0000;1

All my nectar points scanned through the app on your stores have been added successfully to my account so it's not your software or your handheld scanners that are not working its your negative attitude to change, Coventry store tell me that bar code scanners can affect my phone......that rubbish as Apple and Samsung and all the big handset manufacturers would not encourage scanning apps if it did!

It is the active ingredient within ‘Roundup’ non-residual herbicide, which is commonly used by gardeners and by councils to control weeds.  Within wheat production it is used to kill weeds and grass that compete with the crop, often at the end of the wheat’s growing life as it is waiting to be harvested.  We monitor residues closely and ensure these are consistently below safety levels established by EU law.  Chemical or pesticide residues are very highly regulated under national and EU law and levels are also very small and are measured in mg/kg (or parts per million).  To put this in context a level of 0.01 mg/kg is equivalent to 10 parts per billion or 30 seconds in a century or 1p in a £1m lottery win!    Occasional detection's are found in bread, but such levels of residues are not currently triggering detailed risk assessments by Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD), part of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE),  for the Expert Committee for Pesticide Residues in Food (PRIF).  The detection's are going through standard risk assessment screens without any comments. (It is only when CRD/HSE cannot rule out safety issues that detailed risk assessments are prepared).  Sainsbury’s are in a unique situation as we work directly with our Sainsbury’s Wheat Development Group of farmers who grow British Milling for our in-store bakery.  This ensures we have close relationships with farmers who grow our in-store bakery wheat and enables us to collaborate together to drive best practice.    We work with our farmers and collect data for them on their carbon footprint, sustainability and how they improve the natural environment.  Part of this work looks at best practice in pesticide applications and going forward we will continue to focus on the responsible use of glyphosate.  We also offer our customers a range of organic bakery products, which are grown without the application of herbicides.  I hope this helps to answer any questions you may have. Thank you for getting in touch. Allie.;2016-03-22T18:02:24+0000;0

This is the third delivery I have received with this issue and I think it is unfair and ignorant for your company to send out goods that in store today would be heavily reduced in price. As a delivery company choosing produce on your customers behalf you should take the time to choose the longest date possible as your customers would do in store. Please advise how I can proceed with this complaint further or indeed how we can rectify this as I am not happy at all.

Best before dates are used for the majority of foods and is a date given to a product to allow for a reasonable length of life in which it is in optimal condition. It can be used after this date.  However, if you can prove it is not in a satisfactory condition to be consumed then they would be in breach of the Sales of Goods Act. Most places I'm sure would just exchange or refund!

Hi Sainsburys, Yesterday I bought a colour B4 product from your Newport store costing £10. Today I went to return the product (still in its box unopened) and with its receipt and was refused a refund! I find this really unacceptable at no point yesterday was I told that this product was non refundable. I have been a loyal Sainsbury's customer for years and have never had an issue before so to come across something like this has been really disapointing! I am now £10 out of pocket and stuck with a hair product that I don't want. Please advise me on how I can proceed with this. £10 might not seem a lot but when you've spent £10 on something you don't want/ can't use it really is a lot of money to waste!;2016-03-21T23:12:55+0000;0

I bought 3 packs of the  glitter foam Easter egg shapes  a few weeks ago: my intention was for each child to make them into a glittery rabbit. However  when I came to make one after school tonight  the packaging is completely misleading. Only 6 of them are glittery  not the advertised 12! While this might not be a big deal for some - unfortunately there will be 15 disappointed 5yr olds in class tomorrow. I have just got in after visiting 3 different Sainsbury s and there are none left. Not happy.  Here is the link for the Easter eggs. I feel very let down.  http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/sainsburys-glitter-foam-egg-shapes-large;2016-03-21T18:39:27+0000;10154663484624377_10154663879564377;pageowner;0;Sorry about this Alexandra.

My boyfriend has long been buying your meal deals for lunch from a local branch in Durham. Since he is against buying bottled water  he decided to bring his own water in a recycled bottle and buy only the remaining two items (sandwich and dessert). Turns out that if you are environmentally conscious and don t want to buy another bottled drink every time  you can t get the meal deal and have to pay 60p extra. Not only is it ridiculous that you have to pay more for fewer items; it ethically questionable to encourage your customers to buy a drink in a plastic bottle every time they shop. As a company committed to reducing your impact on the environment  I hope you can at least offer the same deal to those of us who do not want to keep polluting the planet with extra waste.";2016-03-21T10:10:57+0000;10154662024859377_10154662056189377;db7095bf5330aabc18c653fcb2fedf242bd91ac4;1;Yeah, I understand that only certain types of food qualify for the deal and I would even be willing to pay the same price for two instead of three items. But what baffles me is that the deal is disqualified if you buy only two items from the correct categories. If we are happy to pay the same price, what difference does it make to the retailer if we don't walk out with one of the items?

I had to get it delivered to work today  so chose a delivery slot between 9.30 and 10.30am  knowing that I would be in at 9.30 to accept delivery  however when I got in (just before 9.30) the shopping had already been delivered and my husband had to interrupt a phone call from a customer to unload the shopping from what he said was quite a surly delivery driver  who seemed annoyed at having to wait - even though it was before our allotted delivery time.

I revamped my bathroom in Sept  14 and decided the blue  grey white stripe range was  the one  for me. I bought 4 bath sheets 2 bath mats and 2 hand towels and went back the next week to buy more hand towels and face cloths to match. I was horrified to find the range had changed to a wider blue / grey stripe  with an additional white grey stripe but decided I d have to live with it and bought 2 more hand towels and 6 face cloths with the new stripes.

I've spoken to the Haywards Heath store to let them know of your comments. To get this resolved for you ASAP we need to test the coleslaw to see if it was at fault. To get this to our product quality team you'd need to return the item to your nearest store & ask for it to be sent off to the product quality department. Alternatively you can send this yourself via recorded delivery to: Product Quality, 33 Holborn, London, EC1N 2HT. If you chose to take it back to store, please let us know which store & when you'll be visiting. We'll call ahead to let them know to expect you. Kirsty;2016-03-20T15:25:52+0000;0

Just to let you know i went to refule today and got told by the staff they do close for an hour while your system reboots or something.  Anyway... i did ask that when the garage closes at night in april that the pumps will still be active, and was told no ? I dont see the point in pay at machine pumps if they cant be 24 hour. i am very annoyed as i use you for my bussiness and most the time i refule out of hours. so now we have to go to morrisons. not really going to have an effect on you with just loosing my two vehicles but i do spend over 40k a year in fuel with you and i cant be the only one put out by this. i just dont understand why the machines cant be opperated when you are closed;2016-03-21T16:52:17+0000;0

At this level, you are choosing to be offended. Also, sheep life span even naturally is usually less than ten assuming not predated by something first. So 'baby' in this context is kind of perjorative. A human would be a baby at this age, a sheep less so.  However, I would recommend people to buy direct from farm, from breeds which are native and which naturally breed later. That means Easter lamb will be a year old, and born in the warmth of Spring, not born inside in the depths of winter purely to race to get to market by Easter. It's much tastier too, and the sheep will have had a proper life.;2016-03-21T18:26:39+0000;3

I also used the sainsburys microwave mushroom rice which was also awful. Sticky  chewy and flavourless. I have rang to complain and sainsburys have refunded the chicken and the rice and offered me £4 good will on an e-voucher. How generous of you sainsburys. £4 to me is not good will and does not allow for the inconvenience of having cooked a tea  not been able to eat it and then having to go out and get something to eat at 8pm at night.  I have just moved my weekly shop from Aldi to sainsburys but I think I ll be returning to Aldi. Very disappointed with the quality sainsburys have provided and also the lack of good will gesture.;2016-03-18T20:17:48+0000;10154653004024377_10154654687734377;pageowner;0;Hi Sarah, can you PM us you order number and confirm the name on the account please?

I'm going to ensure someone gets in touch with you regarding this. We're just looking into the call with the careline at the moment so that we can find out exactly who was meant to call you as without the reference number I can't see the information. Can you tell me the number you called us from and the time and date if possible? I'll be able to get the information with these details. I apologise that this is taking this long to get resolved but rest assured we're on the case! Ryan.;2016-03-17T15:29:50+0000;0

Apparently I was in his way and instead of asking in a polite manner he just began a barrage of expletives at the top of his voice.  I am incredibly shaken by the entire experience.  I want to pass on my many Thanks to the incredibly caring staff of the Customer service department   a merchandiser and a cashier.  I just hope it was worth it for him!;2016-03-16T14:05:44+0000;10154644299749377_10154644363304377;pageowner;0;Hi Jo, i'm really sorry you had this experience in one of our stores.

I traveled to Stafford from Wolverhampton to purchase The Divison on PS4 as this was the only store with stock which was feasible to travel to (all credit go to the live chat guy who checked and found the stock for me). Firstly  your Stafford store has a pay and display car park with no discernible option for those without coins to use it  which left me hunting around for somewhere else to park. Secondly  I wanted to use the points I had accrued on my Nectar card to bring the price down. Unfortunately  a so called security feature (it is actually very secure  well done) meant I wasn t able to do that. No  what I would in fact have to do is wait 24 hours for my Nectar Card to be registered with the Stafford store  and then go back and make my purchase. It is pretty ridiculous that there is no way to spend Nectar card points in a new store without having to wait 24 hours.

If Sainsbury's has a company that they deem to be trusted by them and that they will accept then let me know but otherwise this sounds like a way to fob off the consumer and waste time.;2016-03-15T15:05:40+0000;0

Halal meat I object to the way it is prepared but respect the reason why it is done that way. Would I buy or knowingly eat it no.  I'm not moaning but I have respect for other people with their religions and the food that they may or may not eat and would not knowingly abuse a religious food;2016-03-14T22:02:52+0000;3

People telling other people what they can and can't do because it offends their religious beliefs. Which is exactly what you're doing.  Jews don't eat bacon, they don't celebrate Easter. I doubt a single Jewish person has thought 'How dare Sainsburys suggest other people put a meat I don't eat into a bun I don't eat'. Next you'll be offended on behalf of Muslims when people put booze in their Christmas cakes.  And if you're upset that corporations are twisting the meaning of a religious festival for commercial purposes, I assume you won't buy any Easter Eggs? Or a tonne of Christmas presents come December?  And you even said earlier it wasn't even your original complaint. Seems to me you don't really know what you're offended about.;2016-03-15T10:10:51+0000;4

Any feed back on this would be greatfully received.;2016-03-14T12:36:16+0000;10154637529474377_10154637762684377;4a02b8952d7290f35ffeff17f47359332de408f4;0;Thank you steven.

If items are out of date, or unsafe then I have no problems with this being highlighted at the till if the item has genuinely been missed on the shelf. But socks? Really?;2016-03-13T16:46:13+0000;0

After browsing your selection of footware I setled on a  pair but realised I would need to wear black socks  with them. So off  I went to the socks and chose a pack of 3 trouser socks. I then continued to mooch around the food isles and filled my trolley with impulse buys - as you do! At the checkouts all my purchases went through the till until one of the last few items seemed to be causing a problem - my socks! I was then told that as the till  couldn t find  my socks they were unable to sell them to me. When I questioned this I was told   It s in case something goes wrong with them  we wouldn t be able to take them back.  Now  I have two things to say about this: First - what could  go wrong  with socks? And secondly  If you can t sell them to me  why  are there racks of them in your  supermarket?   I have now just spent over £50 on shoes and a trolley full of impulse buys - and I can t even wear my desperately needed new shoes for work tomorrow!  Don t think I will be shopping with you again in a hurry!;2016-03-13T16:25:46+0000;10154634888294377_10154634979324377;ec1c99da53dec38c08f6607af01060d7599fa17c;0;We once has the same sort of issue with a piece of ginger. We were told we couldnt buy it as the till didnt know how much it cost.  Simon made such a fuss that they were so embrassed they gave us the small 4 cm piece for free to get rid of us. Lol. If its not able to be sold it shouldnt be on the shelf/rack.;2016-03-13T16:54:54+0000;0

I didn t want to cause a scene in store but this made me extremely mad! Awful customer service  he couldn t even be bothered to look or speak with us or apologise.

His whole image & service was lazy & unfriendly with a careless attitude!  I took the £5 goodwill without any question and would have been happy with an apology and some acknowledgement from a manager but now having thought about the whole situation £5 wasn t good enough & neither was the service provided I am disgusted.

I was very disappointed with the level of service I received from Fed who deemed to be the manager in charge  however I find it very hard that he has such a title as he did not role model well to his peers and certainly didn t meet my needs as a customer.  I visited the store today to make your store aware of what I found in a wholemeal 800g loaf produced from your in-store bakery which I regularly buy. Having personally sliced the loaf and given it my child to eat  I found a clump of blue cleaning cloth wrapped amongst the middle of the loaf. I was very shocked  my child may have choked on the material if I wasn t paying attention.   I went into the store and to the customer service desk/ kiosk and explained to the lady there very quietly as I didn t want to cause a seen & make it publicly known  as I understand accidents can happen. She said she needed to make management aware & to speak with us; she called  Fred  several times  he looked and ignored her. The colleague herself then apologised for us waiting and even said he never acknowledges me. She then alerted a team leader on checkouts by pressing the buzzer. (Even though Fred was less than 3 meters away) the team leader came over & again apologised but said he needed to ask advice from a manager. He walked over to Fred & explained what we had said (which we heard as we were stood so close to him) Fred shrugged his shoulders  never acknowledged us and then replied oh just give um £5 I suppose. I didn t want to cause a scene in store but this made me extremely mad! Awful customer service  he couldn t even be bothered to look or speak with us or apologise. I doubt it will even be followed up with the bakery so it doesn t happen again because he was stood scanning toys next to the magazines for atleast 10minutes afterwards and then went to checkouts. His whole image & service was lazy & unfriendly with a careless attitude!  I took the £5 goodwill without any question and would have been happy with an apology and some acknowledgement from a manager but now having thought about the whole situation £5 wasn t good enough & neither was the service provided I am disgusted. I was a loyal sainsburys shopper  but I now highly doubt I will return with the frustration I ve now got with the company.";2016-03-12T17:02:57+0000;10154628635029377_10154628650144377;88050c90e817a8d3098df247e03daa2f2498871d;0;Dartmouth store;2016-03-12T17:06:33+0000;0

It sounds like you need to reconsider your policies though and not blame the store! I don't want my shopping to be like date Russian roulette or check every date on 41 items either. I'm sure you know from customer research that poorly dated items is a key metric in customer choice. If this were to happen again I'd shop at Asda or Tesco until it happens there.;2016-03-12T11:25:15+0000;0

Do you think it is reasonable to expect people to do this? I would have expected you to take into account the reasonableness of consuming an item on the day, especially if you have it on multi buy and highlight if it is going out of date (by reducing or similar). Whilst Salisbury's is my preferred supermarket  I get the impression Asda are much better at this than you.;2016-03-12T11:13:12+0000;0

I have been told today when I finally got through to speak to your customer services that I was not entitled to the voucher as below as although my the shops had been ORDERED in February the last one was DELIVERED in March . The offer stated three orders in February and I believe that it was in the terms and conditions that it said that the orders had to be delivered in February. Why could your offer have not used both words? I made a real effort to make these three orders.  I have been a sainsburys customer for years and spent thousands and thousands of pounds with you. I do not accept this and feel that the statement   three orders in February   is deliberately misleading when you could have just as easily said three DELIVERIES in February. You may have misled a lot of people with this  not just myself.  So I was offered tonight a £20  goodwill voucher  instead. I declined it. I asked to speak to a manager who basically said that I had to read the terms and conditions. The operative could not generate anything more than £20. He said his manager had left  then that his manager was just going into a meeting. I was not offered a call back from the manager. He stated the the offer WAS for three orders in February. I felt sorry for him. When I made my order on the 28th there was no delivery available on the 29th else I would have chosen it.

To use a Religious symbol of the Cross Bun then stuff it with Bacon is offensive and I would hope that the advertisement would be cancelled or a non-meat filling be a replacement. I would also expect an apology to be made to all who share my conviction.;2016-03-11T17:16:19+0000;10154622831194377_10154629926419377;d060c21ede42e7f91b5486679e9604f0487666a1;0;Then don't eat them.....;2016-03-12T22:12:42+0000;0

No other petrol station pumps have caused damage to my car (EVER) so the term 'fit for purpose' springs to mind.  I am very disappointed to get such a dismissive response from what appears to be a superficial glance over the evidence.  If you wanted proof of the damage and you didnt believe me, you mearly had to view the camera evidence or look at the damage to my car in correlation with the handle of the pump. But i was only worth a quick fob off.

They do this sort of thing all the time, often the patient is unaware that the Dr has made a mistake . I work in a pharmacy and phone the surgery all the time to get error's on prescriptions sorted, and sadly the Dr are often unaware of their mistakes until they are pointed out, and there is no come back on the Dr, but if the pharmacist dispenses the medication they are part responsible even if they have no medical history of the patient. The funding for pharmacies  has just been cut again so more will close. Use your pharmacy they are a valuable tool in the NHS;2016-03-13T13:30:12+0000;5

I queried it in store when collecting my items and the customer service couldn t understand and offered to call for me but I thought I could email and resolve the issue myself. How wrong was I!!  2.5weeks later and frequent emails from me to your customer service  the issue had to be sent to the IT team to investigate.... Now the latest is I can have an online voucher for the amount I was overcharged as unable to process a refund to my card??   This is an appealing service from a large company like sainsburys and when I contacted you the issue should have been immediately rectified and my card refunded with the amount you overcharged me!!;2016-03-10T17:55:37+0000;10154619321269377_10154619432194377;pageowner;0;Very sorry about that Kirsty, I can certainly understand your frustration.

For a couple of weeks now I have been trying to renew her delivery pass. I have done as advised and deleted the payment card and re added it into her account. The orders are accepted for the groceries but not for the pass renewal. Customer Service want her to phone up and order a pass over the phone. As she is hard of hearing this is not possible. Her shopping is due to arrive tomorrow and it looks like I will have to cancel the order and re order from Asda.

I ve even asked staff with no success.  Add onto this that we saw they were in stock online and placed an online order. Yes  we don t normally shop with sainsburys but for someone from payments to talk to my partner Michelle condescendingly about the use of a prepaid card (becuase you don t price match subs) was a little off. It s turns out that we had to return £6 worth of subs anyway. The driver was not friendly either.  I was a long standing sainsburys customer whilst living in plymouth and so far my experience of Northampton has not met the high customer service standards I expect from sainsburys. This shop on a prepaid card was exploratory to see what your service would be like.  So together with constant incorrect information on Linda Macartney  products and this shop  I don t think we ll be going back.

So I go into my local Sainsbury yesterday and not only did I have a lovely chat with the cashier  she also wrapped my glass cup in paper wrapping which I then used to help light my log burner later in the day  she also put the chicken wings into a correct size plastic bag which I then used by putting the wings and rather spicy marinade in to mix it all up.  Well done Sainsbury for putting the customer first.;2016-03-10T06:50:49+0000;10154617985544377_10154618279519377;pageowner;0;Hi Karen, I'm happy you had such a good experience in our store and also managed to find a good use for the wrapping and bags.

I am seriously considering shopping elsewhere from now on. I am a single parent on a tight budget  whilst I appreciate the brand match scheme  what is the point of it if I cannot use the coupon? I do my  big  shop monthly online as I don t drive but cannot afford to pay for weekly delivery. I received a brand match coupon for £2.57 but can only use it online  I therefore am missing out on this coupon because it runs out before my next online shop. I explained this to your live chat team but they simply said there was nothing they could do. As a Sainsbury s shopper for as long as I remember I feel very unvalued as a customer and feel that I may as well shop elsewhere as my loyalty clearly isn t valued. As Asda is cheaper by so much perhaps I should shop there instead? £2.57 is a significant amount to someone like me on a tight budget 😞;2016-03-09T15:34:29+0000;10154615926974377_10154618460289377;62a95542188a3c83a75183a41244e11cb4387c3e;0;Jenni Hill (Sinclair is my maiden name);2016-03-10T11:32:32+0000;0

Whilst in there we decided to have lunch in the café. When  our food arrived I asked for some children s cutlery as this was an impromptu lunch and I hadn t bought any with mr. I was informed they had some cutlery they could use and this was bought out to us. It was rather chunky but better than nothing. Whilst we were eating our food my 3 year old started to cry. It turned out she had cut her thumb on the knife which she had been given whilst cutting a chip. It was a small cut but it was bleeding a lot so my husband asked a member of staff for a plaster. The member of staff called for a first aider who treated her thumb and filled out the accident book. The member of staff told me my children had been given cutlery that was for disabled customers and although they have children s cutlery in the café they don t know where it is. The knife I realised was particularly sharp  sharper than your normal cutlery and although maybe I should have checked it it should never have been given to a child.   Someone from Sainsburys attempted to call me a few days later  I was out and my husband spoke to the female who refused to speak with him and she said she  would call back - which she hasn t! I am very disappointed with this and the fact there has been no follow up. I am sure my children are not the only children who use your café and require children s cutlery.

The member of staff called for a first aider who treated her thumb and filled out the accident book. The member of staff told me my children had been given cutlery that was for disabled customers and although they have children s cutlery in the café they don t know where it is. The knife I realised was particularly sharp  sharper than your normal cutlery and although maybe I should have checked it it should never have been given to a child.   Someone from Sainsburys attempted to call me a few days later  I was out and my husband spoke to the female who refused to speak with him and she said she  would call back - which she hasn t! I am very disappointed with this and the fact there has been no follow up. I am sure my children are not the only children who use your café and require children s cutlery.  I look forward to hearing from you.

I wouldn't be so bothered if it was my husband or I who had cut themselves however my daughter is 3 and this incident should have been followed up. Thank you.;2016-03-09T14:53:08+0000;0

Today I came to the store in utter desperation as my exhaust had fallen off my car  I had my 5 month old little girl in tow and had forgotten my phone. I was 16 miles away from home so really was stuck! I had no idea where the local garages were so  I went into store to ask to use their phone!  The amazingly kind lady called Donna at the customer service desk was more than happy to help a very upset young mother  not only did she let me use the phone  she sat me down  gave me a cup of tea and said she was going to arrange me help. She arranged for four very helpful men to come and zip tie my exhaust back on so I could drive to the nearest garage which they directed me to! I can t express in words how thankful I am and I hope this message gets to Donna and the other staff that helped me in my time of need! I will be certainly be shopping in Sainsburys more often!

I witnessed more than 20 whole loafs of bread and cakes being dumped in a bag that where perfectly ok to be eaten ready for the bin! There are plenty of people who are less fortunate who could hugely benefit from this food and would like to know what you are going to do to not only stop food wastage but also help local people.

I had a call from your delivery drinker at 7.10pm asking if I wanted my shopping earlier but we were out of he area so had to decline. We were stuck in traffic and at 8pm the Grindr rang and I explained that we would be home in less than 5 minutes - he told me he couldn t wait as he needed to be elsewhere. When I asked what time he would be delivering my shipping he informed me that it would not be that day and to await s call from the store on the morning. This was unacceptable and I complained to customer service regarding this. I was assured that the river would return that evening and deliver  he never showed up. On ringing customer service again  the manager of the store said that the driver was clicking off at 10 so again  I wouldn t be receiving my shopping that night. On Monday my shopping was delivered. Yesterday morning I received and email saying that my shopping had been cancelled and they the cost of my shopping was being refunded back to my bank account. Another call to customer services shed absolutely no light on this  even the store couldn t give me an explanation (I am still waiting for a call back from the store?!).

The sign is essentially a metal bar supported by chains. It states on the bar vehicles must be under 7ft 6 to enter. However the actual clearance height is more like 8ft 6 under this bar. As you exit from the car park in the next aisle the barrier is actually at 7ft 6. This is where the confusion is. The bus driver it would appear did not know how tall his vehicle is and our entry sign is at the wrong height, but the correct height is written on it. We have logged for this to be adjusted.

I (with my full shopping trolley) walked back behind the bus to tell the drivers of cars behind to backup and stop other cars from entering the aisle. Really?

I was in shopping with my unsettled four month old and visited the cafe where staff offered straight away to carry my tray for me. After that we went to do our shop but little one had explosive nappy and needed changed  staff at customer services took my trolley and looked after it while I got little one changed. I went back to finish my shopping with little one in arms and when I went to the tills the male cashier could see I was struggling as little one wouldn t be set down and called another member of staff to unpack my trolley.  The member of staff unpacking my trolley seemed to be a till supervisor who then called not one but two members of staff to pack my bags. I was so grateful I nearly cried  exemplary customer service and the staff deserve recognition for all they did yesterday. Those small acts of kindness made such a difference to me.

By law if the food has begun to defrost after a fridge or freezer breakdown and cannot be placed back in another freezer or fridge if it is chilled.   The food would have to be cooked within 30 minutes if it is not stored back within storage temperatures. Also it isn't always easy to store in another fridge or freezer elsewhere as there is food segregation rules to be followed. It's law and not just Sainsbury's policies. It's a food safety risk and could be a very expensive risk at that. Same reason why returns on chilled and frozen meats aren't allowed.;2016-03-09T00:43:17+0000;2

I do believe I have already provided sufficient information to locate this supervisor. However, for clarity, he was a middle-aged gentleman working at the Sainsbury’s store in Piccadilly Station, Manchester around 8:30pm on Monday 8th March.  I was not made aware of being able to show a bank statement, but this would not have provided 100% proof seeing as it would only have shown the total amount spent. I would have thought an un-touched bunch in their original ‘Taste the Difference’ packaging with a best before date two days in the future would be ample proof – would you not agree?  Anyway, I hope your reply is actually followed through and is not one which gives the impression that something is being done simply because it’s been raised so publicly on your social channels. It will be interesting to hear why he had such an issue with exchanging these £2 grapes.;2016-03-08T12:24:36+0000;0

I did not get his name but he was  supervising  at 20:35 this evening (7th March). He made me feel like the decayed rotting fruit was a result of something I had done and made me feel like I was trying to fiddle Sainsbury s over £2!!!! I was polite yet firm  despite feeling frustrated at his poor customer service  and informed him that I would be reluctant to shop in Sainsbury s again - his response was  good . He did eventualy exchange the grapes. Anyway  I think you need to educate this  supervisor  on how to deliver good customer service.;2016-03-07T21:01:50+0000;10154611021614377_10154612619624377;c275c50bb6bd26939099f53027a72c6b71bef2b7;1;Sainsbury's - Hello Laura, that is very kind of you, however I do not currently have a Nectar card.  I have only recently started to get most of my weekly shop from Sainsbury's having moved away from a rival supermarket which I had used for over a decade.  Your goodwill gesture is appreciated but there is no need for financial compensation - I just wanted to raise this issue as, working in commerce myself, I feel customer service should always be at the forefront.  It is clear to me now that my experience here is unsual for Sainsbury's and I am happy to leave it at that knowing this will be investigated. Thank you.;2016-03-08T12:51:29+0000;0

While using the self service checkout they had an issue scanning a money off coupon. A man whoworks there came over to assist. He gave them really bad attitude and snapped ho he d watched them doing wrong. When they pointed out they had pressed the correct buttons hesaid he didn t see that. The coupon wouldn t scan for him either. He s excuse for the attitude he gave them was he s not good at customer service. They went to the customer service desk after as they felt the matter needed highlighting. Specially as he works with customers yet can t do customer service onlytoget oh ok.

Me and my husband popped into sainsburys in Lincoln to pick up a few bits with our two small children. Our 3 year old struggles in supermarkets  so sitting in the main bit of the trolley  while our daughter was in the baby seat  he had a melt down as soon as we got in the door. We reached the fridge section before his meltdown became too much and we couldn t calm him down. we were about to turn and leave when a colleague (sally) who was putting reduced stickers on some meat came over and gave him some blank stickers. He instantly calmed down and started playing with the stickers. She then presented him with a little toy that has lights and sounds and from that second we didn t hear any sound from him  he sat contented in the trolley while me and my husband could get some shopping. Her small gesture of taking some time out of her work to offer comfort to our son meant we could do our shopping and have a nice experience. It really meant a lot to us.

They can put 3 bottles of beer which are quite heavy into one bag but a pair of rubber gloves, a small packet of ham, 6 hot cross buns, a pack of 3 cat milk all needed their own individual bags! I will recycle the bags by giving them to the local farm shop so no harm done and I still have the 19 from last week if I need any at home, it is just a waste and not ethical in my opinion.

Awoke this morning  popped downstairs for a morning cuppa  opened the refrigeration door to be faced with 4 pints of your finest making its way towards me as the bottle had a hole in the bottom.  Picture the scene of a milk waterfall  whilst not altogether unattractive  it s not what you need at 6:30 in the morning.  As the milk had nowhere to go when leaking it just filled the fridge and I found button mushrooms and a loose courgette floating around  a chicken in a now milk sauce and a cheesecake that was minding its own business now taking on the look of a milk pudding.  An hour of clearing up ensued and a set of superman pyjamas now have a distinct scent of sour milk  needless to say my partner has given me a wide berth this morning as a consequence.  You have changed the quality of your milk bottles and they are so thin.

The RSPO is a global initiative which encourages palm oil production in a way that helps to reduce deforestation, promotes biodiversity and respects the livelihoods of rural communities. Growers who meet the RSPO standard must be audited and certified by an independent body to show they have, amongst other things, not deforested primary rainforest or destroyed areas of high biodiversity. Certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) is then sourced through approved segregated or mass balance (‘mixed’) supply chains to reach our products. Debs;2016-03-05T21:58:19+0000;0

It is a well documented problem that was hoped would be rectified when the new rebuild was done.   They should have had separate roads for exit and entry for which they had capacity to do so.   A lot of customers complain about this and the Hotel next door is getting very annoyed with their  car park being used  They have gone to the extent of placing signs in the hotel car park and also speaking to Sainsbury's as well. Alas it seems to be following on deaf ears. .;2016-03-05T21:39:41+0000;0

Not from my point of views but people asking staff where is this ""oh it's discontinued"" as I walked passed mentioned like everything else. So from the products I buy, no no added sugar sainsburys black currant it's clearly the sugar or no alternative. No bistro best veg gravy, yes sod the veggies, no sainsburys skin nourish bath wash in white, no children's listerine mouth was, if you don't like Colgate you are stuffed. So on a Friday night 2 people looking around the clothes, extra members of staff eagerly awaiting their delivery of clothes! Seriously sainsburys have you thought this one through? Think about the product lines you have discontinued and the amount of clothes you will sell, seriously it must have been a man that decided this! Your staff are having to deal with angry shoppers, put the store back to normal otherwise get a bigger one to expand your choice other than reduce it. It was quieter on Friday shoppers do so with their feet. Surely it common sense and a no brainer unless you work in management at sainsburys of course 😆😆😆😆😆 oh and to add In a few months I will be asking under the freedom of information act how many products you have discontinued and how much profit you have made on the clothes, clearly I already know the answer 😂;2016-03-12T18:10:23+0000;0

We had done an online shop and via ‘click and collect’ had arranged to collect our goods between the hours of 5:30 and 6:30pm from the Chester store last night (although we know it is picked and delivered from your Cheshire Oaks store). At about 5:15 we got a call from a young man (I believe he was called Simon) to advise that due to staff sickness you had no drivers available to deliver our shopping and  if we really needed our groceries we would need to go and collect them from the Ellesmere Port store.   Getting to the Ellesmere Port store was going to be a bit of a problem for us at such short notice so Simon advised he could get our groceries to Chester much later in the evening  probably about 9pm. We took him up on this offer and Simon arranged to call us 15 minutes before he was due to arrive in Chester. He offered a home delivery for us but as we live in the middle of nowhere we decided to go and pick it up from the collect point as most of the time drivers get lost and we end up spending longer explaining where we live than it takes to get to the Sainsbury’s store.  I arrived at the Sainsbury’s Chester ‘click and collect’ point at about 9pm and the van was not there  I sat in the pouring down rain and freezing cold for a couple of minutes until a small car  packed with Sainsbury’s shopping pulled up next to me. Out of the passenger seat rose our knight in burgundy armour (I’m not sure what colour your fleeces are so I’ve gone with burgundy) Simon  who began unpacking our shopping from the boot of the car and started packing it into mine.   I questioned Simon on the lack of company van and it’s then when he told me he had brought the shopping to us out of the goodness of his heart. As there were no vans and no drivers  he had packed our shopping into his girlfriend’s car and got his girlfriend to bring him to Chester for the sole purpose of getting us our shopping. He even advised he was a couple of minutes later than expected because just before leaving the Cheshire Oaks store he checked over our shopping and noticed something was missing and he ran back into the store to get it. I was truly gobsmacked. What a hero.  It doesn’t matter where you go  you don’t see customer service like that anymore.  Please can you pass on my thanks to Simon (and his girlfriend) for their effort? They are both true examples of not just great staff but of great people in general and as such I hope Sainsbury’s can reward both Simon and his girlfriend for caring so much about the company and its reputation.  Our thanks once again to both of them  Ben and Clair;2016-03-04T08:49:36+0000;10154601721229377_10155437708284377;f076768b9408e2e579b136d90e305a09bd831ae0;1;Hope you compensate him.

We had done an online shop and via ‘click and collect’ had arranged to collect our goods between the hours of 5:30 and 6:30pm from the Chester store last night (although we know it is picked and delivered from your Cheshire Oaks store). At about 5:15 we got a call from a young man (I believe he was called Simon) to advise that due to staff sickness you had no drivers available to deliver our shopping and  if we really needed our groceries we would need to go and collect them from the Ellesmere Port store.   Getting to the Ellesmere Port store was going to be a bit of a problem for us at such short notice so Simon advised he could get our groceries to Chester much later in the evening  probably about 9pm. We took him up on this offer and Simon arranged to call us 15 minutes before he was due to arrive in Chester. He offered a home delivery for us but as we live in the middle of nowhere we decided to go and pick it up from the collect point as most of the time drivers get lost and we end up spending longer explaining where we live than it takes to get to the Sainsbury’s store.  I arrived at the Sainsbury’s Chester ‘click and collect’ point at about 9pm and the van was not there  I sat in the pouring down rain and freezing cold for a couple of minutes until a small car  packed with Sainsbury’s shopping pulled up next to me. Out of the passenger seat rose our knight in burgundy armour (I’m not sure what colour your fleeces are so I’ve gone with burgundy) Simon  who began unpacking our shopping from the boot of the car and started packing it into mine.   I questioned Simon on the lack of company van and it’s then when he told me he had brought the shopping to us out of the goodness of his heart. As there were no vans and no drivers  he had packed our shopping into his girlfriend’s car and got his girlfriend to bring him to Chester for the sole purpose of getting us our shopping. He even advised he was a couple of minutes later than expected because just before leaving the Cheshire Oaks store he checked over our shopping and noticed something was missing and he ran back into the store to get it. I was truly gobsmacked. What a hero.  It doesn’t matter where you go  you don’t see customer service like that anymore.

I arrived at the Sainsbury’s Chester ‘click and collect’ point at about 9pm and the van was not there  I sat in the pouring down rain and freezing cold for a couple of minutes until a small car  packed with Sainsbury’s shopping pulled up next to me. Out of the passenger seat rose our knight in burgundy armour (I’m not sure what colour your fleeces are so I’ve gone with burgundy) Simon  who began unpacking our shopping from the boot of the car and started packing it into mine.   I questioned Simon on the lack of company van and it’s then when he told me he had brought the shopping to us out of the goodness of his heart. As there were no vans and no drivers  he had packed our shopping into his girlfriend’s car and got his girlfriend to bring him to Chester for the sole purpose of getting us our shopping. He even advised he was a couple of minutes later than expected because just before leaving the Cheshire Oaks store he checked over our shopping and noticed something was missing and he ran back into the store to get it. I was truly gobsmacked. What a hero.  It doesn’t matter where you go  you don’t see customer service like that anymore.  Please can you pass on my thanks to Simon (and his girlfriend) for their effort? They are both true examples of not just great staff but of great people in general and as such I hope Sainsbury’s can reward both Simon and his girlfriend for caring so much about the company and its reputation.

We had done an online shop and via ‘click and collect’ had arranged to collect our goods between the hours of 5:30 and 6:30pm from the Chester store last night (although we know it is picked and delivered from your Cheshire Oaks store). At about 5:15 we got a call from a young man (I believe he was called Simon) to advise that due to staff sickness you had no drivers available to deliver our shopping and  if we really needed our groceries we would need to go and collect them from the Ellesmere Port store.

We had done an online shop and via ‘click and collect’ had arranged to collect our goods between the hours of 5:30 and 6:30pm from the Chester store last night (although we know it is picked and delivered from your Cheshire Oaks store). At about 5:15 we got a call from a young man (I believe he was called Simon) to advise that due to staff sickness you had no drivers available to deliver our shopping and  if we really needed our groceries we would need to go and collect them from the Ellesmere Port store.   Getting to the Ellesmere Port store was going to be a bit of a problem for us at such short notice so Simon advised he could get our groceries to Chester much later in the evening  probably about 9pm. We took him up on this offer and Simon arranged to call us 15 minutes before he was due to arrive in Chester. He offered a home delivery for us but as we live in the middle of nowhere we decided to go and pick it up from the collect point as most of the time drivers get lost and we end up spending longer explaining where we live than it takes to get to the Sainsbury’s store.  I arrived at the Sainsbury’s Chester ‘click and collect’ point at about 9pm and the van was not there  I sat in the pouring down rain and freezing cold for a couple of minutes until a small car  packed with Sainsbury’s shopping pulled up next to me. Out of the passenger seat rose our knight in burgundy armour (I’m not sure what colour your fleeces are so I’ve gone with burgundy) Simon  who began unpacking our shopping from the boot of the car and started packing it into mine.   I questioned Simon on the lack of company van and it’s then when he told me he had brought the shopping to us out of the goodness of his heart. As there were no vans and no drivers  he had packed our shopping into his girlfriend’s car and got his girlfriend to bring him to Chester for the sole purpose of getting us our shopping. He even advised he was a couple of minutes later than expected because just before leaving the Cheshire Oaks store he checked over our shopping and noticed something was missing and he ran back into the store to get it. I was truly gobsmacked. What a hero.  It doesn’t matter where you go  you don’t see customer service like that anymore.

Why on earth does your company think that every mother - aka a grown woman - wants to receive a sickly  sentimental  glittery  cutesy  schmaltzy and PINK card?! There wasn’t a single card that didn’t fall into those categories  or a combination of some/all of them. My a-whiff-away-from-70 year old mother has never been any of those things and neither has her daughter or son; so why do you - or the card manufacturers - assume that we want to send that type of card to our mother  year in  year out  or that she wants to receive something like that?  What happened to all the other colours of the universe? What happened to other designs? What about those of us who by nature aren’t metaphorically covered in glitter and wear Princess crowns with butterflies whilst we glide around on a bed of perfection? What about sass  humour  blank cards  even spikiness  that reflects the real and varying relationships we have with our mothers? Why in the 21st century - and at all ages of womanhood - are women still mainly being defined by this sickly  glittery  candy floss pinkness when it comes to choosing a special occasion card to say what we feel about the women in our lives and to celebrate all that is wonderful about us?  The Customer Service Operator I spoke with at the store told me that you have no control over your card selection  that it’s done by an outside contractor. I find it hard to believe that Sainsbury’s doesn’t have the power to define what is sold in its stores  that it cannot request variety and diversity in its cards. I’m not the only person for whom your stores are the only option for card purchases due to varying constraints from disability to time.

Why on earth does your company think that every mother - aka a grown woman - wants to receive a sickly  sentimental  glittery  cutesy  schmaltzy and PINK card?! There wasn’t a single card that didn’t fall into those categories  or a combination of some/all of them. My a-whiff-away-from-70 year old mother has never been any of those things and neither has her daughter or son; so why do you - or the card manufacturers - assume that we want to send that type of card to our mother  year in  year out  or that she wants to receive something like that?  What happened to all the other colours of the universe? What happened to other designs? What about those of us who by nature aren’t metaphorically covered in glitter and wear Princess crowns with butterflies whilst we glide around on a bed of perfection?

On entering the store she was followed in very close proximity for the whole of her shop by the store security guard to the point she was made to feel extremely upset and anxious drawing the understandable conclusion he assumed she was a shoplifter. Naturally she was mortified that such an assumption could be made. She was so upset she raised this with the person identified as the manager in the store and was upset even more with the attitude that she was dealt with. The manager refused to acknowledge her feelings and proceeded to upset her even more to the point where she was brought to tears. The managers attitude simply reinforced her belief that they believed her to be a potential shoplifter and the actions of the guard were justified. Clearly this incident has been enormously upsetting for my wife who finds the implication of shoplifting to be utterly incomprehensible and what I simply cannot understand is how Sainsbury s employ staff that are allowed to refuse to acknowledge how a customer has been made to feel by the treatment they have received in their store. Clearly your organisation does not care how your customers are made to feel by your staff and are happy for judgements to be made about customers with absolutely no reason. This is clearly an enormous fail in respect of the treatment of customers and I encourage anyone that doesn t want to be on the receiving end of similar treatment to stay well away.;2016-03-03T19:04:48+0000;10154600315314377_10154600436329377;pageowner;0;Sorry about this Steve, I can understand your frustration.

Could this be the same  delivery driver had an incident yesterday that was also reported to yourselves??? An item worth £120 was supposed to deliver to my house yesterday that never actually got delivered! When calling you to find out where it was you said the item had been cancelled and you would investigate -  although it was never cancelled. Then you said it had actually been delivered and signed for yet you couldn t explain who it was that signed for the item when this was requested as there was only one person in the house who had stayed in especially for this delivery.  Apparently  the item was  signed for  and as this was the case you would not be providing a refund or the item to actually be delivered to my home. Told that an eldery woman signed for this at the delivery address and said it was for her daughter .. this could not be the case as no  eldery  ladies were at this address and no one had even knocked the door.

I am loosing my faith in Sainsbury s quality. We recently purchased your own brand four slice toaster from the Doncaster branch which after a few weeks went defective as the toast did not pop up at the end of the cycle. Then my wife made an online order which was delivered on 27/02/16  the next day the Parsnips she ordered were out of date and then on 29/02/16 the bag of Green Beans that did not expire until 03/03/16 were mouldy and had a dead bug in amongst them. We took the beans and the toaster back to Doncaster yesterday  recieved a refund on the beans and exchanged the toaster for a Morphy Richards one sa we did not trust the Sainsbury s brand  this however cost us £15.00 more to buy. Whilest we were in store we did some shopping  one of the items we purchased was a 6 pack of Sainsbury s Taste the Difference Buttermilk Crumpets that were on reduction. I opened the pack today to toast two each for my wife and myself. One of the crumpets felt damp which I thought was strange and looked different to the others as it had no small holes in it but I thought this is Sainsbury s but on eating the said crumpet I found that it had only been partially cooked at the manufacturers and was basically dough. The other five were not much better infact I ate one that tasted OK but the two I had toasted for my wife she refused as she said they tasted sour.

I was offered an e-voucher to cover the cost but when I said I d prefer a refund I was put on hold and was eventually spoken to by a very abrupt colleague who just asked for my card number  no customer service or anything. When I said  is that it?   He replied rudely  yes that s it  and when I started to speak he again  he just kept repeating  goodbye  as I was clearly too inconvenient for him.

It is passed the delivery time and there is no sign or sound of a delivery. We ve had no contact from the driver  all your customer service lines are now closed so I cannot contact anyone (not that I should have to). Both me and my partner have work first thing in the morning  and by first thing I mean my partner has to leave at 6am so I don t even know if we should stay up to see if the delivery is coming or if we should just assume that we are going to have nothing to eat tomorrow! I am outraged and appalled. It is safe to say that if this matter is not handled quickly and in a way that is satisfactory to me then I will be taking my business elsewhere and never recommending Sainsbury s.;2016-03-01T22:15:31+0000;10154595791169377_10154595850529377;pageowner;0;So sorry Iona!

We can't make any promises, however I can see that the store already stocks some of the KoKo products such as their dairy free milks, so this may be a high possibility for this store.
