I also told them not to ring that late as its my mans number but surprise they rang anyway. 3rd time I was told they would ring back in 5 mins as yet again person I spoke to didn't know how to deal with it but no suprise again it's now been an hour and no call. I'd say it was pretty simply the receipt you have says one price and the receipt you give me says different, so you refund the difference. I'd like to know how to take this further please as you were not authorised to take the cash out of my account and you clearly are not capable of dealing with it.

I have found it's the general trend of all your local stores, I don't live near any of your larger stores.  I live in Queens Park but travel from Paddington each day, where you have two locals there and one in Queen's Park and one on the Harrow Road, every single one is the same and I honestly can't get a decent bit of bread. It's annoying because I actually love your fresh bread and instead I have been just going to Tesco in the morning and evenings after work because theirs is always soft throughout the day.  Generally speaking, anything fresh next to a section specifically designed to retain freshness through chilling is never going to work.   Also something I've noticed as a trend in your stores is that the fridge/freezers stretch all around the bottom end of your stores so actually the design is just quite poor so no matter where you choose to put the bread it will always be near somewhere chilled. So surely they should be situated on one side of the store and not stretching all the way around. Plus it makes the whole shopping experience really quite cold.   Kind regards.;2016-11-01T08:29:52+0000;0

I am really impressed and wanted to take the time to say so.  The store was clean  well lit  with pleasant staff and the car park whilst small has been well designed and seems a good size for the store. However  I would expect all of the above as standard.   What really made the store stand out for me was the fantastic (and well thought out) range of items available. I feel that I would be able to do the majority (if not all) of my weekly shop within this store which is not something that can be said of your competitors smaller stores.

Yep, order number is 150584026. Account holder is me. It arrived at 7:50 last night, the delivery driver didn't even know he was late, I had to tell him! We also had no carrier bags despite paying for them, so had to take every item in individually. Just pretty shoddy. He said he couldn't refund the delivery fee himself. Please could you do so, and an offer of a voucher of some kind to cover the inconvenience wouldn't go amiss.;2016-10-31T16:28:00+0000;0

Freezer cabinet not working properly and the till manager/supervisor  trying to convince me otherwise  but three - yes 3 - Daim Bar Tarts later  all covered in frost when the box is opened  all resulting in a horrid mushy tart when defrosted.  Returned to store twice to try and sort this out without success.   Till supervisor still trying to claim the freezer is good  but ice covered cardboard is really not encouraging.  At the end of my tether  I opened the third box in store  in front of the till supervisor.  Tart covered in 2cm of frost.  Till supervisor still thinks you don t have a problem and bitches to colleague about having getting cold hands while I try and find a box not covered in ice. She refuses to check for any other stock but agrees I can exchange the previously defrosted and refrozen tart for something else.  (I only came here because I wanted this particular tart.)  So I exchange for anther dessert that I do not really want and I get charged the difference and walk out  being told by someone else that the supervisor was bitching to another colleague about getting cold.   Is this your typical customer service ?;2016-10-30T16:54:05+0000;10155383432564377_10155384102834377;pageowner;0;Hi Carolyn, very sorry about this.

We find it looks like this most visits (we are there 2 - 3 times a week) Being a Sunday you'd expect a wide range of fresh fish available as it's one of your busiest days but there wasn't a great choice in display. You really have consider making your whole display a lot more appealing to the eyes but as equally important, the fish has to look fresh with a wider range of stock. There is also a lack of customer interaction as the staff member today was also working the meat counter and in our opinion favored the meat over the fish. We saw customers who gave up and walked away.;2016-10-30T16:15:36+0000;0

Vegan mince, sausages, cheeses, nutritional yeast, cream, the list is endless. Pretty much the same as what is on offer to non vegans / vegetarians. Also just having the items in a clearly marked section would make shopping easier instead of having to pick up every single item to make sure it is vegan friendly.  Simple everyday things like bread, toothpaste, handcream. I'm sure I can say thank you from all us vegans in Thanet.;2016-10-30T17:03:57+0000;0

Bagshot Road in Bracknell have a sign on the display saying it's been discontinued and to try the cheese and meat aisle for alternatives!! Like a vegan is gonna go buy cheese & meat!! Or someone with a dairy allergy will just pop along and buy a block of cows milk cheese! Totally inappropriate signage!! I struggled to buy the cheeses because whenever I went in to get it the shelves were empty so they can't say there was no demand! They only had it in there for 3 or 4 weeks to so not very long to try each cheese. As you can tell I'm slightly annoyed!;2016-10-29T19:27:56+0000;1

They seemed to have little stock and only small display cabinet even though last year they went to storage out the back of the store (which took ages) but seemed to have stock. The man said about the offer of spending more than ¬£20 and get free firework set which is good but not when they don't have the fireworks you actually want in first place. This was Watford store on Dome roundabout. A shame as offers looked good and many of these offers may be better than other supermarkets. They said they would be getting a delivery but of course it's a wasted journey of they don't get what you want on that delivery as they didn't know what would be coming in.;2016-10-30T13:26:05+0000;0

Several items are under the weight stated on the bags the 900g bag of chips (Basics range) actually weigh in at 700g  Including the weight of the bag. What a waste of plastic  decent sized bag that is barely half full!  several products of poor quality in comparison to Tescos with a noticeable price difference (About ¬£10-¬£20 for my whole order) on the basics ranges and the product sizes are pretty poor (and in some cases totally falsely advertised  see chips example above!)

We've spoken to our buyer for the product and they advised us that; the price of butter changes constantly and has been at a low rate for the last 18 months. The price has risen since April due to lower milk production and a weak pound. Making British butter more appealing to European buyers, which has further reduced stocks and pushed up the price.

I ordered a package off eBay on Wednesday due for collection today. I hadn t heard anything about it being ready for collection so I thought I d pop down and see if it was there anyway. It was  great. But the lady couldn t give it to me as I hadn t received the code required for handover. She was very sympathetic and asked a colleague for help. The chap that came over was very defensive and aggressive towards me saying he won t do anything until I get an email. I then felt the need to apologise to the lady  Chantelle I think her name was  incase I had come across as aggravated to justify his attitude towards me. I called eBay up and they explained that I could indeed collect my parcel and that yourselves had to phone them via a direct line they supply. Your staff knew nothing of this! So I had to phone eBay back again and once I explained myself AGAIN to eBay  I had to pass my phone over to one of your members of staff. After 1 hour spent in your store I was finally allowed to get my parcel.  If your staff aren t trained on this system why do you offer it?! And the chap that got all aggressive and defensive with me had NO right as he clearly had no clue either!!!  Chantelle who dealt with me from the beginning and who spoke to the eBay staff member was fantastic and a real credit to your store. But my overall experience today has made me want to never step foot in that store again!

The store have got back to me and would like to pass on their apologies for this. They have advised that they will be highlighting your comments to the customer service manager to ensure the relevant colleagues are retrained in this area. My colleague Kevin - one of the managers in store, would be more than happy to meet with you next time you're in. Let me know if you'd like to do so. Chris.;2016-10-29T12:06:09+0000;0

I ordered a package off eBay on Wednesday due for collection today. I hadn t heard anything about it being ready for collection so I thought I d pop down and see if it was there anyway. It was  great. But the lady couldn t give it to me as I hadn t received the code required for handover. She was very sympathetic and asked a colleague for help. The chap that came over was very defensive and aggressive towards me saying he won t do anything until I get an email. I then felt the need to apologise to the lady  Chantelle I think her name was  incase I had come across as aggravated to justify his attitude towards me. I called eBay up and they explained that I could indeed collect my parcel and that yourselves had to phone them via a direct line they supply. Your staff knew nothing of this! So I had to phone eBay back again and once I explained myself AGAIN to eBay  I had to pass my phone over to one of your members of staff. After 1 hour spent in your store I was finally allowed to get my parcel.  If your staff aren t trained on this system why do you offer it?! And the chap that got all aggressive and defensive with me had NO right as he clearly had no clue either!!!

It arrived this morning and I m disappointed to tell you that two of the items have a use by of today  one has had the date changed to the 31st  the gammon has no readable use by and the cake has no date at all. I have frozen the gammon in the hope that it will be OK.   Sorry to say that I won t be doing a video of how things taste  because I am a little disappointed.   Please can your promotions team take a little more care when doing these things.  A warning to take note of the use by is one thing  but the same day is another.     Thanks though.;2016-10-28T09:07:19+0000;10155374778824377_10155375093754377;pageowner;0;Oh no, so sorry about that, Rowena. I've popped this over to the relevant people, we'll be back in touch ASAP.

The extra large box of washing powered I ordered because it was on sale was substituted for the box almost half the size but only ¬£1 less. Next time think about cost per kilo rather than brands! There were many better options that were much cheaper per kilo. I couldn t decline the substitute because I have washing that needs to be done. Also had very low quality pumpkin  and equally low quality little oranges. The quality of the fruit and veg I have delivered is an ongoing problem that I have contacted you about before.;2016-10-28T08:23:03+0000;10155374714254377_10155374755249377;pageowner;0;Hi, so we can look into this, could you Message us an order number, the account holder's name, email address and postcode?

Myself  my Husband and our children visited your Newhaven store at around 4.40pm. We were looking for a certain product (and failing to find it) when a member of your staff came up to us and asked if we needed help (I m afraid I didn t catch her name  but she had very distinctive braided hair with blue streaks in it) she took us straight to the product and noticed that my 5 year old daughter was absolutely mesmorised by said hair! She then began chatting away to my daughter about how she likes to dye her hair pretty colours and listened intently when my daughter was telling her about wanting rainbow hair (but Mummy said no)  She finished the conversation by giving my daughter a high 5 and asked us if we needed any futher assistance.  I would appreciate it if this post could be fed back to the store  as she deserves a little recognition for really good customer service.;2016-10-27T20:36:56+0000;10155373216234377_10155373405354377;pageowner;0;That's great Leeann!

I buy 5 packets of  40gr Sainsbury s minced turkey thighs every week.  Have done for years.   This morning as I picked up the first packet  I noticed the plastic packaging was considerably bigger than it had been in the past.   What a waste was my reaction.   When I got to the till to pay for it I commented on this fact to the check out lady.   She looked at the back of the packet and asked how much the old pack had weighed.   I replied 400gr.   This is only 350gr now she told me.  So Sainsburys are charging me ¬£4.00 for only 350gr of minced turkey and packing it in a larger plastic box presumably to pull the wool over my eyes.

If you you look at your mince site it is the first item on the left of row 5 - Sainsburys British Turkey Thigh Mince 4% Fat 800g ¬£4.00.   When I bought it last week that was the pack I bought, this week the packaging has changed, i.e. it is about 25% bigger (wasteful) the fat content is now 5% and the weight has been reduced to 750g - but the price remains the same i.e ¬£4.00.

The varieties grown for carvers and monsters are designed to grow large and be robust so that they can be carved. They are not the best tasting varieties. If customers would like to eat pumpkin we recommend our Edible pumpkin product. These are specially selected varieties which have higher levels of sugar and taste great.

Previous issues include out of date items and other missing items. To be fair to you, Sainsbury's have issued me with vouchers each time but I've still had the inconvenience of having to take time out to go to the shop and replace the items. That kind of defeats the point of online shopping and home delivery!;2016-10-27T08:05:29+0000;0

I was sat on the car park for over 20 minutes with a screaming toddler before my shopping turned up. I emailed sainsburys a few days later about all the things that were wrong with my order. I received an email saying that someone from the store would contact me. The letter was just a standard template and your representative didn t even fill in some of the information. 2 weeks since your email  I still have had no contact from sainsburys nor a refund from my returned substituted items. I am absolutely disgusted with Sainsburys customer services and have never received this lack of communication and customer care from your main competitor. To be completely honest it has put me off shopping wit sainsburys again. Can I have a refund on the products I returned 3 weeks ago please?

Our store is located next to a theme park and as it is half term they hosted a fireworks display. Due to the location of the cafe, this meant there were a lot of visitors who came for food and drinks while also observing the display. Unfortunately all of our tables were taken and I have been advised that they explained this to every customer and we also offered access to our Costa takeaway at our Petrol forecourt. Apologies once again for any inconvenience caused. Ryan.;2016-10-27T12:53:20+0000;1

He has advised me that what you have heard is not true and that the store would never limit items during the sale. I asked specifically about the Beatbo, and he advised stock has been extremely limited due to it's popularity and any units received have sold out the same day. I'm really sorry you were unable to get the specific item you were looking for. Unfortunately all products and offers are subject to availability while stocks last. Did you try any other stores in your area? Ryan.;2016-10-26T14:45:00+0000;0

First of all the staff on the fish/meat counter have become awful regarding customer service. The customers are left waiting quite a while  usually until they have finished their own conversations. I think  smiles  are last season as well. The original staff this year were lovely! Always remembered regular customers and constantly enthusiastic.  Secondly  I have made several requests regarding the store stocking more dairy free items. Such as your gary and vegan quorn products. I have been met with vacant expressions and uninterested staff. Who tell me to either travel 10/20miles to other stores to see if they have the products or just shop on line. That s it...end of conversation! I work 12 hour shifts in a hospital and quite frankly don t then want to drive a huge round trip just to get my shopping when there is a store around the corner from my house! I m allergic to dairy so really need dairy free alternatives. I have been buying the dribs and drabs that you do stock and making do. Until I walked into the local Tesco today  whom have doubled their fridge dairy free offerings. With a wide variety of products  most of which were close to selling out. Which shows there is demand for it! The store manager informed me that ranges would continue to expand over the coming months as well. So if Tesco are happily doing it why is there no sign of Sainsbury s bothering? There less than a mile difference between the stores in Bourne so I shall now be frequenting Tesco I think. üòï;2016-10-25T19:19:02+0000;10155366166494377_10155368823994377;edad670732983f5a339dd801cfdea77aa972917d;1;Hi Robbie, it's happened on 3 occasions regarding dairy free stuff, with the latest being last week.

Not sure if it's local news or what but I found it very annoying that people are so easily offended these days. I mean seriously if you check out the costumes they created throughout history you'd see some really disturbing stuff. Sadly I don't have the product code. It was a creepy little number with the ribcage hanging out covered in insects & maggots  (yes we take our halloween very seriously in this house) it made a noise & came with a scary pumpkin mask. So cute & scary! üòÄ;2016-10-25T16:23:03+0000;1

I won't buy it in our local store though, not after the new Night Club doorman from South London started as the car park attendant. He appears to not understand customer care. There have been a succession of car park attendants that have some delusions of importance and no expertise in dealing with people and we have witnessed a number of heated exchanges in the car park and the store followed by no attendant for a while. It was my turn last week. My wife has continued using the store for her cigarettes and newspapers only, after a member of staff was downright rude to me and I refuse to use the store. I complained to Head Office who put the complaint back to the local store to deal with. They supported the member of staff. This despite that member of staff having a reputation for being rude and abrupt amongst the staff and customers. My wife now gets her cigarettes and newspapers elsewhere.

I have 1 year old twins but never want to run the risk of going down to find there s no trolleys to put my babies in.

We used to grow hyacinth and make shoe boxes full of festive cheer and staples to help when the need for heating was stronger than the need for food.  Now as an adult I would like to continue this age old tradition and I am now looking for some help to give as many elderly people in my local area a little bit of ease and maybe for a minute forget the worry of food and heating costs. Would you be willing to support my cause and be able to pledge some help towards the people who grew us and our country and now need us to make their lives just that little bit easier.;2016-10-23T21:57:26+0000;10155359535559377_10155361054539377;pageowner;0;Hi Sarah, if you visit your local store & request to speak with their PR ambassador.

It's a shame a small minority has tried to ruin that for others. I  wholly appreciate your concern so I've forwarded this feedback on to the buying team to be reviewed.

I bought a 10 pack of boys briefs for my 6 year old  they were in the sale so more reasonably priced than normal. The pack was a size 9 to 10 year old size  my son has a lot of junk in his trunk so I always size up to spare everyone the horror of his cheeks escaping.  I get them home  and show them to him   they are awesome  he tells me. This morning  he opens up the packet and pulls on a pair. They are very snug. VERY snug. So I check the size and the label inside the pants says 6 to 7 year old size. He refused to take them off until bedtime too. He likes how they feel. He s autistic and sensory stuff makes his world happy. I m not sure what to do now? Do I return the whole pack including the worn pair (washed of course) or just the 9 unworn pairs? I m happy to exchange for the correct size if possible please.   I would normally check the size in store before buying but I had my 18 month old with me and I wanted to finish my shop quickly.

So I check the size and the label inside the pants says 6 to 7 year old size. He refused to take them off until bedtime too. He likes how they feel. He s autistic and sensory stuff makes his world happy. I m not sure what to do now? Do I return the whole pack including the worn pair (washed of course) or just the 9 unworn pairs? I m happy to exchange for the correct size if possible please.   I would normally check the size in store before buying but I had my 18 month old with me and I wanted to finish my shop quickly.  Also I m not sure what I ve done with my receipt  I ll try the depths of my bag but it maybe gone.

An old human man pokes his head round the curtain. He gets an eyeful of you and waggles his eyebrows to the camera. You do a B-Movie scream, hands up to your face in horror and run out of fitting room, still in state of undress. He looks at camera, rubs his hands together and starts to chase you around the store.

I'll get this feedback logged so we can reconsider the playlist in future. The original recording of ""Yakety Sax"" is a pop-jazz instrumental from 1963. Comedian Benny Hill later made it more widely known as the theme music of The Benny Hill Show in November of 1969. So although the show itself may have unsavory connotations, the song was a much liked jazz piece prior to being used on the show. Thanks again for letting us know your thoughts on this though, we'll take your comments on board. Steve.;2016-10-24T08:43:42+0000;5

As we were driving home yesterday lunch time we decided to treat ourselves by shopping at Sainsbury‚Äôs (yes we view shopping at Sainsbury‚Äôs as a treat). We went in with our 2 year old son and thought let‚Äôs push the boat out and have lunch in your cafe. When we ordered the food we were told there would be a 20 minute wait which was fine  our son can manage 20 minutes of waiting! Unfortunately  when it got to 45 minutes  and everyone around us (including people who arrived after us) were getting their food and leaving  our experience had gone from a treat to stressful. Our son was a star but started to get inpatient and hungry so we asked a Sainsbury lady how long our food would be? She came back and told us our order was next  only for us to watch another table be served (they‚Äôd been there for considerably less time than us). Our food came and we ate quickly because we were all hungry and ready to get on with our Saturday afternoon. We left your store feeling stressed  disappointed and we just wanted to get out as soon as possible. We would have gone to you costumer service but we felt we‚Äôd wasted enough time in store and felt it was unfair on our son to ask him to wait again.;2016-10-23T12:28:21+0000;10155357782264377_10155357860089377;pageowner;0;Oh dear, I'm really sorry Joanne.

There was a couple already being served so we didn t think we would be long.  Bad mistake.  The lady on the till was scanning the items really slowly  then constantly stopping and having a conversation with the couple.  I don t mind people having conversations  but not when they have stopped working to have them and a queue is forming at the till.  When she finally got to serve us  there was no apology for having to wait.  We often use the near by Aldi at trent vale and never have to wait long at the tills and the staff work quickly on the tills.  Perhaps having to wait long at the tills is one way of making people to use the self service tills.  By the time we unpacked our shopping  my ice cream tub had already started to soften.;2016-10-23T10:29:59+0000;10155357531214377_10155359022584377;pageowner;0;Sorry about this Sue, did you point this out to any colleagues at the time?

And B, if I witnessed a child fall out of a trolley, I wouldn't just walk away, I would at least ask if they were ok. It's called compassion. Something you and this store worker seem lacking.

I have just had to telephone customer services for the second time in as many weeks because of items I have received going out of date the day after delivery. I have just spoken to a man from your CS who told me that the day after delivery isn t considered a  short shelf life but that seems pretty short to me! This morning I have received two salads  avocados  fish fillets and raspberries all with a use by date of the 24th and a packet of prawns with a use by date of today. There is nothing on the delivery note to let me know the early expiry date of these items so I don t know until the driver has gone and I ve unpacked the shopping. I am pretty sure that a few months ago these items used to appear on the delivery note giving me the option to refuse them.

My colleague has let you know of the correct process, only items that go out of date on the day of delivery are considered short life, so these items wouldn't have been marked on the delivery note. There haven't been any recent changes to this policy. Our pickers choose from the dates available in store so there might not be longer dates available, but you can certainly return anything that doesn't suit to the driver.

I have just had to telephone customer services for the second time in as many weeks because of items I have received going out of date the day after delivery. I have just spoken to a man from your CS who told me that the day after delivery isn t considered a  short shelf life but that seems pretty short to me! This morning I have received two salads  avocados  fish fillets and raspberries all with a use by date of the 24th and a packet of prawns with a use by date of today. There is nothing on the delivery note to let me know the early expiry date of these items so I don t know until the driver has gone and I ve unpacked the shopping.

Surely there should be something on the delivery note to let me know that there are items going out of date the next day? I can't see how anyone would be happy taking delivery of items that they have to eat within one day! The prawns that arrived today and went out of date today (now in the bin) weren't on the delivery note or in a blue bag. Basically you can give all of the stuff going out of date to your online shoppers! I spend ¬£180 per week on shopping with Sainsbury's and that kind of service is terrible. I won't be doing it anymore. Nicola.;2016-10-23T19:13:14+0000;2

Like I'll get 3 packs of chicken breasts, a pack of salmon, and some breaded fish that will all need eating within 2 days, but then I go back and check what the 'typical life' was on the listing and claim a refund for whatever isn't possible to eat within the dates they've given me.

Asda state on most items how many days you're likely to get out of it before its use by date. If you receive something that is out of date before the number of days they state, you apply for a refund for short life... It happens quite a lot, I get a lot of refunds, it's really annoying when you might end up without 2 nights meals, but at least give you an estimate of how long you should get in the first place which a) helps you meal plan and b) encourages the person picking the order to adhere to the advertised number of days of 'typical life'.   Ftr, I prefer Sainsburys food hands down, but things like this are what made me change all my online shopping to Asda;2016-10-23T19:23:18+0000;2

I am pretty sure that a few months ago these items used to appear on the delivery note giving me the option to refuse them. The prawns are now going into the bin and I have two salads that have seen better days so by tomorrow will be pretty inedible. I have just been refunded for the items but that s not what I want I would rather have food that I can use. It seems to be that the people who have their shopping delivered are getting all of the almost out of date items that your in-store shoppers don t want?;2016-10-23T10:07:14+0000;10155357467434377_10155359381804377;8d7eb669cbb419b46b97ec0df83a29591d406606;0;Can you not freeze the prawns and fish?

I have just had to telephone customer services for the second time in as many weeks because of items I have received going out of date the day after delivery. I have just spoken to a man from your CS who told me that the day after delivery isn t considered a  short shelf life but that seems pretty short to me!

Most pickers will make sure you get the product with the longest shelf life on display, but unfortunately we get told to only 'short date' things which goes out of date the same day. I take as much pride in my work as possible, and I try my absolute hardest to give the customer the best products available for me to pick. This includes getting down on my hands and knees to get to the very back of the bottom shelf to get a completely un-dented tin of something, to digging through bags of salad to find the freshest one, to spending far too long finding the best bananas for you. I promise you, we do not pick short dated things on purpose! My aim is to always pick products I would be happy to receive myself. We get measured on pick speed and are expected to work very fast so sometimes the occasional mistake will happen. Like I said, i understand your frustration and I'm sorry you received so many short date products today. :(;2016-10-23T21:30:52+0000;2

We get to the till for them to tell us it s a 20minute wait. Ok fair enough. We ordered an omelette and a breakfast sandwich and went to sit down. Nearly 10 mins later a colleague came over to say they had run out of omelettes. Right ok- bit annoying but I understand it happens in good service sometimes. The woman told me I had to queue up again to change my order. Again  annoying- there were around 15 people in the queue and she genuinely expected me to queue again to sort their issue out? So I went and stood near the entrance of the kitchen to wait for a colleague. The same woman came out again- I asked if she could simply swap it for something like a big breakfast and it would be fine. She said she would get her team leader out to speak to me. So again I waited  and the same woman came out again (not her team leader) and told me for the privilege of solving their stock issue I would have to pay 40p. Not only that  I would have to queue up to pay 40p to get my breakfast. Are you kidding me? I know it s only 40p and it s really not the biggest problem in the world but when a girl is hungry  a girl is hangry! We went to customer services for a refund as we clearly weren t going to get to speak to this mythical team leader she promised me  didn t even get a sorry there  just a confused look and not a clue what she was actually doing. We did get a refund  but she took our receipt from us as apparently to give us our receipt back  we needed to wait for a supervisor. I m sorry for the essay but actually I m pretty annoyed by your poor service this morning.;2016-10-23T09:42:37+0000;10155357375389377_10155358772044377;pageowner;0;Sorry about your poor experience Hannah.

To help prevent fraud you can only redeem your points at your home store, which is set by Nectar based on the store you shop at most often. If there's been a mistake with your home store or you'd like to change it, the colleagues in store can call Nectar for you, but unfortunately they were closed when you were in store. You can get in touch with Nectar here to make sure your home store is right - https://www.nectar.com/contact. Leigh;2016-10-23T15:25:21+0000;0

I thought asking my question on this Sainsburys site would get a quicker result than telling the workers at the store. After all, the packaging of these chickens is not mutilated so it is not the fault of the store. It should be quite easy for you to trace the origin of these chickens and find out why every one has two broken wings (incidentally, two bones are broken in each wing). No other supermarket chickens have this issue - I have sampled chickens from other supermarkets to check and done a survey of my family and friends.

This ring is of huge sentimental value to me and I was devastated when I noticed I had lost it some point between leaving our home in North Somerset and arriving at our holiday cottage in Motherby. One of the few places we had stopped was at your Penrith store to pick up some bits and pieces for our two-week holiday so we decided to pop back to the store the following morning on the off chance I had lost it there. I asked a very helpful lady on customer services if it had been found  to my utter amazement it had and I am so very grateful to the person who handed it in  I hope they might see this and be assured of my grateful appreciation. Thank you so much.;2016-10-22T17:10:09+0000;10155354709549377_10155357953619377;pageowner;0;Amazing Jen!

We don t like to complain but last night  the Bourne store had a number of issues with products not available  especially within fresh food. Other items were pushed to the back of shelves  making it difficult to reach them. Apparently this is to help with stocktaking that is taking place this weekend.

It sounds like you've spoken to a duty manager or one of our customer service team as you've been made aware of an upcoming stocktake. Did they not assist you with finding those items?

We don t like to complain but last night  the Bourne store had a number of issues with products not available  especially within fresh food. Other items were pushed to the back of shelves  making it difficult to reach them. Apparently this is to help with stocktaking that is taking place this weekend.

We are the UK‚Äôs leading retailer for sustainable fish, and we‚Äôre proud that Greenpeace has given us recognition over the years for the sustainable sourcing of all of our own brand canned tuna. 100% of our By Sainsbury's, Taste the Difference and Basics canned tuna is caught using pole and line. We have made great progress to extend this further to products such as sandwiches, sushi and ready meals. We expect every one of our suppliers to take a responsible approach to sourcing. John West is working in partnership with WWF and has set out a number of goals to drive up its sustainability status by the end of 2018. We are monitoring its progress very closely, we continue to maintain an ongoing dialogue with them on this important issue and will act accordingly if this is not fulfilled.

The pricing of items in caf√© is different to the rest of the store because of the service and space element. It is common practice that cafe and restaurant prices are greater than the price of buying in a supermarket aisle to eat at home.

The till person then called over a supervisor  who just agreed with the cashier and I was forced to purchase only one of each. Not only is this refusal wrong  and the information provided by your staff incorrect  I normally have absolutely no issue purchasing this quantity anywhere - including this same store which I use regularly at weekends.  Either you re normally wrong to sell me this or you were wrong this morning  which is it?  My suggestion would be that the staff in stores be made aware of the actual legislation limits when attempting to communicate a refusal of sale to a customer  and also to treat said customer with manners and respect  as opposed to how I was spoken to this morning.;2016-10-22T10:20:29+0000;10155353674354377_10155357197759377;1995f82164a0a873a790b64c071de44c5f870de2;1;I don't recall seeing it no - I may have missed it.

Our policy states that sales are restricted to a maximum of 2 packets of a combination of any paracetamol, aspirin or ibuprofen based products in a single transaction. Sales are also restricted to customers aged 16 and over. We have taken this decision as a responsible retailer and in line with the advised guidance from the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). This policy balances the needs of our customers for immediate pain relief and prevents stockpiling of medicines which may lead to accidental or impulsive overdose. Further medication above 2 packs has to sold under the supervision of a pharmacist and customers can visit Lloyds Pharmacy in Sainsbury‚Äôs store. Thanks for getting in touch, Steve.;2016-10-22T11:57:56+0000;1

As a responsible retailer we adhere to the government legislation that surrounds the promotion of baby formula over breastfeeding. As part of this we are not allowed to accept money off coupons, discount vouchers or Nectar points as payment for any transactions which contain baby formula. Unfortunately this also applies to any promotions in-store as we are not allowed to promote these products over breastfeeding.  You can view information on why this is excluded from any promotions on our Help Centre including a link to the legislation here: http://bit.ly/1AHiV4f  I can understand how this comment may have made you feel, and I'd like to make sure this is fed back to the store manager so that some additional training can be provided for our colleague to ensure that they are informing our customers about this legislation correctly. Can you give me a description, or the colleague name if you were able to get it? Many thanks, Ryan.;2016-10-21T20:47:22+0000;2

I grew up into an intelligent, healthy and energetic child. Everyone does parenting differently and while I don't agree that formula is necessarily better than, or even as good as breastfeeding, I certainly don't think it should be painted in such a negative picture. Kale is better for kids than chicken nuggets but you still see people in McDonalds! As long as babies are fed and loved I see no harm - particularly if a mother is physically unable to breastfeed.;2016-10-22T12:27:06+0000;2

After speaking with Ryan Pierce in customer service I realised that I had a very empathetic and considerate guy at the other end of the line. I told him that I was in Cork  Ireland  and that my father-in-law was in Arrowe Park hospital with no ability to get items that he needed. His wife too was very unwell and they both have no other family in the area. I was informed that this isn t a service that Sainsbury s provides but having heard our predicament Ryan said he d see what he could do! Ryan called back a little while later to say that he had spoke to his manager  Mike Patterson  and both agreed that it was something they wanted to help with. I was so grateful and I went on to list out the items he needed. I started giving Ryan my Visa number and he stopped me to say that they wanted to do this as a good will gesture and asked if I thought that he d like a cake with that? I was totally taken aback by this generosity and have vowed to pass on the act of kindness. Well done Ryan and Mike  you have reinforced my belief that there are amazing people in this world!

His wife too was very unwell and they both have no other family in the area. I was informed that this isn t a service that Sainsbury s provides but having heard our predicament Ryan said he d see what he could do! Ryan called back a little while later to say that he had spoke to his manager  Mike Patterson  and both agreed that it was something they wanted to help with. I was so grateful and I went on to list out the items he needed. I started giving Ryan my Visa number and he stopped me to say that they wanted to do this as a good will gesture and asked if I thought that he d like a cake with that? I was totally taken aback by this generosity and have vowed to pass on the act of kindness. Well done Ryan and Mike  you have reinforced my belief that there are amazing people in this world!

After speaking with Ryan Pierce in customer service I realised that I had a very empathetic and considerate guy at the other end of the line. I told him that I was in Cork  Ireland  and that my father-in-law was in Arrowe Park hospital with no ability to get items that he needed. His wife too was very unwell and they both have no other family in the area. I was informed that this isn t a service that Sainsbury s provides but having heard our predicament Ryan said he d see what he could do! Ryan called back a little while later to say that he had spoke to his manager  Mike Patterson  and both agreed that it was something they wanted to help with. I was so grateful and I went on to list out the items he needed. I started giving Ryan my Visa number and he stopped me to say that they wanted to do this as a good will gesture and asked if I thought that he d like a cake with that? I was totally taken aback by this generosity and have vowed to pass on the act of kindness. Well done Ryan and Mike  you have reinforced my belief that there are amazing people in this world!

After speaking with Ryan Pierce in customer service I realised that I had a very empathetic and considerate guy at the other end of the line. I told him that I was in Cork  Ireland  and that my father-in-law was in Arrowe Park hospital with no ability to get items that he needed. His wife too was very unwell and they both have no other family in the area. I was informed that this isn t a service that Sainsbury s provides but having heard our predicament Ryan said he d see what he could do! Ryan called back a little while later to say that he had spoke to his manager  Mike Patterson  and both agreed that it was something they wanted to help with. I was so grateful and I went on to list out the items he needed. I started giving Ryan my Visa number and he stopped me to say that they wanted to do this as a good will gesture and asked if I thought that he d like a cake with that? I was totally taken aback by this generosity and have vowed to pass on the act of kindness. Well done Ryan and Mike  you have reinforced my belief that there are amazing people in this world!

After speaking with Ryan Pierce in customer service I realised that I had a very empathetic and considerate guy at the other end of the line. I told him that I was in Cork  Ireland  and that my father-in-law was in Arrowe Park hospital with no ability to get items that he needed. His wife too was very unwell and they both have no other family in the area. I was informed that this isn t a service that Sainsbury s provides but having heard our predicament Ryan said he d see what he could do! Ryan called back a little while later to say that he had spoke to his manager  Mike Patterson  and both agreed that it was something they wanted to help with. I was so grateful and I went on to list out the items he needed. I started giving Ryan my Visa number and he stopped me to say that they wanted to do this as a good will gesture and asked if I thought that he d like a cake with that? I was totally taken aback by this generosity and have vowed to pass on the act of kindness. Well done Ryan and Mike  you have reinforced my belief that there are amazing people in this world!

Yesterday my 2 year old daughter ate the gel from the inside of one of your nappies  she wasn t in any distress so I called customer services to check if the nappy contained any toxins than I should worry about. The gentleman I spoke to said he needed to pass the details on to the communication department which usually get back within 5 days?!!! He assured me that because of the nature of the situation they would call back within 2 hours....27 hours later and I have still had no call back. I did find out from her Dr that there was nothing to worry about as the gel was wet when she ate it so it wouldn t swell inside her and it wasn t toxic but I think the lack of communication from Sainsburys on this matter is very disappointing.;2016-10-20T17:20:50+0000;10155347147359377_10155347581954377;pageowner;0;Hey Kirsty!

Apologies about the experience you had. What you've described is a Nectar procedure designed to protect your points so that no one else will use them. If, for example, your bank saw strange transactions on your account outwith the trend of what you normally buy, they would contact you to ask for confirmation; with Nectar it's a similar process. It's just a security measure. As the colleagues made you aware, there is way around it, which is to call Nectar and they will happily put the transaction through for you. I hope this clears the matter up for you. Have a nice day! Daryl.";2016-10-20T14:26:15+0000;1

Unfortunately I didn t catch the driver s name but I was impressed at his level of customer service and at the fact that he arrived in good time (7:45pm in a 7:30pm to 8:30pm slot).  The road I live on is unfortunately extremely narrow and delivery drivers tend to just block up the road (infuriating my neighbours in the process üôÑ) but the driver tonight parked down the road and with consideration.  He took the time to explain the substitution process and also explained how I could hand back any substitutions to him. He also explained and handed me some other offers that would be available after my delivery today and even took the time to help check my delivery was ok and encouraged me to do the same.  It d be great if these comments could be passed on.   I won t hesitate to recommend you and will definitely be back online again very soon üòÉ;2016-10-18T19:04:57+0000;10155339396099377_10155341484974377;pageowner;0;Amazing, thank you very much for your feedback Ro.

Every so often it disappears  and after a protest rom customers and much confusion as to who has made this decision  it appears again. It is now no longer available. I asked at the bakery why. I gathered from the response that they are asked this many times. The answer was that they are no longer allowed to make it. Same response at customer services. This is the biggest complaint in my local store.  I would suggest for every customer who does ask  many more just accept it.  What exactly is the problem? Are you making too much profit? Is somebody employed just to upset customers? It just beggars belief that one product that is so popular is withdrawn. I have been told that this is now the final time. Sadly then  this will be the final time I shop at Sainsburys. Yes  it is available in the other shape  but I don t want that. For me it is the only item that makes Sainsburys different to all the other supermarkets and the reason why I went there despite having a Tesco and Lidl nearer. If you are refusing to sell it  then there is no point in trekking across town. I suspect you have lost other customers who also feel the same way. What a way to run a business!;2016-10-18T16:42:11+0000;10155338848984377_10155341379504377;pageowner;0;Sorry you're unhappy Shirley, what store did you visit?

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.  He offered again and I said yes  and Kieran said thank you took my hand and walked out of the shop.  I am so grateful for your staffs patience  care and compassion for my son in what is a really distressful time for us both.  I will not forget this.

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.  He offered again and I said yes  and Kieran said thank you took my hand and walked out of the shop.  I am so grateful for your staffs patience  care and compassion for my son in what is a really distressful time for us both.  I will not forget this.

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.  He offered again and I said yes  and Kieran said thank you took my hand and walked out of the shop.  I am so grateful for your staffs patience  care and compassion for my son in what is a really distressful time for us both.  I will not forget this.

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.  He offered again and I said yes  and Kieran said thank you took my hand and walked out of the shop.

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.  He offered again and I said yes  and Kieran said thank you took my hand and walked out of the shop.

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.  He offered again and I said yes  and Kieran said thank you took my hand and walked out of the shop.

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.  He offered again and I said yes  and Kieran said thank you took my hand and walked out of the shop.

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.  He offered again and I said yes  and Kieran said thank you took my hand and walked out of the shop.

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.  He offered again and I said yes  and Kieran said thank you took my hand and walked out of the shop.

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.

I was trying to use the self service till but I've got a shoulder problem and can only use one arm properly at the moment, however one of the workers, a lady, came over and helped me to pack and input info on the till.  I was all flustered but she didn't make me feel line the numpty I was!  I Tweeted Sainsbury's and they asked for a description of the lady and they would feed it back to the manager, which I hope they've done. She was fab. .;2016-10-19T20:16:02+0000;6

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.

I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.  He offered again and I said yes  and Kieran said thank you took my hand and walked out of the shop.  I am so grateful for your staffs patience  care and compassion for my son in what is a really distressful time for us both.  I will not forget this.  Unfortunately in all of the stress I didnt get the manager or his colleagues name  but they deserve recognition for what they did for a wee scared boy.

I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.  He offered again and I said yes  and Kieran said thank you took my hand and walked out of the shop.  I am so grateful for your staffs patience  care and compassion for my son in what is a really distressful time for us both.  I will not forget this.  Unfortunately in all of the stress I didnt get the manager or his colleagues name  but they deserve recognition for what they did for a wee scared boy.  Thank you.;2016-10-17T19:07:14+0000;10155335372479377_10155346181404377;198eef0192ebdec6f7d60d3366f6cd58c8f90c24;0;This article has me in tears.

The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.

I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.

I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.  He offered again and I said yes  and Kieran said thank you took my hand and walked out of the shop.  I am so grateful for your staffs patience  care and compassion for my son in what is a really distressful time for us both.  I will not forget this.  Unfortunately in all of the stress I didnt get the manager or his colleagues name  but they deserve recognition for what they did for a wee scared boy.

Thank you for looking. There seems to be so much for boys but very little like this for baby girls, i know there will be at Christmas but i need a superhero outfit and the pink would have looked so cute. I did pick up the blue one for her though, it was just on the off chance another store had a pink one left. Thank you for your help, much appreciated.;2016-10-18T09:53:15+0000;0

It seems odd, to us - your competitors have no such price hike; the butter is English so it's nothing to do with the value of the pound against foreign currencies for import purposes; butter is typically a fairly stable price, and this has been stable for many many months and then suddenly - BAM, up by nearly a third.

With the well-filled sandwiches and wide selection to cater to all?  Now it s some new supplier  with a piss poor selection of sandwiches now available in the meal deal.  Despite being the same price  quality has taken a nose dive.  What used to be in the meal deal  has been taken out  with nothing to replace it.  I now go to Boots  who ve used the same supplier for decades - as Sainsbury did  but Sainsbury don t like that local British business.  Oh well  we know now that to sainsbury  profit for the shareholders are more important than savings to the consumer  because as I m sure we all agree... the new sandwich range is overpriced  underfilled and all round poor.

So no longer when I visit will I get to eat unsalted anchor spreadable butter on my taste the difference crumpets. It saddens me that this terrible state of affairs happened over the simplest of errors. On one of my mother s many weekly deliveries - the delivery driver broke the wine THE WINE!! I mean that in itself is the most unreasonable of acts. What ensued was beyond nonsensical. A back and forth conversation which exceeded all realms of reason.

I ordered my shopping on Thursday to be delivered on Friday 14th in the evening  I received a pho all Friday morning to say that you had a driver phone in sick and you would not be able to get my shopping to me  I was a bit annoyed but knew it couldn t be helped. I was told that my shopping would be with me the next morning  my shopping was delivered but a crate was missing ! A bit fed up but the delivery driver called the store on my doorstep and explained to them some of my shopping was missing. The sore told him that they would get my shopping out to me by 6pm that evening..... 6.30pm came and no shopping !! So I called the contact centre and got through to somebody who clearly didn t want to be at work  wasn t helpful and I was kept on hold for 20 minutes and then had to repeat everything I said to him the first time  he said he was speaking to the store  he told me there was no record of my missing shopping and I had to re-order the missing items one by one on the phone with him  I was on the phone for over 40 minutes. He then said my items would be out to me this morning first thing but he couldn t give me a time. So once again I wait in for my shopping  thinking I ll just get a refund and go get the bits myself  by 1pm today still no shopping !! I AGAIN call the contact centre  go through all of the story again  get put on hold again  to be told ....... Guess what no record of my shopping coming out to me !!!  This person was slightly more helpful and gave me a name of the store manager and a phone number and said if I m not called back within the hour to call the store manager. Yes I had to call myself as no one called me  the store manager was very helpful and kept me on the line while he went into what I could hear was the delivery department as he spoke to someone who said that yes they had my shopping  yes it was going onto one of the vans and yes I would get my shopping today.

On no occasion would I be stopping any attending of an emergency or similar and it is wrong to suggest so, the only ones I intended to inconvenience were to misusers. As Tesco are doing something about it proactively, then we may have to rethink our shopping habits.

There is always always items missing and then last minute trip the shops to get items needed for a recipe. Training urgently needed for packers and random replacements. Today rather than grated light cheese - I got full fat block cheese and to add insult to injury you charged me 19 packs. Yes 19.  Surely the options of other lighter cheese would be more sense. Rather than black dye - replaced with colour catcher. That s a joke.  Plus list of other replacements.  Fruits are often already ripe or going off. Actually had a packet of biscuits that are out of date once. Biscuits...how old must they have been. Never never have this problem with Ocado. I only use Sainsbury s now when Ocado is booked up.

When I went to the customer service desk to add the points to my card I was told that as I had thousands in points that it couldn t possibly be right and that the lady behind the desk had to enquire as to whether she could add the points to my card. She was told that this was the case but as she started to add my points  with no hint of customer service whatsoever I might add  she kept on telling me that this wasn t right and it shouldn t be allowed. When I stated that I had correctly paid for shopping worth ¬£10 or more to receive each voucher I was still met with a tirade of  well it s not right  shouldn t be allowed  I asked her what the issue was as it wasn t her money I was taking and she said  yes it s my wages !

You say the promotion was incorrect, however the email from you guys states that 'the promotion has proved very popular and sold out' How did sainsburys decide to honour their promotion mistake to enough people for it to 'sell out' to some people but cancel my order? If you check my nectar card you'll see I'm a regular sainsburys customer so presumably loyalty wasn't the deciding factor?

This year has been awful with shopping lines that we have always bought suddenly varnishping from the shelf never to be seen again! In my store  I ve lost my coffee  washing powder  bin bags  ribs  herbs and plenty of other things in this year alone  not to mention those last year.  Due to this  I m now having to drive 20 miles each way just to go to Waitrose to get those missing lines! Well  if I have to go out of my way I just as well do the whole shop there instead! I shopped at Sainsburys with my parents as a little girl  so it s been my main supermarket for over 40 years. I m very disappointed with Sainsburys Chaddensden in regards to choice of stock  attitude of one or two members of staff (Adam on pre packed meats) and when a customer does make a query  generally lied to. Very disappointed! I hope the possibility that Waitrose is coming to Derby.

Made purchase received confirmation email for price of ¬£263.99 now at 8.45pm the day before my delivery is due I was called to tell me they are cancelling the order because of high demand. I will not accept this as a valid reason if that was the case they shouldnt have offered and accepted my payment. Then I called them to which they offered little understanding saying its a stock issue these items are in constant circulation and are restocked constantly they didn t even offer me an alternative delivery date. I feel totally mislead and then lied to over the phone. I would have never entered my personal details into this website if it wasnt for the for said deal again I feel tricked into giving away my details something I don t take lightly. I sat on hold for 15 mins then kept repeatedly being put on hold. If this companies software/website is misleading people to the point where they are having to deal with high cancellations because they cant honor what they confirm then it should not be running. Although staff were polite I would have expected them to have honored the deal whilst i made my complaint  totally ridiculous to leave your staff in such a vulnerable position having to deal with totally unreasonable situations as a customer it was distressing and i can imagine to any reasonable thinking member of staff the situation would have been equally distressing.

It is due to the warm September that we've had here in the UK bringing the season forward on soft fruit. Unfortunately it is now coming to a very quick end which pushes prices up and availability down. At this time of year we also have to source our fruit from glass house growers where prices are much higher due to production factors (such as heating). We try our best to maintain the same price point, but in some circumstances we will move the pack size down rather than increasing the cost per item. I hope this clears things up for you.

From your account I can see you had accepted evouchers for most of your complaints. The Social Media Team have passed your details to the store where your deliveries come from. If you would like, I can arrange for them to call you if there is anything you are still unhappy with. I'd be happy to pass on any feedback of how you would like this resolved or what your expectations are. I can see you have a delivery booked for today, I hope you find it satisfactory.

I have received a suitable apology for a driver turning up earlier with out calling by first, I have not received an apology for him trying to get passed my poorly mother who wasn't sure what was happening and no I have received an apology for the several items that have been returned back to the store as the use by/best before date was the same as the delivery date. All of this has happened since being in touch with the care team. My expectation is for you to take the problem and try to resolve it and not tell me it not you issue I need to call the store, my expectation is for the picker's to for the process's set down by the company and my expectation is when promises are made there are kept or which the store hasn't again. I use you as morrisons don't offer this service in my area at the moment I use you as all but one off the drivers have been brilliant I need shopping delivered I can trust as I have mobility issues myself.

You say you help to resolve complaints but for over 4 weeks all the careline team did was ignore me, not understand/clarify the problem and fob me of, it's taken the careline team almost 3 days to answer what you do, one reply was what do you mean. Do you normally take a month to pass the complaints to the right departments with all the right information, I hoped you would have made this easier unfortunately you've added stress to the situation. I want to move forward with sainsburys but for some reason you don't want to help/resolve the problems,  please look at the history and tell me how we can move forward?;2016-10-13T08:37:48+0000;0

I'll ensure your comments are fed back to the store's management regarding this. I'll also mention the mixing of vegan/vegetarian in with the other products as well. In regards to your comment about the escallops, are these the ones you're referring to here: http://bit.ly/2dMFm3R? I'll look and see when we are next expecting them in. What type of vegan ice cream are you looking for? I can also log a product request for you. Amanda.;2016-10-13T09:51:09+0000;0

Tastier and cheaper.  All that was there in your own brand were the cauliflower cheese ones, not the meat substitute ones - unless they'd been 'hidden' away from the main section.  Ice cream - When I was talking to a manager on the 'phone (can't remember name), I'd mentioned the scrumptious vegan ice creams that both Morrisons and Tesco do (they look and taste like Strawberry Cornettos).  the manager said that they would be getting in vegan ice cream once the new freezers were in.  he didn't specify exactly what brand, or what form.   Layout - I realised what's annoyed me so much after I'd turned the computer off last night - in the pre-refit layout, all the 'human food' (excepting the complete baby section) was together and flowed from item to item.  The freezers have now been moved half a store away and are completely disconnected from the rest of the food.  If the alcohol remains where it is, with the bakery going to where the freezers used to be, that's going to put the most direct route from bakery to freezers through the alcohol - not good at all, for anybody as it will tempt people to buy when alcohol does so much harm, except perhaps Sainsbury's profits.;2016-10-13T17:50:30+0000;0

The freezers have now been moved half a store away and are completely disconnected from the rest of the food. If the alcohol remains where it is, with the bakery going to where the freezers used to be, that's going to put the most direct route from bakery to freezers through the alcohol - not good at all, for anybody as it will tempt people to buy when alcohol does so much harm, except perhaps Sainsbury's profits.;2016-10-13T17:52:34+0000;0

Sainsbury's have been down graded from a supermarket to a convenience store. No less than 1 Day has past since the ""bundle deal"" of a PS4 with Fifa17 for ¬£239 has come to an end, which Sainsbury's were unable to honour due to lack of availability of Fifa17 may I add, that the shelves in my nearest Sainsbury's were full with this game. Very convenient indeed Sainsbury's!!! It was pleasing to see that your staff in the store when I returned the PS4 believe in ethics and could not believe you would not honour the deal I bought in good faith as they had this game in abundance AND they were still advertising the very same offer. What irritates me the most is nobody we have dealt with prior to this sees anything wrong with the fact you found it acceptable to have the sheer cheek to try charge me ¬£259 for the PS4 on its own rather than the ¬£239 we had signed up to pay which included Fifa17. #PAYMOREFORLESS;2016-10-13T16:12:36+0000;1

JOKE. 20 mins on the phone today to be told that you couldn t keep up with the demand  that the delivering store sold out of Fifa17 over a week ago which was prior to when I even placed the order so this was never going to be honoured let s be honest  that the deal has now finished so I will not be getting sent Fifa17 when it comes back into stock and that I have 2 Options. Option 1 ....... I can keep the goods I have been delivered and pay THE INFLATED PRICE hahahahaha I am still laughing that this was a serious suggestion or option 2 I can return the goods for a refund. No surprises on what is coming back your way tomorrow then! What a great example of sticking 2 fingers up to your customers so congratulations. #PAYMOREFORLESS;2016-10-12T20:55:50+0000;10155314862834377_10155317810479377;6bd5fb8a837b9104df99b7620edfa57e9e15c53c;0;What a joke, hope you get it sorted Hun üòò xx;2016-10-13T16:16:39+0000;1

Being 32 weeks pregnant I have the appetite of a large pig. But this is where the problem starts.   So I m sat on the sofa  relishing in the sight of my 10 month old sleeping peacefully on my lap when my partner shouts from the kitchen  there s only 16 chicken nuggets . As this is not an immediate cause of concern for me I reply  yeah...and?    There s supposed to be 20. Sainsbury s have ripped us off!   Well  as you can imagine I m pretty gutted and upset. My hormones are all over the place as it is and for something like this to happen  well it damn near tips me over the edge.  Also as a result of this my family has significantly less food to eat at lunch and will probably have to have something more. Which then will result in another trip to Sainsbury s even sooner than thought. So as well as ripping us off by 4 chicken nuggets you are also going to be making more money out of us.  I really hope this doesn t happen again as we may be forced into using a more reputable source if chicken nuggets in future.

Great I thought ! I will certainly be buying these!  Until tonight! Tonight I have a poorly baby! He s rocking a temperature over 39 degrees  it s 10pm and he s awake crying again for the third time in three hours  I notice his nappy is ridiculously full so I decide to change it  I grab the pack of little ones I used last night and there is two left in the pack. Great I think! I strip his wet nappy off him ( now I don t know if the designers of nappies have ever wrestled an alligator but I m sure that s pretty much compared to trying to get a hysterical baby through a nappy change)   I get the new nappy and a minute later we re almost successful but on the final sticky tab we fall at the last hurdle. It rips clean off - it s like it s just been stuck on the nappy gahhh frustration i grab the second and final nappy in the pack - still putting my faith in these nappies  meanwhilst the twisting screaming hysterical one has rolled away to the other side of the bed! Grrr more frustration  right grab the baby  grab the nappy #round2 ha ha I think clever me keeping three nappies upstairs ( yesterday s and today s) and low and behold at the final hurdle against snaps clean off - straight lines no tears just like it pulled straight off! Rargh! Frustration !!! I know have a screaming poorly twisty baby naked on the bed and no nappies to put on him! The rest are downstairs !! So making sure he s secure I run as fast as I can down the stairs grab the nappy and like an Olympian I m running back up the stairs and through the safety gate in seconds.  Seconds it took me. Almost as many seconds as it took him to wee all over my bed!  So thank you Sainsbury s your nappies are super absorbent ( much like my bed) but I will not be recommending or using them if 2 out 3 snap the sticky fasteners off.  Maybe it s worth mentioning to the nappy designers that not all babies lay still whilst you change nappies and strong sticky sides may be needed if in doubt try and wrestle an angry baby into a nappy   Love from one stressed out mummy.;2016-10-11T21:16:41+0000;10155311474084377_10155313002814377;pageowner;0;Hello, Tallulah.

Turns out that there wasn t any in stock and that it was never going to be delivered.  So while I was on the way home from work today my son took a phone call from someone at Sainsburys who left a message my son about delivery of an xbox. So the surprise that was supposed to be for his birthday (something I told to the person I spoke to last night) is now no longer a surprise.  So now not only do I not have an xbox I also now have a son who knows what he s having for his birthday! May I suggest in future that people only give out product information when they know who they are dealing with.;2016-10-11T16:02:15+0000;10155310450544377_10155310748239377;48088c2b8f5faf4c6ce96e6299b4a19ecce3bcd0;1;Have messaged you.;2016-10-11T17:39:00+0000;0

By half past ten my delivery still hasn t arrived. I have just phoned your customer service team. The explanation I received was that the delivery address was missing the first line ( hard to believe when I entered this address manually twice online. My billing address was received correctly though? I left a contact number at the time of booking the delivery however your delivery driver decided to not bother to use it. 10:35 I have no shopping  an empty fridge  a hungry husband and I now have to wait until 3pm tomorrow to receive my order. My daughter now has no packed lunch for tomorrow. I am disgusted with the service I have received tonight. One phone call to me could have easily resolved this... I guess the delivery driver was tired and wanted to go home?

You had the most tasty and best value range of meal deals in any supermarket I thought. Now the choice is not as good and less tasty. Some of my friends are also up in arms about it. It's not life or death or anything :-).... but we now feel we are getting less for the same price. Just bog standard sandwiches. It wasn't broken in the first place, so please don't try and fix it. You will lose custom over it. I and a few people I know will not be having lunch/tea there anymore. It's now 1.50/2 pounds extra per visit, just to get what you had before ie. anything really tasty... and It all adds up over the week. Please change it back to the old format and maybe just add a few new things every now and again... but don't change the quality/value... people will/are noticing. Thanks for replying Hayley.

Witnessed a visibly and extremely intoxicated man hurling verbal abuse at shoppers of other ethnicities and behaving in a threatening manner towards shoppers while staff just laughed about it and actually seemed to enjoy this behaviour. They were engaging in conversation with him which leads me to believe he is a former employee or a current employee off duty. This is abhorrent and shocking! No manager on site to control this and no security to escort the man out. At one point he sidekicked a member of staff (although not violently) and staff were unfazed not only by how inappropriate this was but also completely oblivious to shoppers staring at their blatant unprofessionalism. Staff need SERIOUS training and major investment needed in management and security. Most definitely will think twice before going to a Sainsbury s shop again.;2016-10-10T11:13:00+0000;10155306443664377_10155306688054377;pageowner;0;Hi Aldo, I'm so sorry you had to witness this.

Yesterday I walked into my local store and they had new big signs at the end of the aisle saying that they were now half price. I looked everywhere but I couldn t see any so I asked the staff about them. No one seemed to know what they were and suggested that they didn t stock them. When i pointed them out on the sign they confirmed they hadn t had any but said the sign was there to advertise and it did say while stocks last. I understand this so I asked since the sign had gone up had they had any stock to which they replied they hadn t. So my question to you sainsburys is why would you put large end of the aisle posters up advertising fisher price beat bos at half Price in store s that had never received any stock since they went up?

I've seen grown women in Tesco pushing and shoving to get full cases of shopkins despite kids trying to reach them and just seems really greedy they are allowed to buya full unopened case. I wouldn't pay ebay prices or import prices from the US (everyone going crazy for halloween shopkins cause they are supposed up be US only release not UK too) personally I think they are over priced for what they are (not sainsburys pricing it's a fixed UK price);2016-10-10T09:05:57+0000;0

This morning Iain and I witnessed a severely disabled man being refused entry to the store in Portswood  because despite the shutters and doors being opened (and left wide open) it was only 10:21 and the store  didn t open until 10:30 . This man clearly had a severe spinal disability- but rather than offering him a seat he was left to stand and wait for a further 7minutes before himself  and the others waiting were let in  at 10:28! Not even 10:30! They didn t even follow the  10:30  rule through. Why couldn t the store make an exception and let this man  for whom standing and walking was clearly a strain  sit and wait inside? Why didn t an employee point out a place for him to sit and wait? Isn t it obvious that waiting like that is a lot more taxing on the physically disabled. When I complained to the store manager I was expecting a response along the lines of  that s terrible  I m sorry to have let a customer down like that  we will see what we can do to stop anything similar happening again ... Instead I was horrified by his lack of empathy and general indifference.  Well what do you want me to do?  Was the response. I want you to apologise!

Was he complaining? Was he physically showing signs of not being able to stand any longer? It would be awful of Sainsburys to assume someone needs help completley based on appearance. Would you go up to a person in a wheelchair and assume they cant do things themselves, trying to  reach everything for them? Am sure if that man in question asked for a chair,sainsburys would have been more than happy to provide it for him.  What if that man seen this post? Am sure he would be hurt and offended that you assumed he wasn't able to stand in a queue like everyone else because you claim he has a spinal disability. when did it even become acceptable for people to become offended by stuff that has nothing to do with them??;2016-10-09T12:00:28+0000;12

This morning Iain and I witnessed a severely disabled man being refused entry to the store in Portswood  because despite the shutters and doors being opened (and left wide open) it was only 10:21 and the store  didn t open until 10:30 . This man clearly had a severe spinal disability- but rather than offering him a seat he was left to stand and wait for a further 7minutes before himself  and the others waiting were let in  at 10:28! Not even 10:30! They didn t even follow the  10:30  rule through. Why couldn t the store make an exception and let this man  for whom standing and walking was clearly a strain  sit and wait inside? Why didn t an employee point out a place for him to sit and wait? Isn t it obvious that waiting like that is a lot more taxing on the physically disabled. When I complained to the store manager I was expecting a response along the lines of  that s terrible  I m sorry to have let a customer down like that  we will see what we can do to stop anything similar happening again ... Instead I was horrified by his lack of empathy and general indifference.  Well what do you want me to do?  Was the response. I want you to apologise! I want you to re-asses the system you have in place and maybe train staff to recognise that some people might need a little extra help. I asked how he would feel if that was him- or his dad- or his grandpa- left to struggle and wait like that? He replied  equality means treating everyone the same  and  the disabled man made a choice  and  he can t control all his customers ...

I spoke to the store manager 'Matt' who said pursuing my complaint further would be redundant as he was the highest level of authority and all he could do was 'check the cctv' and possibly retrain the member of staff who opened the doors in the first place. As somebody with a much loved family member who suffers from a similar disability what I think is most needed is a change in attitude; a touch of courtesy, kindness and consideration can go a long way. Shopping is a way of maintaining independence but I can tell you from personal experience, it can be tough when you have, or are with somebody who struggles so acutely with mobility. A little support from stores can make the world of difference.";2016-10-09T13:49:46+0000;3

Unfortunately ordering online isn't a guarantee that you will receive the product as all orders are subject to stock availability on the day. Not to worry though, I've gone ahead and searched a 50 mile radius of Castlepoint to find any stores nearby that has these for you! I can confirm that our Talbot Heath, Ferndown, Christchurch and Wareham stores all have stock available at the moment! Ryan.;2016-10-10T10:04:04+0000;0

Unfortunately we can't see live stock information, so it could mean that since the store has opened today they've sold out. On the stock system Christchurch is only showing that they had 1 case of stock available today, which is relatively low in comparison to Talbot Heath which had 6 cases of stock available when they opened. I'd recommend giving a call in advance as the customer service team will be more than happy to set as many aside as you'd like, that way you won't have to worry about them selling out before you reach the store.

If you decide not to use them then that's your choice, not Sainsburys. Self scans save them employing 6 people to be sat around listening to you and instead allow it to be supervised by one with the option of a manned checkout.

When I got home and opened them they were frozen. I called the store in tower bridge road and spoke to the manager he said he would be happy to refund  them.  My question why was fresh meat frozen in a chiller cabinet.  He said the fridge was too cold and a customer had already complained about it this week. He also said it happens to their salad.  I asked why don t you adjust the fridge he said it was done centrally .  What I fail to understand is a) why hasn t the temp been changed if you already know abou it? B).

I think I can help. The decongestion capsules used to contain paracetamols many moons ago. The checkout systems seem as though they've not been updates, but probably wouldn't be just because of an ingredient change. So the till probably still thinks you were trying to buy two lots of drugs containing paracetamol. Does this make sense? Unfortunately this stupid information has stuck with me.

Thats why I only wanted two packets. It seems I can only buy two packets of any medication. It would be really useful if you tell you staff what your policy is and perhaps put up a sign by the medicines.

You are ""confident our Careline will always attempt to resolve any complaint professionally and courteously.""  Well you're way off base there as there is a man on there who is not in any way professional or courteous.  Also the fact your grocery customer services can only issue vouchers not refunds is ridiculous.  I am having no more to do with you as I do not agree that I should have to complain to the person I am complaining about. Don't bother replying to this as I am not planning on wasting any more of my time in dealing with you.  The lady at our local store who is in charge of online groceries there is sorting out my refund.  I complained to her before about the customer services and as they are seperate (presumeably in the same way that the ""refunds department"" are seperate to the ""customer services"" and therefore I was unable to recieve a refund this morning (as is my right in law) ) she has no power to do anything about it.  Her name is Daisy and she is the definition of courteous and professional.  As are all the ladies I have spoken to over the years on the customer services line.  You have recordings you obviously feel your customer service line is beyond reproach.   Good for you.  I've got bigger fish to fry as my kid is very poorly (incidentally why I booked the online delivery in the first place).;2016-10-08T14:29:38+0000;0

If you ask any of the staff they are lovely, but upset because they are in the front line of customer dissatisfaction. Tonight I was in there about 16:30, but that really isn't relevant, What is relevant is the lack of staple goods in favour of multiple versions of things that do not appear popular. For example, if you want fresh pasta you have a choice of tagliatelle or  tagliatelle , No spaghetti. I know you have on-line systems, which should be monitoring what sells in each store, but the system appears to be failing. I can understand trying new lines to see if they sell, but taking away commonly used items is stupid. If it doesn't change I will be taking my custom elsewhere, and NOT to a bigger branch of Sainsbury's.;2016-10-07T19:06:58+0000;0

I've been advised that we've been working with the same group of dairy farmers since 2007 who produce the majority of our own label milk and collectively we refer to these farms as the ""Sainsbury‚Äôs Dairy Development Group"" (SDDG).   Due to farms operating a variety of milk production systems the months of the year which cattle are turned out to graze varies. Grazing periods vary due to weather, land type and land availability but the majority of our cows do go out to graze when the weather permits. We do have a small percentage of farms who house their cows all year round. Over the last nine years we have been collecting data to assess the welfare of the cows and this demonstrates that a cows welfare is determined by the farmer managing the farm rather than the production system itself.   Dairy farming is an incredibly complex and sophisticated subject, but we are confident and have the data to prove that the cows on all these farms are well cared for.  The farmer has also advised us that the cows will not be housed inside 24 hours per day and they will be free to graze outside during the dry cow period (the months that the cows aren't milking) if ground conditions allow and also during late lactation period. Unfortunately the soil type at Crouchland is solid weald clay which means it is rock hard in the summer and very muddy in the winter making a full grazed system challenging. I hope this clears things up. Ryan.;2016-10-11T10:54:23+0000;0

It sounds like this isn‚Äôt the only Sainsburys farm that  will keep its herd housed all year round and it feels like it is more an argument for efficiency for the farmer than for the cows welfare . I found  a charity close to where I live and they‚Äôve told me categorically that keeping cows housed all year is not natural nor good for their welfare and that they‚Äôve started a campaign called cows belong in fields . I know there‚Äôs always two sides to an argument but I find it hard to believe that both you and the charity can be right and common sense tells me that ‚Äúcows in fields‚Äù on balance makes most sense. It seems to me that this is another of those animal welfare issues where in a few years time we‚Äôll all be wondering how we could have allowed it to happen ‚Äì think battery hens  They‚Äôve told me that I can shop at Waitrose because they guarantee all of their milk supplies come from cows that graze in fields and to be honest with my kids in mind thats what I‚Äôm going to do. I think you‚Äôre dairy development group might have got a bit too distracted with what‚Äôs efficient for farmers and your needs and not enough on what your shoppers and mums like me expect ‚Äì why can‚Äôt you just say you will only take milk from cows that are allowed to graze (at least for half the year) ‚Äì surely its that simple , milk production doesn‚Äôt have to be complex  - its being made complex.;2016-10-12T11:51:26+0000;1

No taste at all, compared to the above mentioned. Shame i live so far away from my roots lol. Looks like i'll have to return there more often. Thanks anyway for replying. Maybe it's worth giving it a try in other stores rather than keeping it local. Stottie Cake too. Nothing nicer than Pease Pudding and  carved Ham on Stottie. Such a versatile food.

At customers service i gave my order no and was asked for my bank card which I used to pay which I did not have. So as an alternative I asked if they would accept my email notification of my order or my bank card I had with me . The answer was no on both counts I had to get my bank card. When I arrived home and went through the collection what to take it reads as follows Your order no The payment card you used to place this order  If someone else is collecting on your behalf they must bring your order no  your billing address or your billing postcode  When I contacted  the store they still argued that If someone collected it they still would need a copy of the original email conformation.This I offered to give them on my phone in the store. It seems that the staff in the Dursley  store don t know the company procedure. I.now have my order which was collected by a member of my family with just my order no and postal code. All the time and hassle that this has caused is unbelievable .

Today (6th October) I visited your store in Cheadle at around 1pm with my 4 month old identical twin girls. I was by myself and it was the first time I d been to a supermarket with them. The girls decided to have a meltdown while I was there! But an amazing employee of yours called Pam came to my rescue. She helped me finish my shop  arranged for a till to open  asked some other staff to load my items on the belt and pack it for me and then Pam walked me to the car  the whole time holding one of my babies so I could hold the other so they would stop crying.

The forecourt was full in seconds on reopening and I lost count of the cars that tried to get in for petrol only to turn around and go elsewhere. Nobody seemed to care that id waited, or apologized for it.. Saying only that 'it had to be done' and that they'd (I'm guessing the tech guys) been there all day. What I don't understand is why it couldn't be done overnight. As a retail manager myself, I know things can go wrong that jeapordise trading but because of that all our it upgrades are completed overnight outside of trading. And if it really couldn't have been helped then I think there's a lot more could have been done in terms of service and information. There were 3 members of staff that I could see inside the actual building who could have been visibly providing info to customers and/ or at least apologizing ... But they didn't once come out.;2016-10-05T18:37:32+0000;0

Unfortunately the van broke down and the lovely regular delivery man called her to assure her the store would be in touch first thing in the morning to re arrange delivery.  By 10.30am the store had still not called  so she called customer services and was put through to the store. The abrupt and unhelpful Delivery Manager said he knew nothing about it and hung up on my mum!   She cancelled her order and made the 30mile round trip to Lidl  carrying all the groceries herself but saving ¬£50! (Bonus)  But she still hasn t had her money YOU took off her on Friday refunded and NO apology. She s very loyal and a good customer.   Sort it out please.

I think a warning for that behaviour, plus Sainsbury to refund your mother and match the refund with a donation to Marie Curie would go some way towards making amends.;2016-10-05T09:27:32+0000;2

I was in your sainsburys local store on Victoria drive in Eastbourne. I was queuing to pay and your colleague (I think her name was Christina) was serving an older customer.  Not only had she packed the customers bags into bags that could be easily unpacked at home but she came round from the counter to put the bags into the customers wheeled shopping bag explaining what was in each bag. She spent time talking to this customer about how her week had been  her receipt as the customer had queries and general chit chat. At no point was this customer rushed or treated poorly. The colleague apologised for the delay and called another to serve me whilst she helped the first customer. It was lovely to see.

It should be free for any sainsbury s costumer  regardless of what we spend. Why would I pay for parking at this store  if I can drive a mile and be at Colliers Wood store for example  where I have a bigger store and free parking for costumers. It s cheaper to drive further than having to pay the parking fee at the Tooting Broadway store.

Ideally, we want to offer free parking to all our customers. Unfortunately we don't always own the land, which means you may get charged for this service. In some cases where we own the car park we've had to introduce a charge. This is due to people taking advantage of our free parking without using the store. The charges have been introduced to improve access to the store for our customers. Can you confirm which store you were visiting using the link here? http://bit.ly/21oWP3I. We'll pass on your feedback. Debs;2016-10-05T07:33:56+0000;0

I was gutted that these contain soya too.   10 to 14% of people with milk allergy are also allergic to soya but you don t cater for them in your free from ranges. When it comes to dairy alternatives my local sainsburys aint great. I do most of my food shopping with you  then get cheese substitute and affordable coconut based yoghurts (the ones you sell are ridiculously expensive and not as nice) from another supermarket. I m probably gonna have to start doing my full shop there cos as loyal as I am to you that loyalty can only go so far.

You may or may not be familiar with its layout  but there is an area away from the store which has Wales and West Utilities gas apparatus along side. Separating the car park and the apparatus is a wooden panel fence (I have be informed by a store member that the fence is Sainsbury s responsibility)  which is frequently the target of vandalism. This fence is constantly being smashed and bits of timber are strewn around. Your facilities contractor comes out to repair it  and it is immediately subjected to more vandalism. On Sunday afternoon  I was walking to your store with my 5 year old daughter past this area of the car park and a nail which was still attached to the piece of wood  that at one time would have been holding a section of fence up went into my daughters foot  resulting in an afternoon spent in Royal Gwent Hospital A&E department. As you can imaging this caused my daughter a great deal of pain and distress  She is now in quite a bit of discomfort and unable to put all her weight down on it.    We would like to see this wooden fence taken down and replaced with a more secure metal fence  which may not be as prone to vandalism and hopefully prevent any injuries to your customers who cross that part of the car park to use your store. The injury to my daughter was entirely preventable  if you didn t put profit over customer safety.

You may or may not be familiar with its layout  but there is an area away from the store which has Wales and West Utilities gas apparatus along side. Separating the car park and the apparatus is a wooden panel fence (I have be informed by a store member that the fence is Sainsbury s responsibility)  which is frequently the target of vandalism. This fence is constantly being smashed and bits of timber are strewn around. Your facilities contractor comes out to repair it  and it is immediately subjected to more vandalism. On Sunday afternoon  I was walking to your store with my 5 year old daughter past this area of the car park and a nail which was still attached to the piece of wood  that at one time would have been holding a section of fence up went into my daughters foot  resulting in an afternoon spent in Royal Gwent Hospital A&E department. As you can imaging this caused my daughter a great deal of pain and distress  She is now in quite a bit of discomfort and unable to put all her weight down on it.    We would like to see this wooden fence taken down and replaced with a more secure metal fence  which may not be as prone to vandalism and hopefully prevent any injuries to your customers who cross that part of the car park to use your store. The injury to my daughter was entirely preventable  if you didn t put profit over customer safety. If you would like to discuss this matter please private message me and I will forward you my contact details. I look forward to your prompt response. Please be aware that I will be contacting the local press to bring it to the attention of other users of your store  should your response be less than satisfactory.;2016-10-03T18:21:17+0000;10155283775454377_10155285656539377;pageowner;0;Hi there Emma, I'm so sorry your daughter was injured whilst visiting one of our stores.

As a mother of one I shop at this branch four times a week. I was in the disabled toilets changing my two year old daughter s nappy when I heard someone try to open the door. When she realised that there was someone in there she then started to pull at the handle and kick the door and then started to scream the most disgusting expletives. She said amongst other things   get the f**k out . For f**k sake get out of there. C**ts. I shouted that I had a child and that she needed to moderate her language but it only continued. She then stopped and I waited until I could be sure she was away from the door. As you can imagine I was upset and shaken as I do not want my daughter being subjected to that and as you can imagine she was terrified.  I then came out of the toilets and went to the till nearest and asked if anyone had heard the shouting and the abuse. I was told that they had but hadn t realised that she was shouting at someone. I find it quite shocking that if you heard someone shouting expletives you wouldn t call security or get up to investigate what was going on. I was then told that she was a regular who was known to them and whose behaviour was known to them.  Prior to going to the toilets I had actually left my shopping with a member of staff. I went to that member of staff and told her what had happened and she said that she would go to the  security guard and look at the cctv. I paid for my goods as soon as I could as I wanted to leave. I then was told by the lady who had looked after my shopping that the next step was that the manager would be spoken to and that I would be called with an update as to what action would be taken.  I was then told to go to customer services and the service from the lady at the till was lovely as I explained what happened. She then mentioned to her colleague Brendan who I was and he said without speaking to me  I ve spoken to her I am with another customer.  He had spoken to me in passing and I found his lack of acknowledgment rude. I would also like to point out that I saw a member of staff in a striped shirt who I asked if he was a manager and he said yes and when I explained what happened he said he had just come on shift but yes I should leave my details.   When Brendan finally got to me. He told me that  my feedback would be taken on board and that I shouldn t have been told that I would get an update on the situation and my complaint as they would just speak to the customer. I thought this was disgusting. I was not giving feedback on an item or making a suggestion I was reporting an incident and I would imagine that would be taken seriously because as I said even when I expressed to this woman that I had a child her abuse continued. I would of thought with the number of Mums and families this would not be someone that you would want in the store.  My details were taken begrudgingly and I was wished a nice day and that was dripping with sarcasm. I hope that this incident will be dealt with properly and swiftly and the severity of the situation acknowledged when the appropriate action is decided. I also expect to be contacted as I will have to think very carefully about shopping at your south woodford store otherwise.

Working nights in Glasgow you can see the huge amount of homeless people there. Instead of meaningless Christmas cards to work colleagues and bottles of wine I put ¬£300 aside to get essential items for 20 homeless women and 20 men.

Your order was placed on the 28/09/16 and I can see you received the email on the 02/10/16, which is the 2nd working day from your order being processed as weekends are none working days. This happens when a number of orders are placed within the same time frame. A refund is then processed and will take 3-5 working days to reach your account. Our website is updated every 24 hours therefore all items are subject to availability. I do apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused you. If you're unable to collect your parcel from store, you'll be refunded after 14 days which will take 3-5 working days to reach your account. If you require any further assistance please don't hesitate to contact me. Sam,;2016-10-03T07:26:16+0000;0

Laying off staff on the 30th of December is hardly the most humane thing to do  but given that this has become your closure deadline  at least do them the honour of not making them wear silly costumes over Christmas.  If your decision to close one of this town s most recognisable and necessary retail fixtures is profit-based  your calculations are at least a little off. Few people will be prepared to travel to Wolverhampton or Blackheath for the Sainsbury stores there. They will simply choose an alternative supermarket chain altogether.  What a great  great shame. We shop at your store three times a week  and we shall miss it.;2016-10-02T16:16:19+0000;10155279979544377_10155282696904377;pageowner;0;I can understand your frustrations with the closure of one of our stores Michael, unfortunately however we regularly review our stores and have to taken the decision to close this particular store.

This could go on and on and on. Well a short version of the Story was 1 off duty worker shouted from customer service desk to the kiosk telling them to stand up. As we were heading over to the kiosk I know the staff member and joking said yea you better stand up I am coming for my fagsüòÇ To then be rudely told by a Manger called Graham that she can shout what she like as she is his boss bare in mind she was leaving the store off duty. For him to speak down to me as if I was a silly wee lassie. Telling me that I am offending customers no customers around at this time.telling me I am talking to loud. BARE IN MIND STAFF ALREADY SHOUTED I was talking normal till he started totally downgrading me and speaking to me in a VERY UNPROFESSIONAL WAY I am very disappointed the way this member of staff spoke to me. And now sainburys is losing out on my custom till this is sorted out under no circumstances is this man getting away woth speaking to me like this never dream of gng to sainburys on a Saturday night yo be spoke to by a MANGER LIKE THAT.

Your staff member carried on with what he was doing although I had informed him that my meat was missing. After repeating myself a second time he shrugged his shoulders.

The meat that was picked  was put together with other items such as cooked meats and other items  half of my shopping unpacked although I requested bags. I think that your staff in store who pick this shopping need training in cross contamination.    The whole process was time consuming and very stressful  waiting in the car park for an hour.   Unpacking at home  I realise 17 items are missing from my shop. I ring up and speak with customer service and they tell me they will be in contact tomorrow and they cannot do anything until i have spoken with a manager.

I was even more disappointed when the lady on the cheeses raised my hopes and said they would be in at the end of November  and then said to her colleague   What is vegan?   The lady on customer services said that staff could not be expected to know what vegan meant if they didn t have anyone in their family who was vegan.  Then she said that they couldn t be expected to know about all religions (???).  Apparently  it s not part of staff training.  So  could you make this part of staff training?  And ..... would you let the staff at Sainsbury s in Eastleigh know about the range of  Free From  cheeses that you have just brought out.  You ll be glad to know that news of these are circulating fast on Facebook.  I m not a car driver  so would love to be able to find the cheeses in my Eastleigh store.  Thank you!  Oh  P.S.

I have witnessed varied numbers of youths outside on my regular visits to this store and I am thankful that its taken until now for me to witness an act such as this.

I do not care whether you may consider this local store to be of low risk to acts such as this  but your staff (and customers) very much need the added assurance of protection should this situation occur again  in fact I can promise that it will since nothing like that is unusual in our area.

I've contacted the store and the store have assured me that they have taken steps to prevent this from happening again. The store has been working with the local police and have set up patrol cars and mobile units to keep an eye on the store. They are also looking into getting a security guard to be based at the store. Rest assured, we are taking this matter very seriously, colleague and customer safety is our number one priority and we strive to make sure that all of our customers feel safe in our store.

I went to the Queens Road  Norwich  branch to pick up a load of platters for my sons 2nd birthday party. I already had a trolley which had my son in it and when I got to the counter to get the platters  they were in a separate trolley. A man behind the counter  who I believe was called David  pushed the platter trolley to the till  then helped me to my car and helped load it. This was really helpful  I don t know how I would have managed without him. Thanks;2016-10-01T18:22:02+0000;10155276907129377_10155279803229377;pageowner;0;Wow that's great feedback Nicola!

And I also appreciate the recent publication of your in-store food waste of 38,767 tonnes! It's great to see this transparency. But please go further and publish more info about food waste in your supply chains! An estimated 4.7 million tonnes is wasted on farms and in factories, before it even gets to the supermarket shelves, compared to only 0.2 million tonnes that occurs in supermarket stores. Based on Sainsbury's market share, this means Sainsbury's supply chain waste could be roughly 790,000 tonnes - over 20 times as much as its in-store waste. And far less of this is redistributed to charities. Please #stoptherot!;2016-10-02T11:05:35+0000;0

Also the mark up on gluten free is significantly higher than it is on non gluten free products. For example a brand of gluten free cereal is for sale in some smaller shops for ¬£1 but in major supermarkets it's ¬£3.79.  I don't imagine that the 30p extra is how much extra it is to produce it. I object to how little there is on offer and to make something suitable you have to pay extra. It isn't like this elsewhere and given Sainsburys profits they should cater for the majority of customers without passing on the cost with profit. I have no choice in what I can eat as I have an extreme allergy and I'm not fussy but it would be nice not to feel continually ripped off because of it. I would like to know what Sainsburys comments are.;2016-10-01T14:30:49+0000;0
