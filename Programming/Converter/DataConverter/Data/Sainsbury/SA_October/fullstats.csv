All I ever want when I walk into your store is a nice soft bit of fresh bread  you know... how it should be.  I ve been into various stores expecting somebody to have a noggin on them and explain to me the placement of your bakery next to the fridge!? ü§î nobody  as of yet has been able to solve this mystery. Can you guess why I m wondering who this mastermind is behind the fresh bread and fridge combo? You probably can t  otherwise the bread would not be next to the fridge.   I am begging you  please can you re-merchandise your bakery and separate it from your fridges  I m so tired of a hard bit of bread that I could knock my granny out with.   Also  if you decide to take my genius thought and put it into practise  I m kind of expecting a cut of the extra profits you re going to make.   If you wish to ignore this request  please could you provide me with an explanation as to why your merchandisers are so shocking at their job? (I m honestly not joking  I can t continue with these nightmares)  (I literally cannot believe I have felt the need to post this... but this is how serious I am set on this issue  you must throw away so much bread!)

I m fully aware that you use the nectar card as a way of collating info about your customer buying habits. You keep issuing vouchers that give 5 x nectar points for a ¬£20 transaction. If you did your job properly  you d know that I rarely spend ¬£20 or above in one transaction. This is because I m a single woman that doesn t drive and i can only carry so much.

I am really impressed and wanted to take the time to say so.  The store was clean  well lit  with pleasant staff and the car park whilst small has been well designed and seems a good size for the store. However  I would expect all of the above as standard.   What really made the store stand out for me was the fantastic (and well thought out) range of items available. I feel that I would be able to do the majority (if not all) of my weekly shop within this store which is not something that can be said of your competitors smaller stores.  I do hope you continue with this range of products in future. This store will now be my first stop for shopping.

However the one they had in stock was only for display. Very nice member of staff went and checked the stock situation at other stores in the region  he told me three shops were showing two in stock.  Didn t want to have a wasted journey so rang the first one  Brentwood  after 10 minutes another pleasant member of staff told me the stock on the system was wrong and they only had a display model. Rang Rayleigh Weir and it was same story. Finally we rang East Mayne and the answer was the same. Today I rang the Careline. Another pleasant member of staff checked stocks for me  going further afield (the three shops that had errors yesterday still had the same stocks showing). On his advise I rang the Sidenham branch because they had a stock of three showing. Guess what their system was wrong too. Tried to ring the on-line ordering number that the Careline operator had given but they were closed. What do I have to do to take advantage of this offer? So frustrating  how can their stock control be so awful in this day & age?;;;;;2016-10-29T13:27:58+0000;1477747678;2016-10-29 15:27:58;0;5;0;0;5;5;2;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ordered a package off eBay on Wednesday due for collection today. I hadn t heard anything about it being ready for collection so I thought I d pop down and see if it was there anyway. It was  great. But the lady couldn t give it to me as I hadn t received the code required for handover. She was very sympathetic and asked a colleague for help. The chap that came over was very defensive and aggressive towards me saying he won t do anything until I get an email. I then felt the need to apologise to the lady  Chantelle I think her name was  incase I had come across as aggravated to justify his attitude towards me. I called eBay up and they explained that I could indeed collect my parcel and that yourselves had to phone them via a direct line they supply. Your staff knew nothing of this! So I had to phone eBay back again and once I explained myself AGAIN to eBay  I had to pass my phone over to one of your members of staff. After 1 hour spent in your store I was finally allowed to get my parcel.  If your staff aren t trained on this system why do you offer it?! And the chap that got all aggressive and defensive with me had NO right as he clearly had no clue either!!!  Chantelle who dealt with me from the beginning and who spoke to the eBay staff member was fantastic and a real credit to your store. But my overall experience today has made me want to never step foot in that store again!  The service is supposed to be convenient and easy for people who work awkward shifts to collect their items on their way home from work. We shouldn t have to phone eBay ourselves on a premium rate number for them to tell your staff how to do their jobs!;;;;;2016-10-28T19:14:37+0000;1477682077;2016-10-28 21:14:37;0;4;0;0;4;4;3;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

At around 12oclock today she was shopping with my son (Aged 2) who was sat in the trolley and my nephew (Aged 6) when my nephew  did what all kids do  and ran off! My mum instantly went after him but obviously with a trolley and a 2 year old  my nephew was much quicker and she couldn t find him. By this point she was pretty panicked (she suffers from bad anxiety as it is) and went to your stores security staff for assistance. Only to be told that they don t have full view of the store and refused to even look at the footage they did have!! So she decided to go to your  customer service desk  for help  she was told they can t put out an announcement and the staff on the so called  help desk  were far from helpful  surely you must have a way of contacting staff on different areas of the store other than the stores intercom? Luckily she spotted him and got hold of him! I am so disappointed that your staff were so unhelpful! We re just very lucky that the wrong person didn t spot him and take him!!;;;;;2016-10-28T15:48:15+0000;1477669695;2016-10-28 17:48:15;0;10;0;0;10;10;1;9;9;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Thought we would try an online shop from Sainsbury for a change as we normally shop with  Waitrose. We spotted a deal online when you spend ¬£60 on your first you receive  ¬£18 off. We placed the order mainly for a PS4 game priced at  ¬£42.99 called Battlefield 1 and also food and some beer.When the driver arrived we were informed the game was out of stock.  The game was for a birthday present for tomorrow   as our delivery slot was between 9/10 pm its to late to buy it elsewhere. We sent the rest of the shopping back and apologised to the driver. I phoned the 0800 Sainsbury s number and spoke to a gentleman called Michael in Scotland who s attitude couldn t care less. He did say our money would be refunded within the next 7 days and boy I hope it is. No faith in Sainsbury s.

She then began chatting away to my daughter about how she likes to dye her hair pretty colours and listened intently when my daughter was telling her about wanting rainbow hair (but Mummy said no)  She finished the conversation by giving my daughter a high 5 and asked us if we needed any futher assistance.

Ruth your trading manager has no idea about customer service or how to resolve a simple complaint. Having already visited 3 stores to find no stock of a product on promotion I was delighted to find mumm champagne in stock  I took six bottles to the till where I challenged not being offers the 25% discount as detailed in your website against all wines and champagnes etc. The rest of the staff stood around glaring and sniggering which I found totally embarrassing  To add insult to injury Ruth kindly offered to keep the champagne until Wed when she felt the offer began  neglecting to mention that the current special offer would have expired and the full price of ¬£35 would be charged  so to get a 25% discount I have to pay ¬£15 per bottle more to then save ¬£8.75 ????  Hardly a saving as I d be spending ¬£90 more to allegedly save ¬£52.50 !!!  No saving at all just a scam by Sainsbury s  I spend  thousands of pounds a year with Sainsbury on groceries  fuel and clothing  after today s experience that will come to a dramatic end.  Not the publicity you want just prior to your busiest trading period   I await your response and suggestion of how you don t want this to escalate to your CEO office  I did try to speak to your store manager Dave Grayson but he was unavailable  sadly Ruth was the most senior colleague to speak to and continued to make matters worse.;;;;;2016-10-27T18:20:34+0000;1477592434;2016-10-27 20:20:34;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I buy 5 packets of  40gr Sainsbury s minced turkey thighs every week.  Have done for years.   This morning as I picked up the first packet  I noticed the plastic packaging was considerably bigger than it had been in the past.   What a waste was my reaction.   When I got to the till to pay for it I commented on this fact to the check out lady.   She looked at the back of the packet and asked how much the old pack had weighed.   I replied 400gr.   This is only 350gr now she told me.  So Sainsburys are charging me ¬£4.00 for only 350gr of minced turkey and packing it in a larger plastic box presumably to pull the wool over my eyes.   I wonder if anyone else has noticed this with items in their weekly shop.

Or perhaps the guy who designed the programme hasn t been paid and this is his revenge!  For the second week running the store seems to be full of harrassed looking shoppers  muttering that they can t find anything.  Nothing seems to be in any logical order any more - some items just stuck on a shelf because there was a space there!  Logical means finding tea  coffee and sugar next to each other in one aisle  found the tea and coffee but couldn t locate the sugar  so gave up!

The only reason I chose Sainsbury was the convenience. After paying the ¬£5 which I thought was expensive anyway  the photo booth decided to have a  system error  and shut down taking my money and not giving my pictures  whilst slightly annoyed by this major inconvenience  I assumed that staff in a store such as the size of this would be able to rectify the issue quickly allowing me to go elsewhere for pictures.  After speaking to a very nice woman on the self service  she kindly went to get a team leader. It is at this point that your customer service skills disappear  the team leader wandered off and came back with a piece of paper telling me to ring a number and they will send me a cheque for ¬£5!!   She also said that she can get a manager but theres no point because he will say the same. I still requested the manager. He eventually made an appearance with security guards in tow surrounding me on all sides telling me that I wasn t having my money back and if have to ring the number!! This is completely unacceptable!! If you want to run machines on your premises then you should take responsibility for them!! The manager advised me the this is not the first time it s happened and every customer is just as angry as me and yet can t explain why nothing has been done  maybe you could offer an explanation?   I would also like to know why Sainsburys couldnt give me the ¬£5 and they go through all the hassle and expense of ringing companies to get cheques sent out!!   Makes it even worse is that since my place of work is round the corner  me and the lads buy dinner at least 3 times a week and the owners use the cafe multiple times for business meetings.......  or they did anyway!!;;;;;2016-10-26T16:40:34+0000;1477500034;2016-10-26 18:40:34;0;9;0;0;9;9;4;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

This is absolutely shocking behaviour. I am guessing you are either trying to limit profit loss and using the toy sale advertising to just get people into store hoping they will increase their basket spend knowing the number of toys is limited. Or the supplier is funding the promotion and has placed caps on the amount that you can sell or they will fund.

First of all the staff on the fish/meat counter have become awful regarding customer service. The customers are left waiting quite a while  usually until they have finished their own conversations. I think  smiles  are last season as well. The original staff this year were lovely! Always remembered regular customers and constantly enthusiastic.  Secondly  I have made several requests regarding the store stocking more dairy free items. Such as your gary and vegan quorn products. I have been met with vacant expressions and uninterested staff. Who tell me to either travel 10/20miles to other stores to see if they have the products or just shop on line. That s it...end of conversation! I work 12 hour shifts in a hospital and quite frankly don t then want to drive a huge round trip just to get my shopping when there is a store around the corner from my house! I m allergic to dairy so really need dairy free alternatives. I have been buying the dribs and drabs that you do stock and making do. Until I walked into the local Tesco today  whom have doubled their fridge dairy free offerings. With a wide variety of products  most of which were close to selling out. Which shows there is demand for it! The store manager informed me that ranges would continue to expand over the coming months as well. So if Tesco are happily doing it why is there no sign of Sainsbury s bothering? There less than a mile difference between the stores in Bourne so I shall now be frequenting Tesco I think. üòï;;;;;2016-10-25T19:19:02+0000;1477423142;2016-10-25 21:19:02;0;7;0;0;7;7;1;6;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have 1 year old twins but never want to run the risk of going down to find there s no trolleys to put my babies in. I do home delivery 90% of the time but I have to wait for my husband to come home to leave the kids with him if I want to pop down. If there was more double trolleys I m sure it would please lots of parents. My local store is Lancaster.

I bought a 10 pack of boys briefs for my 6 year old  they were in the sale so more reasonably priced than normal. The pack was a size 9 to 10 year old size  my son has a lot of junk in his trunk so I always size up to spare everyone the horror of his cheeks escaping.  I get them home  and show them to him   they are awesome  he tells me. This morning  he opens up the packet and pulls on a pair. They are very snug. VERY snug. So I check the size and the label inside the pants says 6 to 7 year old size. He refused to take them off until bedtime too. He likes how they feel. He s autistic and sensory stuff makes his world happy. I m not sure what to do now? Do I return the whole pack including the worn pair (washed of course) or just the 9 unworn pairs? I m happy to exchange for the correct size if possible please.   I would normally check the size in store before buying but I had my 18 month old with me and I wanted to finish my shop quickly.  Also I m not sure what I ve done with my receipt  I ll try the depths of my bag but it maybe gone.

Last night (an hour before closing time  and as usual  very quiet) I found the open till - all good! I loaded my basket onto the conveyor belt  and usually with careful loading I can just about get it all on. The checkout staff are reluctant to start scanning until it s all loaded in case I don t get the rest on and slow down the timings on your computer. This time I had more and it took a degree in engineering to load it all on  tottering and wobbling as if the earth was shaking  I carefully balanced packet after packet on top of one another  (I can guess how Jenga was invented!) Bless the cashier  she was fast. Food flew past her bleeping machine. Parcels piled up on the other side as I frantically tried to stuff things in bags - no order  no cold with cold  no raw meat away from cooked - I simply had to ram things in as best I could to avoid the log jam building up. Please Mr Sainsbury  can you not find an optimum beep rate - too fast is worse than being held up. Particularly when I am the only customer at the till and it s not like going at a slower pace is affecting anything other than the cashier s score. Yours Exhausted;;;;;2016-10-23T13:37:02+0000;1477229822;2016-10-23 15:37:02;2;9;2;0;11;8;8;0;3;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

As we were driving home yesterday lunch time we decided to treat ourselves by shopping at Sainsbury‚Äôs (yes we view shopping at Sainsbury‚Äôs as a treat). We went in with our 2 year old son and thought let‚Äôs push the boat out and have lunch in your cafe. When we ordered the food we were told there would be a 20 minute wait which was fine  our son can manage 20 minutes of waiting! Unfortunately  when it got to 45 minutes  and everyone around us (including people who arrived after us) were getting their food and leaving  our experience had gone from a treat to stressful. Our son was a star but started to get inpatient and hungry so we asked a Sainsbury lady how long our food would be? She came back and told us our order was next  only for us to watch another table be served (they‚Äôd been there for considerably less time than us). Our food came and we ate quickly because we were all hungry and ready to get on with our Saturday afternoon. We left your store feeling stressed  disappointed and we just wanted to get out as soon as possible. We would have gone to you costumer service but we felt we‚Äôd wasted enough time in store and felt it was unfair on our son to ask him to wait again.;;;;;2016-10-23T12:28:21+0000;1477225701;2016-10-23 14:28:21;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We had to wait over 15 minutes at a till.  There was a couple already being served so we didn t think we would be long.  Bad mistake.  The lady on the till was scanning the items really slowly  then constantly stopping and having a conversation with the couple.  I don t mind people having conversations  but not when they have stopped working to have them and a queue is forming at the till.  When she finally got to serve us  there was no apology for having to wait.  We often use the near by Aldi at trent vale and never have to wait long at the tills and the staff work quickly on the tills.  Perhaps having to wait long at the tills is one way of making people to use the self service tills.  By the time we unpacked our shopping  my ice cream tub had already started to soften.;;;;;2016-10-23T10:29:59+0000;1477218599;2016-10-23 12:29:59;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have just had to telephone customer services for the second time in as many weeks because of items I have received going out of date the day after delivery. I have just spoken to a man from your CS who told me that the day after delivery isn t considered a  short shelf life but that seems pretty short to me! This morning I have received two salads  avocados  fish fillets and raspberries all with a use by date of the 24th and a packet of prawns with a use by date of today. There is nothing on the delivery note to let me know the early expiry date of these items so I don t know until the driver has gone and I ve unpacked the shopping. I am pretty sure that a few months ago these items used to appear on the delivery note giving me the option to refuse them. The prawns are now going into the bin and I have two salads that have seen better days so by tomorrow will be pretty inedible. I have just been refunded for the items but that s not what I want I would rather have food that I can use. It seems to be that the people who have their shopping delivered are getting all of the almost out of date items that your in-store shoppers don t want?;;;;;2016-10-23T10:07:14+0000;1477217234;2016-10-23 12:07:14;1;17;1;0;18;17;9;8;18;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

We get to the till for them to tell us it s a 20minute wait. Ok fair enough. We ordered an omelette and a breakfast sandwich and went to sit down. Nearly 10 mins later a colleague came over to say they had run out of omelettes. Right ok- bit annoying but I understand it happens in good service sometimes. The woman told me I had to queue up again to change my order. Again  annoying- there were around 15 people in the queue and she genuinely expected me to queue again to sort their issue out? So I went and stood near the entrance of the kitchen to wait for a colleague. The same woman came out again- I asked if she could simply swap it for something like a big breakfast and it would be fine. She said she would get her team leader out to speak to me. So again I waited  and the same woman came out again (not her team leader) and told me for the privilege of solving their stock issue I would have to pay 40p. Not only that  I would have to queue up to pay 40p to get my breakfast. Are you kidding me? I know it s only 40p and it s really not the biggest problem in the world but when a girl is hungry  a girl is hangry! We went to customer services for a refund as we clearly weren t going to get to speak to this mythical team leader she promised me  didn t even get a sorry there  just a confused look and not a clue what she was actually doing. We did get a refund  but she took our receipt from us as apparently to give us our receipt back  we needed to wait for a supervisor. I m sorry for the essay but actually I m pretty annoyed by your poor service this morning.;;;;;2016-10-23T09:42:37+0000;1477215757;2016-10-23 11:42:37;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We needed baby formula  Cow and Gate First Milk. No problem you would think  right?

This ring is of huge sentimental value to me and I was devastated when I noticed I had lost it some point between leaving our home in North Somerset and arriving at our holiday cottage in Motherby. One of the few places we had stopped was at your Penrith store to pick up some bits and pieces for our two-week holiday so we decided to pop back to the store the following morning on the off chance I had lost it there. I asked a very helpful lady on customer services if it had been found  to my utter amazement it had and I am so very grateful to the person who handed it in  I hope they might see this and be assured of my grateful appreciation.

Good quality  value for money  durability to name a few  however this is far from what I can describe the winter coat I have bought my 4 soon to be 5 year old.  Purchased in September ready for the school term  she didn t wear it right away because the weather was mild  but has been for the last 4 weeks. I m sure you will understand at her age clothes/coats get dirty quickly with all that playing out at break/lunch times  therefore as we were going away for half term I thought I d better put it in the wash! What a mistake that was!!! So this was yesterday  the coat is washed and dried all ready for our trip to the east coast! Fast forward to today  we are all sat here full of fluff from this malting coat! Not happy at all  it s attached itself to everything  my little girls dress and tights are covered  my black leggings look white and it s even all over grandad!!!! So I have just had to go purchase a new winter coat!! As I can t have my little girl going out covered in fluff  her school uniform is blue and black!!

We don t like to complain but last night  the Bourne store had a number of issues with products not available  especially within fresh food. Other items were pushed to the back of shelves  making it difficult to reach them. Apparently this is to help with stocktaking that is taking place this weekend. Appreciate that this needs to be done but surely not at the expense of sales. The store does not carry the most extensive range of products at the best of times due to its size. My mum was not able to get a number of items as part of her weekly shop so she is not too happy! Just wanted to make you aware.

But almost all stores will only sell a maximum of two packs at a time.  Analgesics (such as ibuprofen) are limited to 2 packs per customer unless you seek the permission of a pharmacist.  These drugs are NOT the same  and while there is guidance in place to suggest that stores could signage selling only packs at till points (which incidentally  you don t have) there is no legal reason why I cannot purchase 2 packs of each - 64 tablets. The only actual legal limitation in general tablets sale is that you cannot sell more than 100 tablets at a time.  So  in your Hedge End store this morning  I did not appreciate being told  it s the law  that I was unable to purchase 32 ibuprofen and 32 paracetamol. Both very different medicines  the same laws and guidance do not in fact apply to both of them  and the total was well inside the legal limit.  The till person then called over a supervisor  who just agreed with the cashier and I was forced to purchase only one of each. Not only is this refusal wrong  and the information provided by your staff incorrect  I normally have absolutely no issue purchasing this quantity anywhere - including this same store which I use regularly at weekends.  Either you re normally wrong to sell me this or you were wrong this morning  which is it?  My suggestion would be that the staff in stores be made aware of the actual legislation limits when attempting to communicate a refusal of sale to a customer  and also to treat said customer with manners and respect  as opposed to how I was spoken to this morning.;;;;;2016-10-22T10:20:29+0000;1477131629;2016-10-22 12:20:29;0;5;0;0;5;5;1;4;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Your colleague BEN from mansfield store delivered shopping tonight (430-5.30pm)  to my dad a new sainsburys online customer. I wanted to share how polite  helpful and informative he was. Even though I was there and knew this.. he went out his way to explain the 25 policy  bags  colours of the bags  substitutes and if he wasn t happy.  I felt he took his time to explain and was very cheerful. He was a credit to your team.

I went to the checkout to purchase a few items including baby formula. My mum had given me a ¬£1.50 off coupon to use on shopping for ¬£15 or more. My total came to just over ¬£15 so i handed the coupon over. The cashier could not get the voucher to scan so shouted over to his colleague at the next till why it wouldn t scan. To which the young cashier asked what I had purchased. I showed her it will baby milk to  which she then replied  ah you can t use that voucher on baby milk as sainsburys only promote breastfeeding . This comment totally upset me as she has no idea why I cannot breastfeed. It did not bother me that I couldn t use the voucher but the comment was totally unnecessary and left me feeling guilty and embarrassed.   Surely it could have been phrased differently and not mentioning breastfeeding. This whole experience has left extremely upset and embarrassed and I will definitely think twice about buying from Sainsburys in the future.;;;;;2016-10-21T19:24:54+0000;1477077894;2016-10-21 21:24:54;18;37;34;16;87;37;12;25;76;0;18;0;0;0;0;16;0

I phoned this morning the Crayford store after ringing around 8 other Sainsbury s this really was my last option. To see if they had a specific toy that had previously been in thurrock toy sale but not been in since (Wednesday) after going to beckton yesterday Hornchurch also on Wednesday etc. The staff member from customer service kept me on the phone for 5 mins whilst he checked and said he would go and check told him the brand and exactly the name of said toy. Yes he said we have 10 available. Rush around getting my baby dressed and out the door 10 minutes after the phone call.  I live in Essex so had to go over the dartford crossing took me an hour because of several diversions and traffic. To get there and no said toy in sight. Go to customer services who I had phoned earlier to check if I just couldn t see it and they hadn t even got it on their system!

Their reasoning was because they don t get a lot of twins in or have a use for them üò≥ When I asked what I was supposed to do they said I could always use their  double baby trolleys  as they have several of those!! 1. Why have several double baby trolleys if you don t get many twins in?! 2. What about mums who have a baby and a toddler? 3. How the hell am I going to squeeze my 9 1/2 month old twins into the tiny baby seats?! 4. Why is that lady using a double trolley when she s got no children?

I m feeling a little disappointed after I a delivery on Sunday and ordered it without bags  and when it came the guy who delivered it just stood outside my front door with it and didn t even offer to help take the trays off the stacks. It would have been much more helpful if he d even just taken the stack through on the wheels through the hallway to my kitchen so I could have unloaded everything there  as carrying each one through individually myself was really heavy. I didn t want to opt for bags because I think they re a waste  but if your staff are going to be that unhelpful then if I was going to order from you online again then I would have to opt to use bags and add to landfill waste to make things easier to carry albeit delaying your drivers time by taking a few individual items at a time off of the crates and carrying them through rather than the large heavy crates. I purposefully ordered an online delivery so that I could do a bigger shop and also get some of the heavier things that are too heavy for me to carry myself. Alternatively the more attractive option right now seems to be to order from places like Tesco  who promise to take your shopping right to your table.

Yesterday my 2 year old daughter ate the gel from the inside of one of your nappies  she wasn t in any distress so I called customer services to check if the nappy contained any toxins than I should worry about. The gentleman I spoke to said he needed to pass the details on to the communication department which usually get back within 5 days?!!! He assured me that because of the nature of the situation they would call back within 2 hours....27 hours later and I have still had no call back. I did find out from her Dr that there was nothing to worry about as the gel was wet when she ate it so it wouldn t swell inside her and it wasn t toxic but I think the lack of communication from Sainsburys on this matter is very disappointing.;;;;;2016-10-20T17:20:50+0000;1476984050;2016-10-20 19:20:50;3;7;3;1;11;7;4;3;3;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

Is it company policy to refuse legal tender  in whatever form it comes? I would have understood a reluctance to count these if the shop was busy  but Saltburn is a quiet little town and there must have been 10 other people at most with none of them queuing at the kiosk where I was. Times are hard for a lot of people  and sometimes we have to do things like this. The lady behind the counter shouted down the shop to check whether she could accept the money  which was embarrassing  and this was confirmed by another lady. This being the case  I took my custom to the Spar shop down the road  who were happy to take my change. I felt I was treated like a second class citizen because I wasn t paying with crisp ¬£20 notes.

Unfortunately I didn t catch the driver s name but I was impressed at his level of customer service and at the fact that he arrived in good time (7:45pm in a 7:30pm to 8:30pm slot).  The road I live on is unfortunately extremely narrow and delivery drivers tend to just block up the road (infuriating my neighbours in the process üôÑ) but the driver tonight parked down the road and with consideration.  He took the time to explain the substitution process and also explained how I could hand back any substitutions to him. He also explained and handed me some other offers that would be available after my delivery today and even took the time to help check my delivery was ok and encouraged me to do the same.  It d be great if these comments could be passed on.   I won t hesitate to recommend you and will definitely be back online again very soon üòÉ;;;;;2016-10-18T19:04:57+0000;1476817497;2016-10-18 21:04:57;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Every so often it disappears  and after a protest rom customers and much confusion as to who has made this decision  it appears again. It is now no longer available. I asked at the bakery why. I gathered from the response that they are asked this many times. The answer was that they are no longer allowed to make it. Same response at customer services. This is the biggest complaint in my local store.  I would suggest for every customer who does ask  many more just accept it.  What exactly is the problem? Are you making too much profit? Is somebody employed just to upset customers? It just beggars belief that one product that is so popular is withdrawn. I have been told that this is now the final time. Sadly then  this will be the final time I shop at Sainsburys. Yes  it is available in the other shape  but I don t want that. For me it is the only item that makes Sainsburys different to all the other supermarkets and the reason why I went there despite having a Tesco and Lidl nearer. If you are refusing to sell it  then there is no point in trekking across town. I suspect you have lost other customers who also feel the same way. What a way to run a business!;;;;;2016-10-18T16:42:11+0000;1476808931;2016-10-18 18:42:11;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Last week I thought I had purchased a PS4  chosen delivery date and confirmed payment.  Until I got an email the day before to say the order had been cancelled.  Not only that but after you cancelled the order you proceeded to text me to tell me my order would still be with me the following day.  As if this was not already bad enough  my girlfriend tried to purchase an Xbox one.  I was reluctant to let her do this  because of what happened earlier in the week  however I decided to bite my tongue and let her proceed.    The order was due to arrive yesterday evening  guess what? It didn t!  So my girlfriend rang to query where the delivery was and was told it would be here this evening.  Guess what?  It didn t come! Why?  Because apparently again it was out of stock  so we where able to re-arrange a delivery for something that was never coming in the first place!? Not only was it not coming  you couldn t even have the decency to make us aware.  I think you need to restructure you re whole online system.  You are miles off the quality of your competition.  I would recommend to anyone ordering a non perishable item  to stay well clear of Sainsbury s! I certainly will be  so I don t have the concern of further disappointment!!!!;;;;;2016-10-17T20:02:28+0000;1476734548;2016-10-17 22:02:28;2;15;2;0;17;15;9;6;14;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was in Kingsgate  East Kilbride store this evening - about 6.30pm when my autistic son started to have a meltdown.  He started to bounce a basket ball all around your store and running away from me.  I approached your security guard to advise him that my son was having a meltdown and could he get a manager  to which one of your managers attended straight away.  I explained what was happening and that he might run around the store and pull things off the shelf and rather than look blank or annoyed (which is usually what my experience is) he said the magic words  what can we do to help . He saw Kieran bouncing the ball and approached him to talk to him  but he ran away. I went after Kieran to try and calm him down and when I was approaching him I could see the manager and a colleague walking towards us  Kieran was cowering and was really scared (enviroment  noise  strangers etc) but his colleague asked Kieran if he would like to play basketball with her and her manager to which Kieran replied yes.  They played for a couple of minutes and then I took his hand.  The manager then asked Kieran if he would like to take the basketball home   to which I replied that was too much and that he had a basketball at home.  He offered again and I said yes  and Kieran said thank you took my hand and walked out of the shop.  I am so grateful for your staffs patience  care and compassion for my son in what is a really distressful time for us both.  I will not forget this.  Unfortunately in all of the stress I didnt get the manager or his colleagues name  but they deserve recognition for what they did for a wee scared boy.

We are creatures of habit and have been buying your Sainsbury s Unsalted English Butter 250g for over a year at 85p for a 250g block.   We are a little startled this evening to find that it has increased in price to ¬£1.10. We appreciate that prices increase  but it seems odd to us that a price remains unchanged for a year and then increases by NEARLY ONE THIRD in one go.   Is there a reason for this extraordinary price hike? None of your competitors seem to have increased their butter prices like this.   We had such a time working out which supermarket was most fair to British farmers  so we really don t want to have to start researching all over again to find some butter which a) we can afford and b) which is made with a fair price paid to British farmers for their milk.  Please tell us this is a computer glitch and the price will return to an affordable level!;;;;;2016-10-17T17:39:03+0000;1476725943;2016-10-17 19:39:03;3;2;3;0;5;2;2;0;2;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

So no longer when I visit will I get to eat unsalted anchor spreadable butter on my taste the difference crumpets. It saddens me that this terrible state of affairs happened over the simplest of errors. On one of my mother s many weekly deliveries - the delivery driver broke the wine THE WINE!! I mean that in itself is the most unreasonable of acts. What ensued was beyond nonsensical. A back and forth conversation which exceeded all realms of reason. To conclude - my mother never received the refund for the damaged delivery due to the catastrophic ending of the innocent Sauv Blanc s life . A mere ¬£20!  This in proportion to the ¬£100+ my mother would spend weekly was just not worth the fight.  However - You have now lost with this ridiculous set of events - 3 weekly shoppers all in excess of ¬£100 per week)  This nonsense happened in April - I feel sure that you have an accounts department that can work out the sales value that was lost due to this series of unfortunate of events.  Perhaps the accounts department could poke their head around the door of the customer service department and see if there is anyone other than the paid monkeys in there.  I know My mother  my sister and my move to Ocado will not have significantly affected your bottom line and I can eat Lurpak and Warburton Crumpets - It is just a sad state of affairs when I company that prides itself of striving to be different.  Remains boringly mediocre and average.  To add to the sadness - my grandmother was one of the original Sainsbury s customers when you used to have to line up for either Bacon or Cheese...

I ordered my shopping on Thursday to be delivered on Friday 14th in the evening  I received a pho all Friday morning to say that you had a driver phone in sick and you would not be able to get my shopping to me  I was a bit annoyed but knew it couldn t be helped. I was told that my shopping would be with me the next morning  my shopping was delivered but a crate was missing ! A bit fed up but the delivery driver called the store on my doorstep and explained to them some of my shopping was missing. The sore told him that they would get my shopping out to me by 6pm that evening..... 6.30pm came and no shopping !! So I called the contact centre and got through to somebody who clearly didn t want to be at work  wasn t helpful and I was kept on hold for 20 minutes and then had to repeat everything I said to him the first time  he said he was speaking to the store  he told me there was no record of my missing shopping and I had to re-order the missing items one by one on the phone with him  I was on the phone for over 40 minutes. He then said my items would be out to me this morning first thing but he couldn t give me a time. So once again I wait in for my shopping  thinking I ll just get a refund and go get the bits myself  by 1pm today still no shopping !! I AGAIN call the contact centre  go through all of the story again  get put on hold again  to be told ....... Guess what no record of my shopping coming out to me !!!  This person was slightly more helpful and gave me a name of the store manager and a phone number and said if I m not called back within the hour to call the store manager. Yes I had to call myself as no one called me  the store manager was very helpful and kept me on the line while he went into what I could hear was the delivery department as he spoke to someone who said that yes they had my shopping  yes it was going onto one of the vans and yes I would get my shopping today. I asked if I would 100% get my shopping today as I didn t want to be mucked about anymore I would go get the bits myself  but he assured me the shopping was on its way too me. Told me that I would have it by 4.45pm today. 5pm today ........ STILL NO SHOPPING !! So I call the store AGAIN went through the whole sorry story again  to be told that the shopping did go out on the van but guess what ....... Didn t have an address on it so it got took back to the store üò°üò°üò°üò° no one called me  nothing  you have my number on my account as you ve called me numerous times before when you want to deliver early or your going to be late !! In the end the lady on the phone got her college in the office to personally drive my shopping too me. He had nothing to do with the online delivery  I m very grateful to him and told him so when he knocked on my door. I have never ever come across incompetence at this level and I m so so angry that it s took 3 days to get my shopping. This has done nothing but cause me pointless phone calls and a headache !! Seriously fed up ! Oh and I was offered ¬£5 compensation for all my troubles !! Ha REALLY I paid a ¬£4 delivery fee !!

I pointed this out at Customer Services but the woman I spoke to just didn t take my complaint seriously.   She actually laughed and said  yes it is very cold  it s because there are workmen doing work in the store. What???  What are they doing actually? Turning down the thermostat?

I was there this morning at around 11am. I am a registered blue badge holding disabled customer and am becoming more frustrated at the misuse of disabled parking at this branch. Please let me make it clear  on the whole I have no problem with the staff  who often go out of their way to be helpful  but to the lack of  policing  and action over parking misuse there. This morning as I was parking and hoisting out my mobility scooter  2 young girls in their 20 s (in my estimate) parked in the space the very nearest to the entrance and walked in perfectly well  laughing and arm in arm. I went to check and found there to be no badge on display and no evidence in the car of mobility item (walking stick for instance) - so I used my car to park behind them and block them in - I had to come back to my car half way through my light shop as I had left my vouchers in the car and found a member of car park staff looking over my car and when I showed myself I was berated for parking as I had  I moved my car but was surprised to note from the windows inside the store he didn t bother to even speak to the girls when they returned! I made a complaint to the duty manager  who was most understanding  as previously at this store I have seen young people using elderly peoples badges  it s easy to read the code on the badge once you know how  and even when you have a company there with a promotion they have been know to park their large van in disabled spaces! Please note that in the news this week  your competitor p  Tesco  are now to start fining people ¬£70 for wrongly using disabled parking  for this reason many disabled people are considering using a company that really does care about ALL its customers....;;;;;2016-10-16T11:45:12+0000;1476618312;2016-10-16 13:45:12;2;5;2;0;7;5;4;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

There is always always items missing and then last minute trip the shops to get items needed for a recipe. Training urgently needed for packers and random replacements. Today rather than grated light cheese - I got full fat block cheese and to add insult to injury you charged me 19 packs. Yes 19.  Surely the options of other lighter cheese would be more sense. Rather than black dye - replaced with colour catcher. That s a joke.  Plus list of other replacements.  Fruits are often already ripe or going off. Actually had a packet of biscuits that are out of date once. Biscuits...how old must they have been. Never never have this problem with Ocado. I only use Sainsbury s now when Ocado is booked up.   Disappointing. I want my money back for the 19 blocks of cheese. Plus crazy replacements.

When I went to the customer service desk to add the points to my card I was told that as I had thousands in points that it couldn t possibly be right and that the lady behind the desk had to enquire as to whether she could add the points to my card. She was told that this was the case but as she started to add my points  with no hint of customer service whatsoever I might add  she kept on telling me that this wasn t right and it shouldn t be allowed. When I stated that I had correctly paid for shopping worth ¬£10 or more to receive each voucher I was still met with a tirade of  well it s not right  shouldn t be allowed  I asked her what the issue was as it wasn t her money I was taking and she said  yes it s my wages ! This continued until I asked if she personally had a problem with me using the promotion as it was prescribed when she suddenly made a u-turn and said that she didn t have a problem with me personally using the is promotion but there was obviously a loop hole that needed to be closed.   I don t expect to legitimately make use of a promotion in store to be met with this kind of personal tirade just because a member of your staff doesn t agree with it.

But no! Great selection of sandwiches in the meal deal? No! Sushi in the meal deal? No! Instead a much more limited selection of boring sandwiches. No BLT  no more of the ham hock and mature cheddar  no prawns and rocket. That means none of us had a meal deal.   Or rather none of us had a Sainsbury s meal deal. Over the road to Tesco (who I don t normally like to shop with) and guess what? A great selection of sandwiches all in the meal deal. So three happier people  some added extras that I would have bought in Sainsbury s and home I go.  Why oh why have you devalued what was a great meal deal?

Sainsbury say that  Healthy oceans are vital for our planet  So why do they continue to sell this brand when their own brand is caught by pole and line fishing? Tesco and Watrose have already started to remove it from their shelves and I would like to know why CEO Mike Coupe of Sainsbury  s is not replying on this issue. After all it s the 2nd largest supermarket chain. Thousands of people including myself are very disappointed with Sainsbury  s and will not use it until they practice what they preach.

Made purchase received confirmation email for price of ¬£263.99 now at 8.45pm the day before my delivery is due I was called to tell me they are cancelling the order because of high demand. I will not accept this as a valid reason if that was the case they shouldnt have offered and accepted my payment. Then I called them to which they offered little understanding saying its a stock issue these items are in constant circulation and are restocked constantly they didn t even offer me an alternative delivery date. I feel totally mislead and then lied to over the phone. I would have never entered my personal details into this website if it wasnt for the for said deal again I feel tricked into giving away my details something I don t take lightly. I sat on hold for 15 mins then kept repeatedly being put on hold. If this companies software/website is misleading people to the point where they are having to deal with high cancellations because they cant honor what they confirm then it should not be running. Although staff were polite I would have expected them to have honored the deal whilst i made my complaint  totally ridiculous to leave your staff in such a vulnerable position having to deal with totally unreasonable situations as a customer it was distressing and i can imagine to any reasonable thinking member of staff the situation would have been equally distressing. As a first experience of shopping with Sainsbury s online it was a horrific and stressful one I really should not have to be explaining the principles of false advertising or misleading customers to your staff to the automated response of we cant do anything all our orders are subject to availability. I had visited both the Hazel Grove branch and the Stockport branch that day and all items were in stock.  To action this I would like you to I purely want fair resolution I want the offer honored I am happy to collect from any local store. I would be happy to collect it Saturday or it to be delivered Saturday. I actually cant believe how bad an experience I have had with this.

I buy a punnet of berries two or three times a week to have with breakfast  but this week I noticed that everything has shrunk but stayed the same price! I just spent ¬£2 on 150g of blackberries  when I used to get more like 200g for the same price. You ve also apparently done away with the 400g punnet of strawberries at the Great Portland Street Sainsburys.  These berries are a treat and also part of a healthy diet I strive to maintain  and you ramping up the prices honestly is going to stop me doing this soon.

Come on  get real  we re vegetarian/vegan because we have more respect for animals than to eat them - we certainly don t want our food sharing contamination space with animals that have been killed well before their natural life-expectancy and by having a metal bolt fired through their brains.   3  The Sainsbury s own brand vegetarian stuff has been repackaged so that both vegetable items and meat substitutes all look the same and are mixed in haphazardly.  This means spending ages trying to sort out the type you want.  4  Sainsbury s own brand  escallops  are not there  despite me asking before and being assured they d be back - cheaper and tastier than the Quorn equivalent.  5  A manager told me that we d be getting vegan ice-cream in - none there and no space for it.  In fact the entire frozen desert range seemed to have been reduced to virtually nothing compared to before.  6  The positioning of the freezers - moved to the very back of the shop where the baby products/soaps etc used to be.  Have a heart for those of us with mobility disabilities and/or lack of time.  Nearly everyone buys frozen stuff regularly  baby products are a niche item and you don t need soap  deodorants  toothpaste etc every visit.  Where the freezers were before you could then cut back diagonally to the tills that are open - now you have to walk the full length of the shop to get to the freezers and the full length to get back.  I know why you ve done it - so that we have to walk past the end of the aisles with their tempting offers  so once again you put profit over the needs/comfort of your more vulnerable customers.

That is exactly what you have done to me. Having ordered your PS4 Fifa17  bundle deal  for ¬£239 less than a week ago  what a surprise I got when it was delivered yesterday to be told that FIFA 17 was out of stock. Ok these things happen however how on earth can you then think you can charge me the cost of a PS4 on its own at ¬£259??? That s right folks I have got LESS goods than I ordered however I am expected to pay MORE for the privilege ?? Someone is clearly taking the mickey out of their customers. Call our contact centre and they will sort you out the driver said ....... JOKE. 20 mins on the phone today to be told that you couldn t keep up with the demand  that the delivering store sold out of Fifa17 over a week ago which was prior to when I even placed the order so this was never going to be honoured let s be honest  that the deal has now finished so I will not be getting sent Fifa17 when it comes back into stock and that I have 2 Options. Option 1 ....... I can keep the goods I have been delivered and pay THE INFLATED PRICE hahahahaha I am still laughing that this was a serious suggestion or option 2 I can return the goods for a refund. No surprises on what is coming back your way tomorrow then! What a great example of sticking 2 fingers up to your customers so congratulations. #PAYMOREFORLESS;;;;;2016-10-12T20:55:50+0000;1476305750;2016-10-12 22:55:50;12;5;14;0;19;5;5;0;2;0;12;0;0;1;0;1;0

My partner has just put lunch on  yay! Being 32 weeks pregnant I have the appetite of a large pig. But this is where the problem starts.   So I m sat on the sofa  relishing in the sight of my 10 month old sleeping peacefully on my lap when my partner shouts from the kitchen  there s only 16 chicken nuggets . As this is not an immediate cause of concern for me I reply  yeah...and?    There s supposed to be 20. Sainsbury s have ripped us off!   Well  as you can imagine I m pretty gutted and upset. My hormones are all over the place as it is and for something like this to happen  well it damn near tips me over the edge.  Also as a result of this my family has significantly less food to eat at lunch and will probably have to have something more. Which then will result in another trip to Sainsbury s even sooner than thought. So as well as ripping us off by 4 chicken nuggets you are also going to be making more money out of us.  I really hope this doesn t happen again as we may be forced into using a more reputable source if chicken nuggets in future.  Yours  A very disappointed and nearly broke family.;;;;;2016-10-12T12:33:28+0000;1476275608;2016-10-12 14:33:28;1;15;1;0;16;15;3;12;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

But I can only say one thing this man Graham has got away with it basically been told naughty boy don t do that again. As he did say to use that no discipline action will be taking about this.

Great I thought ! I will certainly be buying these!  Until tonight! Tonight I have a poorly baby! He s rocking a temperature over 39 degrees  it s 10pm and he s awake crying again for the third time in three hours  I notice his nappy is ridiculously full so I decide to change it  I grab the pack of little ones I used last night and there is two left in the pack. Great I think! I strip his wet nappy off him ( now I don t know if the designers of nappies have ever wrestled an alligator but I m sure that s pretty much compared to trying to get a hysterical baby through a nappy change)   I get the new nappy and a minute later we re almost successful but on the final sticky tab we fall at the last hurdle. It rips clean off - it s like it s just been stuck on the nappy gahhh frustration i grab the second and final nappy in the pack - still putting my faith in these nappies  meanwhilst the twisting screaming hysterical one has rolled away to the other side of the bed! Grrr more frustration  right grab the baby  grab the nappy #round2 ha ha I think clever me keeping three nappies upstairs ( yesterday s and today s) and low and behold at the final hurdle against snaps clean off - straight lines no tears just like it pulled straight off! Rargh! Frustration !!! I know have a screaming poorly twisty baby naked on the bed and no nappies to put on him! The rest are downstairs !! So making sure he s secure I run as fast as I can down the stairs grab the nappy and like an Olympian I m running back up the stairs and through the safety gate in seconds.  Seconds it took me. Almost as many seconds as it took him to wee all over my bed!  So thank you Sainsbury s your nappies are super absorbent ( much like my bed) but I will not be recommending or using them if 2 out 3 snap the sticky fasteners off.  Maybe it s worth mentioning to the nappy designers that not all babies lay still whilst you change nappies and strong sticky sides may be needed if in doubt try and wrestle an angry baby into a nappy   Love from one stressed out mummy.;;;;;2016-10-11T21:16:41+0000;1476220601;2016-10-11 23:16:41;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was supposed to receive an xbox one s last night for my son s birthday  however after the delivery slot came and went I then spent 20-30 mins on the phone to various people trying to sort it out. Turns out that there wasn t any in stock and that it was never going to be delivered.  So while I was on the way home from work today my son took a phone call from someone at Sainsburys who left a message my son about delivery of an xbox. So the surprise that was supposed to be for his birthday (something I told to the person I spoke to last night) is now no longer a surprise.  So now not only do I not have an xbox I also now have a son who knows what he s having for his birthday!

Witnessed a visibly and extremely intoxicated man hurling verbal abuse at shoppers of other ethnicities and behaving in a threatening manner towards shoppers while staff just laughed about it and actually seemed to enjoy this behaviour. They were engaging in conversation with him which leads me to believe he is a former employee or a current employee off duty. This is abhorrent and shocking! No manager on site to control this and no security to escort the man out. At one point he sidekicked a member of staff (although not violently) and staff were unfazed not only by how inappropriate this was but also completely oblivious to shoppers staring at their blatant unprofessionalism. Staff need SERIOUS training and major investment needed in management and security.

Yesterday I walked into my local store and they had new big signs at the end of the aisle saying that they were now half price. I looked everywhere but I couldn t see any so I asked the staff about them. No one seemed to know what they were and suggested that they didn t stock them. When i pointed them out on the sign they confirmed they hadn t had any but said the sign was there to advertise and it did say while stocks last. I understand this so I asked since the sign had gone up had they had any stock to which they replied they hadn t. So my question to you sainsburys is why would you put large end of the aisle posters up advertising fisher price beat bos at half Price in store s that had never received any stock since they went up?

Unfortunately despite not being cheap  the quality of the meat was awful  so much so that I had to leave over half of the steak as it was full of gristle and fat and the bits I did eat were very tough and chewy. We normally are very happy with your products but on this occasion we are extremely disappointed. I would welcome some feedback about this as it will certainly put us off visiting the butchers there in future.

It was hidden away in some other aisle that I never visit  near the ready meals etc that I never buy cos I cook from scratch. I suggest  if you want to get an accurate measure for it s demand  that you move it beside the cheese as that s where people will expect to find it. I know of several people who visited Coleraine store to get it and left with none cos they didn t ask.

I bought some skinless chicken thighs from the fresh section. When I got home and opened them they were frozen. I called the store in tower bridge road and spoke to the manager he said he would be happy to refund  them.  My question why was fresh meat frozen in a chiller cabinet.  He said the fridge was too cold and a customer had already complained about it this week. He also said it happens to their salad.  I asked why don t you adjust the fridge he said it was done centrally .  What I fail to understand is a) why hasn t the temp been changed if you already know abou it? B). If the fridge is freezing produce why are you still using the fridge when you know it s an issue.   He said it s fine to eat.   I didn t want to take the chance as if it s in a fridge now too cold where was it before.

I complained and was due a call back and never got one so I called up and was told that if we ordered again you would basically dump it at the fence. Our garden is long by the way.

Thats why I only wanted two packets. It seems I can only buy two packets of any medication. It would be really useful if you tell you staff what your policy is and perhaps put up a sign by the medicines.

I moved to Salisbury because of a divorce and moved in to sheltered housing.    Now yes there are people with problems here.   So when shopping I started to notice that the security guard was following me.   So I asked him an he said it was because of ware I live.   And information from tescos.     I asked tescos and they said they have never had a problem with me.     So he s discriminated me because of ware I live.     Days later I go back to Salisburys do my shopping.  And yes I did say hello joey as I was annoyed at being marked a criminal.    He then tells me that I am a rent boy.  And bands me from the store.  Well telling other customers that I m a drug addicted alcoholic. ??????      Wendsday about 3:30;;;;;2016-10-07T22:12:54+0000;1475878374;2016-10-08 00:12:54;1;3;4;0;7;3;3;0;13;0;1;0;0;3;0;0;0

I felt the need to explain this as it hopefully will help you understand my confusion.   Today approaching lunch time I was starting to feel somewhat peckish and was wondering what delights I could find to satisfy my hunger  when in the distance I spied the orange glow of one of your supermarkets  it looked so inviting that no matter how much I tried I could not resist the temptation and soon found myself entering your store. I was greeted with so many different options I felt somewhat overwhelmed  I perused the shelves looking for something to satisfy my hunger when I spied the holy grail which would surely do the job  a  British steak puff pastry slice  what is there not to like about it  especially when I further read you description where you state that  Made with tender British steak pieces in a rich gravy encased in golden  flaky puff pastry  wow I thought  it was like I d seen the light  a true moment of joy and if I m honest a little smile crept across my face and I could barely contain my excitement as I headed off to make my purchase.  I completed my purchase and hurried back to my car with great anticipation of the treat that I had in store  I gently and carefully unwrapped said treat and took my first bite  my word  wow  the golden puff pastry and the rich gravy was indeed delightful  I congratulated myself on making one of the best purchases of my life  I then took another bite and the same thought crossed my mind  however by the third mouthful I became somewhat deflated as that had the same taste and texture as the previous two  it was dawning on me that something was wrong  seriously wrong  where was my  tender British steak pieces  I thought  I continued mouthful by mouthful on my quest to find this tender British steak that you speak of then it happened  on my penultimate mouthful there it was  the holy grail that I had been searching for  it wasn t the biggest piece of steak that I had encountered in my 43 years on this earth but nether the less I had found it  it may have been the size of a pea but I couldn t deny here it was. However this was the only piece in the entire slice  you may now see the relevance of my earlier explanation regarding my education  as I was promised Tender British steak  pieces  the s indicating that there would be more than one and if I m honest I did make the assumption that it would be larger than a pea which I realise is my own fault and in no way hold you liable for  however as the product was not as described may I suggest you either add more of this elusive Tender British steak pieces you speak of or change your labelling by removing the s from pieces.;;;;;2016-10-07T12:05:17+0000;1475841917;2016-10-07 14:05:17;6;8;9;1;18;8;5;3;1;0;6;0;0;3;0;0;0

Indeed sourcing with integrity is one of your stated core values. I should say at this point that I am not and have never been an  activist . I am however a mother of 3 young children and am realistic enough to realise that farming and food production does ultimately require their slaughter. However I also firmly believe that farming should be a humane process and that animals should be kept in a natural environment. These are values that I had until very recently understood Sainsbury s shared  and for which reason I have in the past chosen to shop at Sainsbury s.   This week I learnt that Sainsbury s are supporting a gigantic industrial size ZERO grazing dairy  which is to be constructed at Crouchland s Farm in West Sussex. We all know that such a system is not natural and has nothing to do with animal welfare. I must advise that because of Sainsbury s support for such a system of dairy farming  I know longer feel able to continue shopping at Sainsbury s and will do my utmost to encourage my friends and like minded parents at my children s school to do the same.

When I arrived home and went through the collection what to take it reads as follows Your order no The payment card you used to place this order  If someone else is collecting on your behalf they must bring your order no  your billing address or your billing postcode  When I contacted  the store they still argued that If someone collected it they still would need a copy of the original email conformation.This I offered to give them on my phone in the store. It seems that the staff in the Dursley  store don t know the company procedure. I.now have my order which was collected by a member of my family with just my order no and postal code.

Today (6th October) I visited your store in Cheadle at around 1pm with my 4 month old identical twin girls. I was by myself and it was the first time I d been to a supermarket with them. The girls decided to have a meltdown while I was there! But an amazing employee of yours called Pam came to my rescue. She helped me finish my shop  arranged for a till to open  asked some other staff to load my items on the belt and pack it for me and then Pam walked me to the car  the whole time holding one of my babies so I could hold the other so they would stop crying. As a twin mum it s so hard popping anywhere and I could have hugged her for her kindness.

It s open until 10pm most nights  which is really useful. It stocks a good selection of fruit and vegetables  and  although you might not think a small shop would be much good for vegans  it actually is! I can find flour  dried fruit and nuts  some bread (not all is vegan  as it contains milk  and I wish it didn t  why does it?)  several types of crackers and crisps  tins of beans and other vegetables  tomato puree  pasta  rice  nut butters - even Meridian cashew nut and almond butters  wow! -preserves  some breakfast cereals (not those with honey added)  juices  smoothies  frozen potato products  soya milk  and even some non dairy chocolate to treat myself.  If I only had this small local shop for all my shopping needs  it would be fine. I could easily be vegan  just with this one store. People are always asking me  what do you eat?  I have to wonder if they can be serious. It s not a very sensible question. With all of this choice in just one small shop  and a recipe book or two   there is no problem at all.

Firstly  you have removed the forks that were previously included with no warning or note on the packaging  not helpful! What am I supposed to do  drink it?.... Secondly  it is not even edible!

This is very inconvenient for me as I m usually in a rush to do my shopping after work and having to queue at the deli counter for exactly the same prepacked cheese and meat seems a lot more inconvenient  especially as its displayed in a less easy to view way if people are stood infront of the counter.  Can you tell me whether this is a temporary move  and if not will you be making it more convenient for your shoppers? Or are we going to be required to point out the prepacked stuff what we want to your deli staff in future?

By 10.30am the store had still not called  so she called customer services and was put through to the store. The abrupt and unhelpful Delivery Manager said he knew nothing about it and hung up on my mum!

She spent time talking to this customer about how her week had been  her receipt as the customer had queries and general chit chat. At no point was this customer rushed or treated poorly.

It does say it will be free above 10 pounds which is not fair as I can buy several items and still don t reach the 10 pound mark. It should be free for any sainsbury s costumer  regardless of what we spend. Why would I pay for parking at this store  if I can drive a mile and be at Colliers Wood store for example  where I have a bigger store and free parking for costumers. It s cheaper to drive further than having to pay the parking fee at the Tooting Broadway store.  A very unhappy costumer that will not come back to this store.;;;;;2016-10-04T18:56:53+0000;1475607413;2016-10-04 20:56:53;1;6;1;0;7;6;3;3;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

I had confirmed to me by more than 1 staff member add her the incident that this in fact was Sainsburies ground the incident occured on.  My grandmother quite rightly has chosen to take this matter further  which my husband has been feeling with on her behalf. She s been through a traumatic ordeal and had to be rushed to hospital and is very lucky to be still with us.  She spilit her head open and required 4 stitches and her nose which was burst open that required 6 stitches . After several phone calls back and forth to the kirkintilloch branch and head office we have now been informed that the incident didnt occur on Sainsburies property after all.  I have on good authority however that after the incident took place Sainsburies were quick to repair the spot where my grandmother fell  had this not been their land which they claim  why did they feel obliged to repair it?! And further more have the bare faced audacity to offer a ¬£35 voucher as way of apology! My poor gran hasn t felt confident leaving the house since the incident occured and is now very unsteady on her feet as a result. This was a very active and fit lady in the past! This matter will be taken further and I will also be taking it to the local newspapers. I am.utterly disgusted in the way this has been dealt with!!!;;;;;2016-10-04T18:07:51+0000;1475604471;2016-10-04 20:07:51;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I was gutted that these contain soya too.   10 to 14% of people with milk allergy are also allergic to soya but you don t cater for them in your free from ranges. When it comes to dairy alternatives my local sainsburys aint great. I do most of my food shopping with you  then get cheese substitute and affordable coconut based yoghurts (the ones you sell are ridiculously expensive and not as nice) from another supermarket. I m probably gonna have to start doing my full shop there cos as loyal as I am to you that loyalty can only go so far.  Pointless rant I know cos you re not gonna change anything based on this post but at least I got it off my chest. I ll put my soapbox away now.;;;;;2016-10-03T18:57:02+0000;1475521022;2016-10-03 20:57:02;0;3;0;0;3;3;1;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

This is a complaint regarding your Newport (Albany Road) Store  more specifically the car park. You may or may not be familiar with its layout  but there is an area away from the store which has Wales and West Utilities gas apparatus along side. Separating the car park and the apparatus is a wooden panel fence (I have be informed by a store member that the fence is Sainsbury s responsibility)  which is frequently the target of vandalism. This fence is constantly being smashed and bits of timber are strewn around. Your facilities contractor comes out to repair it  and it is immediately subjected to more vandalism. On Sunday afternoon  I was walking to your store with my 5 year old daughter past this area of the car park and a nail which was still attached to the piece of wood  that at one time would have been holding a section of fence up went into my daughters foot  resulting in an afternoon spent in Royal Gwent Hospital A&E department. As you can imaging this caused my daughter a great deal of pain and distress  She is now in quite a bit of discomfort and unable to put all her weight down on it.    We would like to see this wooden fence taken down and replaced with a more secure metal fence  which may not be as prone to vandalism and hopefully prevent any injuries to your customers who cross that part of the car park to use your store. The injury to my daughter was entirely preventable  if you didn t put profit over customer safety. If you would like to discuss this matter please private message me and I will forward you my contact details. I look forward to your prompt response. Please be aware that I will be contacting the local press to bring it to the attention of other users of your store  should your response be less than satisfactory.;;;;;2016-10-03T18:21:17+0000;1475518877;2016-10-03 20:21:17;12;10;12;1;23;10;4;6;6;0;12;0;0;0;0;0;0

As a mother of one I shop at this branch four times a week. I was in the disabled toilets changing my two year old daughter s nappy when I heard someone try to open the door. When she realised that there was someone in there she then started to pull at the handle and kick the door and then started to scream the most disgusting expletives. She said amongst other things   get the f**k out . For f**k sake get out of there. C**ts. I shouted that I had a child and that she needed to moderate her language but it only continued. She then stopped and I waited until I could be sure she was away from the door. As you can imagine I was upset and shaken as I do not want my daughter being subjected to that and as you can imagine she was terrified.  I then came out of the toilets and went to the till nearest and asked if anyone had heard the shouting and the abuse. I was told that they had but hadn t realised that she was shouting at someone. I find it quite shocking that if you heard someone shouting expletives you wouldn t call security or get up to investigate what was going on. I was then told that she was a regular who was known to them and whose behaviour was known to them.  Prior to going to the toilets I had actually left my shopping with a member of staff. I went to that member of staff and told her what had happened and she said that she would go to the  security guard and look at the cctv. I paid for my goods as soon as I could as I wanted to leave. I then was told by the lady who had looked after my shopping that the next step was that the manager would be spoken to and that I would be called with an update as to what action would be taken.  I was then told to go to customer services and the service from the lady at the till was lovely as I explained what happened. She then mentioned to her colleague Brendan who I was and he said without speaking to me  I ve spoken to her I am with another customer.  He had spoken to me in passing and I found his lack of acknowledgment rude. I would also like to point out that I saw a member of staff in a striped shirt who I asked if he was a manager and he said yes and when I explained what happened he said he had just come on shift but yes I should leave my details.   When Brendan finally got to me. He told me that  my feedback would be taken on board and that I shouldn t have been told that I would get an update on the situation and my complaint as they would just speak to the customer. I thought this was disgusting. I was not giving feedback on an item or making a suggestion I was reporting an incident and I would imagine that would be taken seriously because as I said even when I expressed to this woman that I had a child her abuse continued. I would of thought with the number of Mums and families this would not be someone that you would want in the store.  My details were taken begrudgingly and I was wished a nice day and that was dripping with sarcasm. I hope that this incident will be dealt with properly and swiftly and the severity of the situation acknowledged when the appropriate action is decided. I also expect to be contacted as I will have to think very carefully about shopping at your south woodford store otherwise.  Thanks   Janine Danha.;;;;;2016-10-03T14:02:29+0000;1475503349;2016-10-03 16:02:29;1;3;1;1;5;3;2;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

A man walked into the store  looking for what he wanted and also trying to find his money - under a watchful eye from the staff.   This man looked like he was struggling with life at the minute  ragged clothing and unwashed in appearance. He told me he was homeless.   What disgusted me most was the bull-dog bully stance that your manager Jo Newhall had taken. She didn t even try to disguise the fact she was there to watch this gentleman  staring at him for his every move. She was emotionless  uncompromising and criminalised him from the start.   The complete lack of compassion and empathy for this man was abhorrent. Your manager completely de-humanised this human being  treating this man with absolutely no respect whatsoever after picking up a ¬£1.10 pack of chocolate shortbread.   This man left the store feeling utterly drained of what ever dignity he may have had left.  I undertand that your staff have a responsibilty for the security of the store  but it hurts me most especially when your staff  managers and Sainsbury s are the ones in a position to help  to witness the lack of humanity that your manager had today.   I hope to see more done to help those in need.;;;;;2016-10-03T09:54:18+0000;1475488458;2016-10-03 11:54:18;3;4;5;0;9;4;2;2;3;0;2;1;0;0;1;0;0

They offered my little girl a chocolate bar which calmed her down and helped calm me down.   You don t always see this kindness in the world and I would really like them to get some recognition after this good deed. They could have just sent me away but they didn t.

Laying off staff on the 30th of December is hardly the most humane thing to do  but given that this has become your closure deadline  at least do them the honour of not making them wear silly costumes over Christmas.  If your decision to close one of this town s most recognisable and necessary retail fixtures is profit-based  your calculations are at least a little off. Few people will be prepared to travel to Wolverhampton or Blackheath for the Sainsbury stores there. They will simply choose an alternative supermarket chain altogether.  What a great  great shame.

As we were heading over to the kiosk I know the staff member and joking said yea you better stand up I am coming for my fagsüòÇ To then be rudely told by a Manger called Graham that she can shout what she like as she is his boss bare in mind she was leaving the store off duty. For him to speak down to me as if I was a silly wee lassie. Telling me that I am offending customers no customers around at this time.telling me I am talking to loud.

I ordered online for the convenience  to save me dragging my two children around the shops with me.   I collected my order and when putting in the boot  I realised the majority of my meat was missing. Your staff member carried on with what he was doing although I had informed him that my meat was missing. After repeating myself a second time he shrugged his shoulders. I requested to speak with a manager and two normal colleagues were sent out to sort the situation. The meat was repicked and I left. I was there for over an hour!!  The meat that was picked  was put together with other items such as cooked meats and other items  half of my shopping unpacked although I requested bags. I think that your staff in store who pick this shopping need training in cross contamination.    The whole process was time consuming and very stressful  waiting in the car park for an hour.   Unpacking at home  I realise 17 items are missing from my shop. I ring up and speak with customer service and they tell me they will be in contact tomorrow and they cannot do anything until i have spoken with a manager. After calling back and insisting I have my items today as I needed them today hence why I arranged to collect today  I get them and I am told they were on the van all along.   Four hours after I collected my shop  two trips to the shop   and two phone calls later I have all my items. How stressful  absolutely never again.

I was even more disappointed when the lady on the cheeses raised my hopes and said they would be in at the end of November  and then said to her colleague   What is vegan?   The lady on customer services said that staff could not be expected to know what vegan meant if they didn t have anyone in their family who was vegan.  Then she said that they couldn t be expected to know about all religions (???).  Apparently  it s not part of staff training.  So  could you make this part of staff training?  And ..... would you let the staff at Sainsbury s in Eastleigh know about the range of  Free From  cheeses that you have just brought out.  You ll be glad to know that news of these are circulating fast on Facebook.  I m not a car driver  so would love to be able to find the cheeses in my Eastleigh store.  Thank you!  Oh  P.S.  Could you bring back the  free from mayonaise  too.  Sorry to see this has been discontinued.;;;;;2016-10-02T11:57:06+0000;1475409426;2016-10-02 13:57:06;1;3;1;0;4;3;1;2;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

This evening  a group of youths were causing a disturbance outside  two of which came cycling through your store and a third picked a fight with another customer who was asking them to stop and move on. The fight resulted in damage to some of your products and left staff members in a state of shock.  I have witnessed varied numbers of youths outside on my regular visits to this store and I am thankful that its taken until now for me to witness an act such as this. However  you have young staff in there  none of which are equipped to contend with activity such as this. To rely on a customer to step up is shocking as well as not surprising.   I do not care whether you may consider this local store to be of low risk to acts such as this  but your staff (and customers) very much need the added assurance of protection should this situation occur again  in fact I can promise that it will since nothing like that is unusual in our area.

I can no longer do what i class as a full shop at the store anymore and so its a sad farewell but farewell it is.;;;;;2016-10-01T15:26:37+0000;1475335597;2016-10-01 17:26:37;0;9;1;0;10;9;6;3;3;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0

Do you reduce the price if you don t have a roll because you re gluten free? Being gluten free isn t a lifestyle choice for most people  it s because of a medical condition.
