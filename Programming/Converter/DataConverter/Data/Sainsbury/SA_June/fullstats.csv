A few weeks ago I bought items that were definitely part of the meal deal and only after paying did I realise that no reduction had been made .  It was not much money so didn t make a point of going back to get a refund.  However having bought meal deals again 2 or 3 times since then I have made a point of checking that the deduction is made and have noticed that each time the full amount of the items is shown right up to choosing cash or card and only after going back one screen is the reduced amount shown (which I have then paid).  As I bought other items at the same time I am hoping Sainsbury s is not relying on people not noticing this anomaly.....???  This was not just within one store but across 2 or 3 different ones (in London).;;;;;2016-06-29T11:36:41+0000;1467200201;2016-06-29 13:36:41;0;14;0;0;14;14;2;12;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I ve worked in retail for many years and the whole shop was just a mess  it was like the shop hadn t been faced up in the last week so the look of the shop as well as the fact customers were on their hands and knees to get products from the back of the shelf!  I m not quite sure what the issue is as the stock is there but just nothing happening with it! Also when I went to the delicatessen there was two members of staff  one serving and the other one labeling olives  when I stood in front of the one labeling I wasn t acknowledged at all so I asked if she was serving and she then said if you can just wait a minute which I wouldn t have minded if I was acknowledged in the first place.   I have to say I m extremely disappointed in the entire store and the way things are  would appreciate your earliest reply.;;;;;2016-06-28T19:14:05+0000;1467141245;2016-06-28 21:14:05;1;13;1;0;14;12;4;8;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

This morning  I get a phone call from a Slough number. First of all  I am addressed as Mr  Rowan Britton - I am a Mrs. My account says I am female and so does the name on my bank card. Not impressed. After correcting her she didn t apologise. The woman says she s calling on behalf of Sainsbury s because the payment for my online delivery (expected at lunch time) hasn t gone through. While she s on the phone  I check my banking online - I have more than enough balance on my card. I tell her to try the card again. She does  it  doesn t work . She said she needs another card. I said I am not happy giving my card details out over the phone to a random company phoning me - she could be anyone! She huffs and puffs and reminds me that she is calling on behalf of Sainsbury s - I remind her that I don t know that. I can phone her and pretend to be whoever I want! I said if she already has the details I provided  she can try those but I am not happy giving any other details over the phone. Her attitude completely changes to really negative  and she then tells me I need to call my bank. My other direct debits have managed to leave the account with no issue  so I said there is no point. She then said  fine I ll cancel the order then!  And I said I suggest she does if that is the only option. She ended the call with  fine  bye!   If this is your customer service team  they need some retraining. I have never been spoken to so badly in my life. I understand that my card going through isn t her problem  but the attitude is her problem! I also don t think it is unreasonable to refuse giving a stranger my bank details over the phone. It wasn t even a Sainsbury s number she called from. I definitely will not be placing an online order via yourselves again.;;;;;2016-06-28T08:02:55+0000;1467100975;2016-06-28 10:02:55;0;2;1;0;3;2;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0

I bought a bouquet of flowers on Saturday for my fiancé as I do each week. The bouquet was £12 with a 5 day guarantee for the flowers. On Sunday morning the rose heads had dropped and petals falling off  the other flowers in the mixed bouquet had gone limp and discolored. So this morning I wrapped them back up and headed back to the store.  I went to the cashier to explain what had happened at was honest in I did not still have the receipt but had the transaction on my phone app  had no price on original wrapping as who leaves the price on a gift?  The cashier was very friendly and called for the supervisor were thugs started to go down hill. The lady who came over did not smile once but looked annoyed  after I ran through again what had happened asking me what I wanted I said just a refund would be great. she walked over to the flowers and came back saying there was no bar code can she just give me £10 instead of £12? She also asked me what the expiry was on the flowers. If they where due to expire on Saturday or Sunday they should not have been sold with a 5 day guarantee on them.

This was very disapointing. It was the only reason I went in there. I won t buy vegan wraps from Tesco as they contain palm oil  yours didn t. However tesco do do a few other vegan ranges in their sandwich chiller  that don t contain palm  so it looks like I will be buying my lunch from there in future. When the world is becoming more vegan friendly  or dairy free friendly  this is a step backwards. Tesco are doing a very wide range of other vegan products (some that don t contain palm). Nearly all of your vegan products contain palm  this is why I do the majority of my shopping at Tesco. Many other vegans will also not buy palm oil products  even if they are using sustainable palm  as it is well known now that the sustainable palm industry has been lying in many cases  and that the industry is in turnmoil. Please use the many other oils that are available. A vegan would rather pay more for their food knowing that the world  animals & people had not been killed to make it. They would also rather their bodies be healthier and palm is one of the fattiest oils...Thanks.;;;;;2016-06-26T12:41:20+0000;1466944880;2016-06-26 14:41:20;0;3;0;0;3;3;2;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

When we got to the bakery counter to pick the cakes 3 members of staff came out from behind the counter & started chatting in front of it making it very difficult to see.  When we had picked the cakes we wanted all of them walked away leaving me & my daughter stood at the unmanned counter. I stood and asked if they were seriously walking away when a customer was standing & they all just turned round & stared at me as if I was daft. I then walked away & 1 of the men found me in another aisle saying sorry he would serve me now. I explained that they had to be joking they blatantly stood in front of me when we were trying to pick out cakes then walked away as soon as we wanted served. He said he didn t realise I wanted served  surely the fact I was at the counter was enough of a clue that I wanted served.  I am not normally 1 to complain about things but I then had to explain to my daughter that we couldn t get the cake she wanted & it s also not the 1st time I ve had terrible service in this shop.;;;;;2016-06-24T19:47:56+0000;1466797676;2016-06-24 21:47:56;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

We ate the recalled product on Monday  by Tuesday morning I had all the symptoms of mild food poisoning and had to take the 2 days off work. My daughter had to stay home from school yesterday and again today. After wondering why we were both ill  last night I received the email to say that the  Tex mex dip selection  may contain salmonella! This made perfect sense to us as we were the only two in the family who ate the product!  Despite these facts Sainsbury have only agreed to refund the product and won t escalate my claim that the recalled product may have made us ill  as I do not still have the product to submit to testing. We are ill because we ate all the product therefore no I don t have the product to test if We hadn t eaten it all We probably wouldn t be ill!

After saying how rude the security was  was then followed out to be called a faggot  a cunt and told if return when he is there i will be banned. This was a gentleman of age with a moustache. As a manager myself working with customer everyday feel this is absolutely disgusting and will be boycotting this sainsbury and any other ensuring my whole company  family and friends do the same.

I had saved a couple of 50p off vouchers for PG Tips but when I presented them at the till the cashier noticed they had expired on 31/12/15. I assumed I must have bought the tea bags some time ago. I did however purchase a further 2 boxes yesterday evening and opened one when I got home. It had the exact expired voucher in it. I contacted Sainsbury Chester this evening and spoke to Cathy on the Customer Service desk. She was initially quite disinterested and suggested I contact PG tips. I suggested that maybe the problem lay with Sainsbury and their stock control. I didn t get the impression that Cathy was looking to provide resolution to my issue or in fact offer an acceptable level of customer service. I took a note of the telephone number offered and thanked her letting her know I would be sharing the detail on the Sainsbury s Facebook page in order that other customers were made aware. Her tune changed very quickly and a callback was offered. She returned to advise that the sell by date on these boxes were Oct and Nov 2017 and that they felt PG Tips had printed an incorrect valid to date on their vouchers. She passed me to her duty manager who said that their customer care team would be made aware and eventually took my name and told me I would be refunded the value of the coupons the next time I was in store. I am disappointed that no service at all was offered until I mentioned that I would be sharing the details on their Facebook page in order to make other customers aware of the problem with the coupons!;;;;;2016-06-21T18:39:03+0000;1466534343;2016-06-21 20:39:03;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am talking about 21 day aged rib eye steak available on the butchers counter.  It seems this was stopped being supplied a few weeks ago and someone somewhere has decided to replace it with Aberdeen Angus steak  which has no sticker to show how long it is aged.  It may be Aberdeen Angus  but I must admit that the steaks do not look particularly appetising  and from the colour of the meat it does not look like it is aged much at all.  Is this a policy decision nationwide not to supply 21 day aged steak  or has Pepper Hill been singled out for special treatment;;;;;2016-06-21T11:33:20+0000;1466508800;2016-06-21 13:33:20;1;6;1;0;7;6;2;4;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

Last week you took over £90 from my account and it was expenditure I was not expecting. Firstly you took £60 payment for the renewal of a delivery saver pass which I did not want . Surely you should have to opt in to such things. I asked for a refund of this 6 days ago but no reply on this has been received to date. Secondly you sent a pack of 200 cigarettes instead of a 100 pack. I complained about this but your team seem to have missed the point that surely a better option would be to have sent single packs. They want me to return the unwanted ones but I can t split the pack. I was left with the choice of no cigarettes or 200 and as I couldn t get out of the house at the time I was left with no choice! All on all  it s very poor service and you do not deserve my loyalty.;;;;;2016-06-21T11:02:03+0000;1466506923;2016-06-21 13:02:03;2;15;2;0;17;15;4;11;3;0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0

I d  tried everything possible with it but am now stuck with all the ingredients ready to make a cake but can t as the mixer doesn t  work - it just flashes blue lights at me (so is clearly getting power). I m supposed to be taking the cake to a tea party for the 3 learning disabled young people I work with this evening. I now won t be taking anything as there are no shops near me to even buy one from! Despite my quoting the model & serial number & your customer services admitting it is faulty it seems Sainsbury s are unwilling to exchange   refund or do anything for me without the receipt or some proof of purchase. Since the mixer is Sainsbury s own make I couldn t have bought it elsewhere. I have no idea when I bought it. I have frontal lobe atrophy so am very forgetful. I suspect I bought it shortly after my mum died  - April 2015 - as I made loads of cakes with it for the reception after the funeral. I have no idea what I did with the receipt and can t remember if I used my credit or bank card. Either way I have online banking for both and it d be pretty difficult to identify which transaction it was included on.  So . In conclusion I now have a useless piece of junk I paid about £150 for  a kitchen full of ingredients I have no option but to chuck away & this evening there will be some very disappointed young people. I should ve learned from a previous debacle when I bought a cooker   washing machine & dishwasher that Sainsbury s seemed at a loss to manage to deliver & even when they finally arrived were damaged. So it s 2 strikes & you re out. I m not buying a single thing from Sainsburys again nor will I be setting foot in one of your stores.;;;;;2016-06-20T15:24:54+0000;1466436294;2016-06-20 17:24:54;0;8;0;0;8;8;1;7;3;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

She was Extremely enlightening on a bright Sunday morning about personal shoppers in store who collect the online orders too!   I would also like to thank you for my shopping in which almost every item was individually bagged in a nice orange carrier bag except randomly the bread and baked beans - possibly not a brilliant combination to bag?

Not only did the customers who were also shopping  show nothing but love and no horrible looks  the staff went out of their way to help! A female worker of yours came over to us and tried to calm my nephew down by baby talk tactics  she then asked a male to stop doing what he was doing to open a till for me.

I was just enjoying some of your delicious fresh French Onion soup for luncheon  when I happened upon the list of ingredients at the back there. One of these ingredients  a sub-ingredient of the Balsamic vinegar  is  Grape Must Concentrate  (I m not making this up  can provide photo etc.). Can you explain why the grape needs to concentrate  and what the nutritional / taste benefits (or costs) are to me when it is concentrating vs when it is not concentrating? Under what other circumstances are grapes expected to concentrate  and are they known to be better at concentrating than other ingredients? At the risk of tarring them all with the one brush  can grapes even read? Is there a risk to the grape that overly long periods of concentration would lead to fatigue? Or does the person dictating the list of ingredients suffer from ADHD or similar  and was simply reiterating a mental note to themselves  which the typist took literally and wrote on the packaging? It s got me questioning the rights of grapes now - I d hate to think that the delicious grape that has given its life to my belly had to suffer unnecessarily in its last days.;;;;;2016-06-17T12:27:57+0000;1466166477;2016-06-17 14:27:57;7;7;8;0;15;5;3;2;8;0;6;0;0;1;0;0;0

Maybe just one checkout where the staff don t ask you anything other than  do you need a bag?  and then take your payment. Not everyone likes  or is good at  small talk. Not everyone wants to be asked how their day has been every time they shop  especially if it s been a horrible day. Myself and quite a few friends dread the small talk that seems to be standard these days in supermarkets. We know the staff  lovely as they are  do it because they ve been told to be friendly but for an introvert it s seriously uncomfortable.;;;;;2016-06-17T12:20:47+0000;1466166047;2016-06-17 14:20:47;1;15;1;0;16;15;7;8;17;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

My order was due to be delivered on Monday 13th June but due to unforeseen circumstances  I had to put the delivery off for a day.  Groceries aren t cheap  which is why I shop on a weekly basis with either Sainsbury s or Tesco s - so that I have minimal waste.   However  last night I started to prepare a spaghetti bolognaise for my family and two guests but when I looked at the mince  it was brown and so I checked the date on the packaging to find that it was out of date by a day and on checking the mushrooms  I could see that they were  in the main black and so I had to throw both away too.      Instead I took the carrots and new potatoes out of the fridge to rustle something else up... and found that these too were a day out of date by a day and wet to the touch and so in the end  I had to pay out for a takeaway for us all  whilst this weeks fresh food order was nearly all in the bin... what a waste!

Your new ones don t fit in the spice rack (and  I m assuming most spice racks are a fairly standard size so it s probably not just mine they don t fit) and you don t seem to do pilau rice seasoning.

No help always having to chase and still 4 months later not done. We are having more trouble than help from them its a joke.

We ve been here several times before and alway treated well - today  you re staff went above and beyond to make my friend smile! We had gone to Sainsburys not to do shopping - but to have a picture taken with a cardboard cut out of The Stig (we....I mean he  LOVES The Stig) as my friend has always wanted his picture taken with him. Well  when we get there we couldn t find The Stig anywhere.....a member of your staff called Jo said she would find it for us. She then spent half and hour searching for it through crates and crates of cardboard....when she found it not only did my friend get to give The Stig a hug but Jo let us take The Stig away!! I can not tell you just how much this meant to my friend! Your staff have made him so so so happy! Well done Jo an well done Sainsburys for having such amazing staff! Please ensure that ur sincerest appreciation are passed on to Jo! She definitely deserves some good recognition!;;;;;2016-06-15T20:26:28+0000;1466022388;2016-06-15 22:26:28;15;5;17;0;22;5;4;1;3;0;15;2;0;0;0;0;0

Of course this man isn t my real dad by blood  but this particular gentleman has been in my life for nearly 10 years  I m 24 this year  so just think  I was in school when I first met him  he s seen me move schools  to a completely different area of the U.K.  supported me when my mother wasn t there  bought me my first car  and treats me like I m his own daughter.   So what has saddened me today  is that I ve just spent 45 minutes looking through your selection of Father s Day cards  only to come out empty handed as you don t seem to stock anything related to a child/adult that doesn t live with their biological father  some children/people don t even know theirs. I m lucky that I know mine.   Yes  I know you stock generic  Happy Father s Day  cards  but I honestly don t think my stepdad deserves something generic  he deserves to receive a card that says  to my step dad  or  to the father figure in my life   a card that actually has a full meaning and means that I appreciate everything he does for me even though he genuinely doesn t have to.  Did you also know that everyday there are 1 300 step families forming  so I m not the only one in the world with a step parent. That s a very big number  so why have I found it so hard to find a card that tells that person how much I appreciate them and love them?   I also don t understand why you stock stepdad cards under your birthday range but not on Father s Day? Is that not a little backwards?   I suggest that instead of thinking that every family has a biological mother and father living under the roof  you think outside the box and cater to all types of families.

The ice cream was totally defrosted  almost to the point of being runny  but the driver argued with me - not a good plan! - and I sent it back. Apparently it was my own fault for asking for delivery without carrier bags! They had none of the perfectly normal  everyday milk I requested  and for the third time in a row  none of the dog treats I ordered. I did ring to complain  and the very nice man was apologetic and promised a refund and will recall the van as the refrigeration unit is obviously faulty etc etc.  To add to my annoyance they have sent me an evoucher for £13 that has to be used today! .

However today was disgraceful on Sainburys behalf. My wife and I went food shopping and when I went to pay with my debit card it declined twice so instead of trying a third time and blocking my card we resorted to using her card  which went through. Then when we got I went straight on my bank to check why it would have declined. Too find that both declined amounts had been deducted from my available balance. I then went back to the store to ask them to sort it out  to have them tell me they cannot do anything as they are having technical issue and that I will have to wait until the funds get returned to my bank in around 5 days or so... Which is ridiculous ! No offer of any compensation/vouchers for their mistake.;;;;;2016-06-13T19:00:14+0000;1465844414;2016-06-13 21:00:14;0;5;0;0;5;5;3;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I have just moved into the area and i do suffer with a few mental health problems so i am unable to leave the house some days. But after speaking to staff at my local store it was agreed i could come with my dog  wait outside  and your staff would do my shopping for me. I do not do weekly or monthly shops. I go everyday  around 7am when you open and buy 2-3 items. One of your staff  Jill  is outstanding  she actually comes outside the store to hold Bella so i can go in. After my comment last month you contacted the store and Jill has now been given a reward for showing  outstanding customer service  for going above & beyond to help a customer who has mental health problems.  But this morning things went bad. I got to the store as normal  Jill came out  took Bella and i went in  i got a bottle of Pepsi Max  some banana s and a pizza  then went to the kiosk to pay (no normal manned tills was open). There was a young girl with pink or red highlights leaning on a normal till doing nothing. But that was it.  I then waited at the kiosk for 6-7 mins while a person in front of me was doing a batch of lotto tickets  and this 6-7 mins the young girl with pink or red highlights was still doing nothing. Didn t even open a till for me like Andy  Cathy  Mike always do.She stood there doing nothing.  Then said girl walked over to the Kiosk  picked up the phone and phoned store management. On the phone she said  I feel like i should let you know. Jill is stood outside holding a dog doing no work at all.  As which point i walked over to her  i said  No  its my dog  Jill always does this for me  heck she has even been rewarded for it  to which i was blanked  and after the call she young girl just walked away.  This has left me feeling very angry. Why would she phone the store manager to snitch about a member of staff when she could of just asked Jill what she was doing? Why did she not open a normal till? Why did she totally blank me and walk off?  I used to work as a CTS at Sainsbury s  before being promoted to a night manager & i would NEVER expect one of my staff to of done that. it s important to trust the people you work with. How can Jill trust her when she is running to the manager instead of just asking Jill what she was doing?  I really do hope Jill does not get into trouble  and she gets to keep her reward. The store was Leeds Headingley.;;;;;2016-06-13T07:22:11+0000;1465802531;2016-06-13 09:22:11;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Lydia wanted a bag of  pick & mix   but when she opened the lid of a jelly sweet box she noticed many of the sweets had been half eaten  and she said she could see saliva on some of them. The same thing in some of the other boxes. I showed this to an assistant who went and got a manager. He came along with 2 other assistants. I pointed out that this was a health risk as the sweets would now be contaminated. I suggested that the boxes affected should be removed. After waffling on about doenuts (not sure why)  she told one of the men with him to get some gloves. Lydia and I walked off  but Lydia sneeked back to see what they would do. The man wearing gloves removed the half eaten sweets  but chucked back the whole ones!!!!

Tracy saw my distress and came over to ask if I needed any help I replied saying that I needed help with organisation and to not be so forgetful to which we both laughed I said I was desperate to get my son a batman outfit as he was going to cosplay tomorrow. Tracy offered to go and look in the back for the right size  she came out a few minutes later with a beaming smile on her face and the batman outfit. I was so happy and thanked her and almost skipped to the checkout. I told the check out lady how wonderful and helpful Tracy was and she told me that it was her birthday tomorrow.

There were no pink castle cakes on the shelf and no label either.

The driver did not even realise that I was a new customer.  What I will say is that the shopping was bang on time and the driver was lovely very friendly.  An asset to your company. I normally use Ocado who I find are more organised and informative sending substitutions etc via e mail and reminders that they are coming.  Very poor how there are no different coloured bags to mark which is frozen or chilled.  Not impressed.

However after looking through the products I m really disappointed. I ve got coeliac disease  and unfortunately like majority of people with Coeliac  cannot tolerate oats even if they are gluten free. The whole range of free from biscuits all have gluten free oat flour in them  apart from other brands such as Schar! And it s not just that  it s not very clear on the front of the packaging that they contain it or that the recipe has changed! Why has it changed? Is there a reason? Most people shopping in the free from section would presume that they all would be suitable at a glance just as they used to be. It s a shame as Ive always preferred to shop at sainsbury s for the quality of the products in free from especially your biscuits  but you ve followed suit with tesco. It looks like I ll have to find an alternative supermarket to get my bits for the family shop!;;;;;2016-06-09T17:37:54+0000;1465493874;2016-06-09 19:37:54;3;6;3;0;9;6;4;2;0;0;3;0;0;0;0;0;0

This is a colleague announcement. Would all staff note that the afternoon rumble is about to start.  Trouble was  I thought it said  The afternoon grumble is about to start . Suddenly I had visions of staff coming together to have a good old moan about their working conditions  about rude customers  and about the price of bread. So I asked the nice lady on the cooked meat counter  who thought the idea of a collective grumble was great  and she d pop it into the suggestion box as a customer request. Apparently a  rumble  is Sainsbury-speak for   Let s tidy the shelves.  Except it s probably not a suggestion... She also told me that a young lad on work experience thought it was a literal order  using street argot  and that he would have to go off and fight the permanent staff. Suddenly  shopping at Sainsbury s became a lot more interesting....;;;;;2016-06-08T17:23:20+0000;1465406600;2016-06-08 19:23:20;6;3;7;0;10;3;2;1;5;0;6;0;0;1;0;0;0

(In fact most car parks) Just had a woman get the last parent/child space in front of me at your Kirkcaldy store and get out with 3 children approx ages 6  9 and 13  kids get out no problem and all walk merrily into the store. Meanwhile I then have to park in a normal space  squeeze round to get the chassis out the boot and get my 5 month baby s car seat out (thankfully I d parked with a space on that side) However on returning to my car  there s a car beside us now. Again I squeeze round and start unloading my shopping. Fold down the chassis  get it into the boot carefully and then have to squeeze my baby boy  in his car seat  in through a small gap to get him in the car. Said woman and children come strolling back to their car  get in and drive off as I m still negotiating how to get a baby in a car seat in through this space without bashing both cars! Fair enough she has children and is allowed to park there as their policy is  1 or more children under the age of 12  but maybe your car parks should have baby spaces as well as child spaces. Not impressed today 😡;;;;;2016-06-08T15:41:07+0000;1465400467;2016-06-08 17:41:07;0;11;0;0;11;11;5;6;27;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The one in Nantwich has heavy-duty metal black bollards all over it. Yesterday  I was SLOWLY pulling out of my parking space  when another car came racing up from my left. I had to turn the wheel sharply to the right to avoid it...and VERY SLOWLY (my foot was still on the clutch) dinked the bollard. The bollard is designed to cause maximum car damage - it dented not only the door but (more expensively) the sill underneath as well. I have received quotations of around £700 + VAT to mend my car. I understand that these bollards are to stop people parking on pedestrian walkways  but can they not be made of heavy-duty rubber or some similarly  soft  material? Failing that  can they not be re-designed NOT to crunch up car sills? I ve been shopping at this store for years - but now I m going to Morrissons instead where they manage to survive without bollards.;;;;;2016-06-08T14:38:36+0000;1465396716;2016-06-08 16:38:36;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I drove to this store to by part of my monthly shopping  this is something I have done for a number of years. Silly me did not have a pound coin in my pocket for the trolly. No problem I thought I will go into the shop to exchange a five-pound note for pound coins. To my shock   and amazement I was told by the member of staff they could not do this. I explained that I wanted to do my shopping and I did have my shopping bags in my hand  still I was informed that this exchange could not take place. So your company is losing a custom  who for years felt he was a valued customer.

I took all the out of date tubes to the costumer service desk to inform them and give them the tubes to throw away/send back or whatever they do with them. I got a snotty response  which made me mad. I demanded to see the manager as I was angry that I could have put that in my baby s mouth... I was told they were busy.

Eventually I gave up with the app. I logged on to the sitr one last time where to my suprise my basket had appeared again  and even better it then accepted my card details.  I only persivered as i had already invested time selecting all the shopping to put in my basket.

Before I list my slight annoyance  I just want to state that it s great to see your dedication to the free from ranges in your stores (namely the Canley  coventry store which is my local store)   Anyway  My husband has been recently diagnosed with coeliacs  so I go to get gluten free sweet chilli sauce to accompany the stir fry dinner I m going to have and go to the  free from  aisle to find an unheard of brand specifically marked up as GF  £2.50 for 300g. I picked it up Anyway  thinking it was slightly expensive  but as there was only one option it made sense as it has to be processed completely separately to normal gluten containing sauces and thought it was fair enough. However I was curious and went to the  normal  condiments aisle to find the common blue dragon sweet chilli dipping sauce  £2 for 380g which is also marked as GF!   I feel like It s tactics like that which make life so much more difficult for people who go to the specific aisle in good faith  just to get ripped off and line the pockets of the shop and food makers. It makes coeliacs think they re restricted in options  where it isn t necessarily the case (albeit if they d researched they could find this out for themselves - I get that!) is there any way of saying what potential other options there are on a poster  or maybe stock a small selection of other available products which may be suitable too in the free from aisle?  Also   right beside the gluten free options on the next shelf is the cake/baking / flour / ingredients - full of gluten! Seems slightly wrong to place them next to another in my mind - just an observation. 🙈  Thanks again though  having some GF options at least  so close to home has made the diagnosis easier for my husband 😊👍🏼;;;;;2016-06-06T13:17:56+0000;1465219076;2016-06-06 15:17:56;1;6;1;0;7

No problem with this as I was still home to receive it  and I opened the door with a huge smile of relief at receiving todays lunch and dinner. My problem is of all the things delivered was merely the  junk  No milk  meat  sandwich fillers  cheese  frozen stuff or vegetables. I m to feed 7 people tonight on junk or bread and water. I ve no bill to indicate how much I ve been charged. I ve had wrong stuff delivered which are not cost effective (small pack wipes and wrong flavoured food)   and well yes I could live with all this ordinarily as it really doesn t make life hard just more expensive.. EXCEPT I am on a training course tonight  and now have no time to get out and get any food to feed the 7 of us between now and later. It s going to cost me a whole lot more money to get a takeaway in  and then I ve got to reorder almost my entire shopping list!  So whilst the initial offer of a voucher was nice It s actually going to cost me more than that in another delivery cost as well as the food I now have to buy tonight AND the school dinner I have to pay for tomorrow!;;;;;2016-06-06T12:23:12+0000;1465215792;2016-06-06 14:23:12;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

So Sainsbury keep up your excellent customer service and top class training of your staff. this was well worth my time and now i am one very happy customer.. thank you thank you thankyou;;;;;2016-06-06T12:10:55+0000;1465215055;2016-06-06 14:10:55;1;4;2;0;6;4;3;1;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;0

The Bracknell delivery manager came round to see and proposed £75 damages which I agreed.  Months later  no sign of the recompense. When will it arrive?  She brought the head of the driving crew round to assess whether my front garden was particularly dangerous.  He said it was fine.  I stressed that my main concern all along was to get some assurance that it would be safe in future to let Sainsburys drivers onto my property.  His answer was quite revealing  Most of my drivers have never driven anything larger than a car before so these things happen.   Most reassuring.  Getting them to even take my complaint seriously had been quite a fight.  Calls to helpdesk produced no action. I then had to go down to the store and spoke to an employee whose initial response was to tell me to claim it on my insurance.;;;;;2016-06-06T08:58:36+0000;1465203516;2016-06-06 10:58:36;1;3;1;0;4

Here are some:  You are not voting to leave the EEA or WTO  meaning all of the UK s trade and benefit agreements will remain unchanged should we leave  until such a time that the UK decides to renegotiate them for any reason.  You are not voting to leave NATO  meaning our security agreements remain unchanged. Should we receive an act of hostility from a non-NATO member  then NATO countries are obliged to come to our assistance. This does not change.  You are not voting to leave the UN  G8 or G20  meaning Britain will have the same voice on the world stage as it does today.  You are not voting to leave Europe!! The UK will still  geographically  be part of Europe. Non political organisations aligned to Europe will still extend membership to the UK (I.e. sports governing bodies  and so on).  You are not voting to stop recognising Interpol  Europol and neither are you voting for SIS / MI6 to stop dealing with other intelligence services in the fight against terrorism and global  organised crime.  You are not voting against being able to travel to Europe  contrary to the belief of some fools recently on TV. The UK has always maintained stricter border and passport controls than many EU members. This will not change. You will still use a passport to go on holiday and you will still be allowed entry to countries in Europe. You may even get chance to skip queues by using the non--EU queues at the airport (the only point so far that is my opinion  and not necessarily a fact).  The UK economy will benefit to the tune of £billions in the first year after we leave.  Medical and science research will not simply stop. The UK pays into the EU to then get money back in the form of funding. The UK will now be in control of this money and can choose to fund whatever UK based medical  science  art or other research it chooses.  Farming will not lose money because of EU funding being cut. The UK negotiated a rebate of some monies that the UK pays to the EU  in order to subsidise UK farmers. Instead of asking for our money back  we can give it straight to farmers. No change there.  You are not voting against human rights. The EU Convention on  and European Court of Human Rights are not part of the EU. Until parliament passes a new bill of rights for the UK  these will still apply  as will precedents already passed down to UK courts from Brussels.  You are not voting to kick anyone out of the UK or block access to anyone. Neither are you voting to stop recruiting valuable European workers into things like the NHS. Like my other point about passports for travel  the UK is already outside of the Schengen zone and so migrant workers must enter the UK with a valid passport before and after June 23rd. That will not change. British borders maintain full control of who comes and goes. Should someone have the skills to apply to work in the NHS  then they will still be permitted travel and given an opportunity to apply for a job. Worst case  points based assessment  like the US  Canada and Australia use  will come into effect. The UK is likely to negotiate freedom of labour movement though  in exchange for freedom of goods movement.  You are not voting to move jobs nor production out of the UK! The EU actually helped fund the move of Ford Transit production from the UK to Turkey... Yes  the EU helped give UK jobs to people in Turkey by giving Ford a loan of £80m with very generous terms!  What you are voting for is UK sovereignty. You are voting to stay in or leave a political union of leaders and representatives that you British people did not elect. You are voting against a commission of unelected  elite men that nobody at all voted for and yet they make decisions on our behalf. You are simply voting to bring sovereignty back to Westminster  and that is all. If you worry about that because you don t like the Conservative government  look at the reality. Their majority in parliament is very slim. They have been blocked on big decisions already. You are therefore not giving sovereignty to David Cameron  but to the UK House of elected representatives. Do not be fooled by the fear campaigns that are simply run by the wealthy  who need EU money to thrive! Think about the future  and your family s future.;;;;;2016-06-06T06:35:56+0000;1465194956;2016-06-06 08:35:56;0;2;0;0;2;2;2;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

My order which was due to arrive between 10-11am cannot be delivered today. I am offered a refund but have now got to replace a huge order as I have visitors arriving today with no time to do so.  I thought a firm as large and experienced as Sainsbury s would have contingency plans in place for sick drivers or broken down vans. I have had so many bad experiences with Sainsbury s - not one of my recent orders has arrived without substitutions (annoyingly these are typically more expensive - Waitrose charge you the lower price but Sainsbury s don t).  A few years ago I was contacted on Christmas Eve to be told despite having had the order for 4 weeks  my order could not be delivered as they could not cope with demand. On that occasion following discussion with customer service someone arrived at my door with most of the order in bags from all of our local shops - an attempt to think outside the box which was appreciated despite the shambolic  poor business planning that led to it happening.  Today I was told a simple  No - we can t fulfil your order!  I will never use Sainsbury s again - Ocado  Waitrose and Morrisons manage to get their business model and professional service spot on every time. I was foolish on this occasion to be lured away from them by a good slot on Sunday morning but now regret it and will never make that mistake again.;;;;;2016-06-05T10:47:37+0000;1465123657;2016-06-05 12:47:37;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I understandably said   ow that hurt  and looked at her walking away. She made eye.contact and instead of a polite  sorry  she tutted  and carried on walking .

He said he had recently been in hospital and acknowledged that he shouldnt have been driving. He got out to check the damage to my car and i shouted to him that the car was still rolling towards me.I didnt think at the time but i should have taken down his reg no. and contacted dvla with concerns as to whether he was fit to drive. I contacted the branch to be told the cctv only covers the front of the shop by the cashpoint and as it took place near the exit  they couldnt do anything. I just hope he got home safely.

What a waste of time.;;;;;2016-06-03T20:48:17+0000;1464986897;2016-06-03 22:48:17;0;1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I normally book my delivery slot a few days prior and add 4 x casio calculators to my basket in order to check out at the £40 minimum and then log-in the evening before my delivery to buy my groceries online when I remove the calculators from my basket. Obviously I do not need four calculators as per order number 38209598 so please cancel this order for me.

This was ordered for my mother s 82nd birthday and reading various websites / forums it seems you have been unable to  provide availability  and no doubt boost your on-line sales in various areas of the country when people are unwilling to turn back the remaining items. As someone in their infinite wisdom decided to stop  click and collect  from our local store Helston - she paid a delivery fee as well. What a farce sending a van with a packet of toilet tissue  paper towel and washing powder - why not call or email and explain the alcohol was not available and did we want to cancel the order.

I love to snack on celery having stopped smoking some time ago  but the present crop is awful! Very green and bitter to taste  not at all the way celery should taste  with a nutty sweet taste & creamy white colour. I believe it s because the growers have to produce so much very quickly  and do not  Blanche  the plants ie stack earth or straw around the plant to prevent photosynthesis and make the stalks white. I remember as a child this process was done with treated soot from chimneys and celery really had to be washed. No doubt the influx of central heating and some weird EU regulation make this process illegal.

Anyway thought it was good offer - signed up as newby  added the 6 bottles of prosecco then added double the normal amount of toilet rolls and bleach to get the order to the £100!! Processed the order no problem.   Day before the delivery decided to add something on - problem wouldnt let me check out again so called your customer services -  oh yes if its the prosecco it was a mistake you cant actually have both offers so you couldnt have the 25% off the £7.50 bottlles!!! Hmmm ok well it let me the first time!   No the driver would have told you when he turned up!!  Why dont you try a different prosecco on the 25% off offer?    - Ok so i picked another one and to make the order up to the 100 again as it was less i ordered 12 bottles this time (Im not an alcoholic summers coming!)  Ok she said  the only thing is im not sure the £20 off new customer offer applies if the order includes alcohol!!!!   Really?? Anyway couldnt find anywhere in the small print it didnt so we went ahead and processed the order this time without problem but with a different prosecco! So tonight the delivery turns up -   Oh theres a change on there he says  -  You ordered 12 x bottles - they only sent 2 (obviously back to the full price as 25% off only applies to 6)  - there were no alternatives so none of the wine on the 25% off was available then?

I was so angry about the  con  that when the delivery van arrived this morning I refused to take delivery of the order  believing I would be charged the higher price.  In view of what some people have said I am wondering if I should have checked the receipt to see what price had actually been charged.

Just honour your offer!!!;;;;;2016-06-01T18:05:45+0000;1464804345;2016-06-01 20:05:45;0;7;0;0;7;7;2;5;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

This was previously a gluten and dairy free snack that my son eats every single day. Not only does he have bowel disease restricting what he can eat but he has problems controlling his blood sugars. The flapjack is literally part of his treatment plan to provide slow release oat carbohydrates. You have decided to rebrand it as  all butter  now containing milk and so my son cannot eat this  I m really disappointed and thought it was a fantastic product that did not need milk adding.;;;;;2016-06-01T16:10:41+0000;1464797441;2016-06-01 18:10:41;0;6;0;0;6;6;3;3;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

I am ex services and maybe one day join the police force so therefore i am not the type to nick stuff i have MONEY.

I order in time and one the day I get the below message:  We wanted to let you know that unfortunately due to unprecedented demand the Taste The Difference Prosecco you ordered is no longer available on the promotion price of £7.50. This means you will be charged the full price of £10 minus any discount that might apply  for example buy 6 bottles of wine and save 25%. So that you don t lose out we would still like to honour the offer  we have therefore added the price difference as an e-voucher to your account which you can use next time you shop online.  Can you tell me why I can t have the offer bearing in mind you have a supply of the the wine? Is this just to get people to do another order to your multi million pound business?
