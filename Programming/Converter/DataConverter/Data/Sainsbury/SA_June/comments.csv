We have recently re-launched our herbs and spices range and still have two products in the range which are Fairtrade. These are: JS fairtrade ground black pepper 43g and JS fairtrade whole black peppercorns 45g. Previously we had other Fairtrade products in the range. Unfortunately these had proven difficult to source to a consistent quality and quantity which is the reason we have decided to review the Fairtrade products in the range. We are committed to source fairly traded products wherever we are able to do so; when we are able to meet our customer’s requirements regarding quality and availability. Thanks, Naomi.";2016-07-04T12:01:49+0000;0

Yet I have been charged 80p per loaf. So £1.60 in total.  Why would you substitute this?

I said I am not happy giving my card details out over the phone to a random company phoning me - she could be anyone!

I said if she already has the details I provided  she can try those but I am not happy giving any other details over the phone.

She then said  fine I ll cancel the order then!  And I said I suggest she does if that is the only option. She ended the call with  fine  bye!   If this is your customer service team  they need some retraining. I have never been spoken to so badly in my life.

I bought a bouquet of flowers on Saturday for my fiancé as I do each week. The bouquet was £12 with a 5 day guarantee for the flowers. On Sunday morning the rose heads had dropped and petals falling off  the other flowers in the mixed bouquet had gone limp and discolored. So this morning I wrapped them back up and headed back to the store.  I went to the cashier to explain what had happened at was honest in I did not still have the receipt but had the transaction on my phone app  had no price on original wrapping as who leaves the price on a gift?  The cashier was very friendly and called for the supervisor were thugs started to go down hill. The lady who came over did not smile once but looked annoyed  after I ran through again what had happened asking me what I wanted I said just a refund would be great. she walked over to the flowers and came back saying there was no bar code can she just give me £10 instead of £12? She also asked me what the expiry was on the flowers. If they where due to expire on Saturday or Sunday they should not have been sold with a 5 day guarantee on them.  She finally came over with items to make up £12  but not once in the interaction of customer service did she smile  apologies or make any effort to be civil.   The cashier though was lovely;2016-06-27T11:04:43+0000;10154959433054377_10154959461089377;pageowner;0;Hi James, sorry you've had this experience. I'd like to get this fed back to the store for you. Firstly, this was Victoria coach station in London? Also, did you happen to get the name of the supervisor? Or could you PM me a description so we can identify her? Thanks.

Yes, we don't permit the use of these apps in our stores. Unfortunately our scanners don’t work with Nectar cards in this format so customers are not able to use these in stores. Our colleagues aren't able to handle a customers phone, or attempt to type in the Nectar card number from the phone into the till. Customers need to present their actual card or have their receipt validated to add the points the next time they're in store. Hope this helps. Maria;2016-06-26T16:54:21+0000;0

Customers are able to redeem points in all our stores. To do this at the checkout, you must have shopped in that store within the last 12 months. If you haven't, our store colleagues are able to perform a Nectar workaround. This involves one of our colleagues calling the Nectar helpline during their opening hours and then passing the phone to you to confirm some security questions. Which store did you shop in?

Myself & my 3 year old daughter were in around 6:30pm tonight & I told her she could pick us all cakes as a treat. When we got to the bakery counter to pick the cakes 3 members of staff came out from behind the counter & started chatting in front of it making it very difficult to see.  When we had picked the cakes we wanted all of them walked away leaving me & my daughter stood at the unmanned counter. I stood and asked if they were seriously walking away when a customer was standing & they all just turned round & stared at me as if I was daft. I then walked away & 1 of the men found me in another aisle saying sorry he would serve me now. I explained that they had to be joking they blatantly stood in front of me when we were trying to pick out cakes then walked away as soon as we wanted served. He said he didn t realise I wanted served  surely the fact I was at the counter was enough of a clue that I wanted served.  I am not normally 1 to complain about things but I then had to explain to my daughter that we couldn t get the cake she wanted & it s also not the 1st time I ve had terrible service in this shop.;2016-06-24T19:47:56+0000;10154951421234377_10154951458849377;pageowner;0;Sorry you had such a poor experience Suzanne.

I explained to the lady in store and on the phone I didn't know the brand name, I had looked at the list of products and didn't recognise it there so asked to see what cigar types they sold as I would recognise the packet. They all were adamant it was against the law and the lady at the til and her colleague on customer services and also the phone  were all flippant and condescending.

I've checked into this and the product is labelled as unsuitable for baking, and that may explain why it hasn't worked as the baking process may affect the food colouring. I'd recommend this more for colouring icing or filling. If you send me your Nectar card number in a PM, I'll pop on a refund for you. Ryan.;2016-06-24T07:59:59+0000;0

I don't normally shop at Sainsburys as I have a Tesco and Asda closer. I happened to be near so thought I would buy all my baking supplies from Sainsburys for a change. I have never in all the years that I have been a baker found a food dye in the baking isle that isn't suitable for baking. That makes no sense whatsoever. It is misleading and I did not look at the back of the bottle. Why would anyone when this isn't a normal occurance with food dye. I am not bothered for a refund as it seems I should always read the labels on your products. I will ask that this product and any others like it are moved away from the baking isle so others aren't confused. Food colouring should colour the food not turn it white. I am very disappointed and will stick to purchasing my baking supplies elsewhere. Thanks for your time;2016-06-24T08:08:27+0000;0

Unfortunately, without a sample to test we cannot confirm if this is what caused your illness. Symptoms of food poisoning can take up to ten days to develop and can be caused by anything you've eaten during that time. We appreciate all customer feedback and have logged your comments with the relevant team for review. I hope you and your daughter feel better. Sam.;2016-06-23T13:28:10+0000;0

I suggested you got more first aiders  you agreed!  On Friday  70th birthday  she went to collect preordered sandwiches from the north cheam store  she slipped badly on the soaking wet foyer floor. Once again it took a first aider 20 minutes to come as he was in a tunnel with no reception!!! I honesty think this unacceptable  my poor mum struggled her birthday party and all this week in agony  too stubborn to go to hospital but it s got to much for her and is going up there now.  I might aid also there was not caution wet floor signs up nor the rubber mats  but a remember of staff put them up after we left the store. Please get more first aiders!! You may live to regret it one day!!;2016-06-23T12:14:34+0000;10154946244039377_10154946265099377;pageowner;0;I'm very sorry about this Kelly. This is a concern if the first aider was not contactable.

Regardless, Sainsbury's policy is to donate at the managers discretion if you have a letter from a registered charity which I did. It's a garden party for 10-15 young people. So tight to refuse to donate a small amount of cake that's being thrown into bin bags in front of customers. Why didn't the manager just reduce them when I offered to pay for them? I find your response dismissive.;2016-06-23T08:32:45+0000;11

We do our best to cut down on food waste as much as possible as part of our commitments to reducing food waste in the UK. You can read more about this here: http://bit.ly/1zKA7qL.

I would like an explanation as to why the food was being thrown into plastic bags in front of customers & staff stated that it was being thrown away, why the store manager told me that donations had to be pre-approved by head office, yet you confirmed that it's at the managers discretion. You've also confirmed on social media (please see Twitter) that it's not acceptable to be throwing food into plastic bags during opening hours, yet not apologised or offered any kind of explanation or good will gesture. This is appalling behaviour and your response to all of this is even more shocking. I would like to make an official complaint as although this is travelling across social media fast, you don't seem to be paying attention or taking it very seriously.;2016-06-24T09:28:11+0000;2

The charity that I work for has homes allover London. The home that I work in is in Camden. The Vauxhall store is my local branch, although I haven't shopped there since. I would prefer to speak to someone in head office & for this to be taken seriously please. Thank you for your kind offer of ongoing support for the charity. The issue isn't just about how the store dealt with this situation but about how you as a company dealt with it. I would like to know what you as a company can do.

I'd like to speak to someone from head office & for them to explain what happened in store - why one of your supervisors/managers chose to throw perfectly good food into bin bags instead of donating to a charity, why he was so unhelpful and told me that it must be pre-arranged with head office yet you're stating that it's arranged at a store level. But when I went into store I was turned away quite rudely. I'd also like to know why your customer service on social media has been so dismissive & contradictory.

I've had various different people reply on Facebook & Twitter over the course of 3 days & not one has offered a proper apology or a solution. I've been told publicly that donations must be pre-approved & then told that they are at the store managers discretion. I've been told that someone would look into this for  me, then told that it will be looked into internally. You are taking no responsibility and pushing it all onto the store manager by telling me just to go in & speak to him. Now I'm being asked for my number for the store manager to call me, despite telling you that I found him rude. Despite telling you that I find your social media responses rude & dismissive.

I received a phone call from the manager of the Camden Store asking me about an incident that happened in his store. The incident happened in Vauxhall as I've stated many times. It's getting a bit ridiculous now. Why did you offer for a member of the executive team to contact me & then when I gave my number told me that they are unwilling to take my complaint? Let me guess... You'll look into this for me & my patience is appreciated. Sainsbury's social media team you are embarrassing yourselves.;2016-07-05T19:09:41+0000;7

I am amazed that Sainsbury s makes no provision for such situations Rival Supermarket chains seem to have no such problem.;2016-06-22T08:22:47+0000;10154942476244377_10154942493149377;3c65b068cd9eb73daa72a68f22fcf0b8a072ab03;0;He exhanged for a different model Cheryl on the advice of the call centre after they informed him of the fault being common in that particular model.

I had saved a couple of 50p off vouchers for PG Tips but when I presented them at the till the cashier noticed they had expired on 31/12/15. I assumed I must have bought the tea bags some time ago. I did however purchase a further 2 boxes yesterday evening and opened one when I got home. It had the exact expired voucher in it. I contacted Sainsbury Chester this evening and spoke to Cathy on the Customer Service desk. She was initially quite disinterested and suggested I contact PG tips. I suggested that maybe the problem lay with Sainsbury and their stock control. I didn t get the impression that Cathy was looking to provide resolution to my issue or in fact offer an acceptable level of customer service. I took a note of the telephone number offered and thanked her letting her know I would be sharing the detail on the Sainsbury s Facebook page in order that other customers were made aware. Her tune changed very quickly and a callback was offered. She returned to advise that the sell by date on these boxes were Oct and Nov 2017 and that they felt PG Tips had printed an incorrect valid to date on their vouchers. She passed me to her duty manager who said that their customer care team would be made aware and eventually took my name and told me I would be refunded the value of the coupons the next time I was in store.

As per my post it was the Hatchwarren store in basingstoke. Nothing more to add really apart from how much of a shame our experiences have been over the past few months. It's apparent that you have invested money there to improve the counters and some of the seating area but it seems that when the old seats were thrown out so was the good parts of the cafe like the service, choices, care and pride in giving the customer a good experience;2016-06-21T14:57:28+0000;0

You can see from the other posts that it is an ongoing and systemic issue rather than an isolated incident. I must say this conversation is a little baffling - surely sainsburys should be worried about the whole thing rather than what time I went in today - today was just a culmination of a number of months frustrations felt by myself (and others it seems....);2016-06-21T18:17:41+0000;0

I am talking about 21 day aged rib eye steak available on the butchers counter.  It seems this was stopped being supplied a few weeks ago and someone somewhere has decided to replace it with Aberdeen Angus steak  which has no sticker to show how long it is aged.  It may be Aberdeen Angus  but I must admit that the steaks do not look particularly appetising  and from the colour of the meat it does not look like it is aged much at all.  Is this a policy decision nationwide not to supply 21 day aged steak  or has Pepper Hill been singled out for special treatment;2016-06-21T11:33:20+0000;10154939746129377_10154940302944377;feba0772180c2446e68ecf1c33dc2420a6575740;1;Cheers mate, will give them a go.;2016-06-21T15:25:14+0000;0

I d  tried everything possible with it but am now stuck with all the ingredients ready to make a cake but can t as the mixer doesn t  work - it just flashes blue lights at me (so is clearly getting power). I m supposed to be taking the cake to a tea party for the 3 learning disabled young people I work with this evening. I now won t be taking anything as there are no shops near me to even buy one from! Despite my quoting the model & serial number & your customer services admitting it is faulty it seems Sainsbury s are unwilling to exchange   refund or do anything for me without the receipt or some proof of purchase. Since the mixer is Sainsbury s own make I couldn t have bought it elsewhere. I have no idea when I bought it. I have frontal lobe atrophy so am very forgetful. I suspect I bought it shortly after my mum died  - April 2015 - as I made loads of cakes with it for the reception after the funeral. I have no idea what I did with the receipt and can t remember if I used my credit or bank card. Either way I have online banking for both and it d be pretty difficult to identify which transaction it was included on.  So . In conclusion I now have a useless piece of junk I paid about £150 for  a kitchen full of ingredients I have no option but to chuck away & this evening there will be some very disappointed young people. I should ve learned from a previous debacle when I bought a cooker   washing machine & dishwasher that Sainsbury s seemed at a loss to manage to deliver & even when they finally arrived were damaged.

Unfortunately, as my colleague at the careline mentioned, exchanges without proof of purchase and over a year after purchase are at the store's discretion. I understand this is frustrating, however you can certainly pop back into your nearest store to see if there's anything they can do for you. Leigh;2016-06-20T16:37:37+0000;0

Thank you for your civilised reply. I would've bought it with other shopping so it won't show as a single item even if I can find it on my bank or credit card statement . Customer services said as it is the premium Kitchen Collection range - it's a big heavy beast - it has 2 yr warranty. I normally staple receipt to the instruction book as I have a brain injury so forget where I put things  but for some reason I haven't or it's got separated . I do remember using it to make lots of cakes for after mum's funeral so it's possible I bought it around then which would've been within the 2 yr warranty period .;2016-06-20T16:48:36+0000;0

If I have to go back to Waitrose for one or two important items, I might as well do all my shopping there!;2016-06-20T13:52:31+0000;0

We would have understood  but the cafe was only 60% full at a very generous push! We should have learnt from our last visit when we ended up waiting almost 45 mins in a very quiet cafe  but we thought we d try again as it s convenient with two children and the central location. We are now sat in a Tesco cafe with full bellies after being served food almost immediately! Socks most definitely need to be pulled up Plymouth  lets hope you received some for Father s Day;2016-06-19T11:30:51+0000;10154933517529377_10154933794769377;pageowner;0;Oh dear Dawn, that is a long wait!

Booked for 8:30-9:30 and arrived at 8:35.   The lady driver was extremely informative about her job status  apparently she feels she is treated like crap and as for my shopping  well she declared that she goes to ASDA as sainsburys are no good! She was Extremely enlightening on a bright Sunday morning about personal shoppers in store who collect the online orders too!   I would also like to thank you for my shopping in which almost every item was individually bagged in a nice orange carrier bag except randomly the bread and baked beans - possibly not a brilliant combination to bag?   Several short dates too within my shopping so given the packaging  short dates and overload of information from the driver  not sure I will be using Sainsburys again. Not really much customer care there 😔;2016-06-19T09:31:51+0000;10154933304254377_10154933727799377;pageowner;0;Hi Sarah, I'm really sorry about your experience.

They went above and beyond for a stranger in need and this was remarkable.  Regards  Danielle;2016-06-18T20:20:03+0000;10154931546249377_10154931556679377;pageowner;0;How fantastic Danielle.

I couldn t quite remember his name ... Adnan or Abdan or something similar. He was on the Customer Service desk both times. He was very helpful when I bought an electrical item on Wednesday evening and he checked availability on an item for me today and then went and fetched some for me. He was very polite and friendly and I like to give praise when it s well deserved :) Please pass on my thanks :);2016-06-18T19:31:57+0000;10154931429599377_10154931450964377;pageowner;0;Thanks so much for taking the time to send this feedback.

A decent amount of chicken in a mildly creamy sauce.  Devoid of any aromats/spice/seasoning  and about as Thai tasting as a Yorkshire Pudding. More like chunky chicken soup with a side of rice.

I welcome your comments on this.;2016-06-17T22:37:53+0000;10154928719209377_10154940211259377;pageowner;1;I can see my colleague Saira advised, the single pot for 55p contains 100g, however the 4 packs for £2.50 are 180g each.

This needs checking again and putting right, you are overcharging customers for the 4 pack Muller Rice. I am prepared to take this further.;2016-06-21T16:05:50+0000;0

My nephew(1yr 9mnth) had the biggest hissy fit after he spotted his favourite yoghurts go into the trolley! Oh my what a tantrum it was! Not only did the customers who were also shopping  show nothing but love and no horrible looks  the staff went out of their way to help!

She couldn t find any sandwiches at all that had no mayo.  As she also dislikes cheese  that makes it even more difficult!  In the end we had to forgo sandwiches and buy something different.;2016-06-17T17:30:06+0000;10154927904204377_10154927995259377;74547ed4faee76770e4cf631617bbd3276ed0648;0;Thanks, Ryan.

A best before date is a guideline for a reason! I'm sure we're all guilty of pushing it a few days or even a week but a full year is pretty rancid by anyone's standards? How was it not picked up on? Surely you have some sort of stock take/rotation or even someone thinking to double check these things when they're marking them down? It's a massive error had this have been a child's product it could have been a horrendous incident that could have even ended in a hospital treatment?  I'm not trying to start an argument with anyone but how can something a year out of date still be allowed on sale?!  Very worrying!;2016-06-17T22:46:05+0000;5

I was just enjoying some of your delicious fresh French Onion soup for luncheon  when I happened upon the list of ingredients at the back there.

Under what other circumstances are grapes expected to concentrate  and are they known to be better at concentrating than other ingredients?

After all, we need to ensure each grape has a University education in order to fulfill its abilities as a tasty, nutritious fruit. We would be doing a disservice to grapes everywhere if we didn't encourage them to concentrate their utmost in order to live up to society's expectations of them. Daryl.;2016-06-17T12:33:14+0000;4

Those under-achieving grapes we use for the French Onion soup is part of a program to ensure each grape reaches its full potential, regardless of educational background. In this way, we can ensure a fairer grape society and work towards grape utopia in the future. If the cost of helping our grapes achieve maximum flavour is passed on to the customer, we would consider it a civic duty of sorts; a way we can all come together and do our bit for the grape world as whole. I'll have your thoughts fed back to the Head of Grapes for future revision. We appreciate your concern for grapes the world over. Daryl.";2016-06-17T13:08:07+0000;3

Having thoroughly researched the issue, I notice that only the grapes in your soup (and balsamic vinegar) are expected to concentrate; grapes destined for other dishes are afforded freedom of thought, or indeed, permission to doze, while still becoming tasty and nutritious. From this we can ascertain that Sainsbury's is deliberately sourcing under-performing grapes for its soups (and balsamic vinegar), and is then having to fund their education in order to bring them up to par with your other grapes. This undue cost is being passed onto the loyal customer. I put it to you, that if Sainsbury's took the time to allow its better grapes into the soup (and balsamic vinegar), that customers would be able to pay the same price for the fresh French Onion soup as they can currently enjoy with the fresh (grapeless) Carrot and Coriander soup, which is 45p cheaper. Please pass this message onto your head of Grapes, thanking you kindly.";2016-06-17T12:56:08+0000;0

Maybe just one checkout where the staff don t ask you anything other than  do you need a bag?  and then take your payment. Not everyone likes  or is good at  small talk.

The taxi driver himself didn t even have the job booked until 5 minutes before he came to get me. I am 5 months pregnant and with a vulnerable adult doing their shopping. Absolutely shocking service and very rude! This has been logged with @sainsburys #sainsburys head office in London and an official complaint made as this was booked through the the in store  taxi call point  sainsburys are essentially advertising this company. Just got back and the driver took a wrong turn and then did a u turn in the middle of London road to on coming traffic  also then watched me and person I am supporting struggle with heavy shopping bags once at the address...even after I told him I am pregnant and need help with them. Let s hope that something gets sorted because it s terrible and left me feeling very upset and the taxi office clearly don t want to know.;2016-06-17T12:05:22+0000;10154927061724377_10154927113019377;pageowner;0;Hi there Bex, I'm very sorry about your experience.

No help always having to chase and still 4 months later not done. We are having more trouble than help from them its a joke.

The fuel market is extremely competitive and prices are very volatile in the current climate.  Prices differ throughout the UK and you will see varying prices even between outlets owned by the same company. We want to ensure our petrol stations remain competitive within their local area, offering customers a fair price wherever they live. We therefore adjust the price at each station using locally gathered pricing information. We also run regular promotions on fuel including bonus Nectar points and money off per litre when spending a qualifying amount in our stores. Thanks, Naomi.;2016-06-16T15:14:32+0000;1

I am not willing to talk to 'customer service' or 'resolution team' anymore, if we could join together and complain to Financial Standard Authority (FSA) and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) then it will stop them fooling and distressing people. I am certainly taking the legal route as my pet is suffering for 2 months now from life threatening disease and they are still 'deciding' wether to preauthorise her diagnosis....my pet has no history of illness and they are deliberately doing this to put us off. Worst pet insurance I have ever had, wish I stayed with Tesco. I am also involving media and BBC Watchdog to expose their real face.;2016-07-31T14:37:13+0000;0

We're committed to offering great quality food at fair prices which is sourced with integrity. We regularly review our prices to make sure we offer value for money whilst remaining competitive and we work hard to negotiate great deals with our suppliers. Although we try to keep our pricing as fair as possible sometimes prices can go up as well as down. There are lots of factors which can affect pricing, from rising costs of raw materials, to the production and packaging and even transportation. Whilst we try to absorb these increases for as long as possible, sometimes we eventually have to put the price up. Thanks, Naomi.;2016-06-15T10:34:26+0000;0

To DOUBLE the price of a product which is one of the bargain items many people count on is, as I said before, irresponsible. Please can you ensure that my feedback on this matter reaches the highest level of management within the company.  I am not trying to be dramatic but there are families out there who have to budget to the pence and a £0.10 increase here and there can perhaps be absorbed but to double the price will make a significant dent into their budget.;2016-06-15T11:57:26+0000;0

I have just moved into the area and i do suffer with a few mental health problems so i am unable to leave the house some days. But after speaking to staff at my local store it was agreed i could come with my dog  wait outside  and your staff would do my shopping for me. I do not do weekly or monthly shops. I go everyday  around 7am when you open and buy 2-3 items. One of your staff  Jill  is outstanding  she actually comes outside the store to hold Bella so i can go in. After my comment last month you contacted the store and Jill has now been given a reward for showing  outstanding customer service  for going above & beyond to help a customer who has mental health problems.  But this morning things went bad. I got to the store as normal  Jill came out  took Bella and i went in  i got a bottle of Pepsi Max  some banana s and a pizza  then went to the kiosk to pay (no normal manned tills was open). There was a young girl with pink or red highlights leaning on a normal till doing nothing. But that was it.  I then waited at the kiosk for 6-7 mins while a person in front of me was doing a batch of lotto tickets  and this 6-7 mins the young girl with pink or red highlights was still doing nothing. Didn t even open a till for me like Andy  Cathy  Mike always do.She stood there doing nothing.  Then said girl walked over to the Kiosk  picked up the phone and phoned store management. On the phone she said  I feel like i should let you know. Jill is stood outside holding a dog doing no work at all.  As which point i walked over to her  i said  No  its my dog  Jill always does this for me  heck she has even been rewarded for it  to which i was blanked  and after the call she young girl just walked away.  This has left me feeling very angry. Why would she phone the store manager to snitch about a member of staff when she could of just asked Jill what she was doing? Why did she not open a normal till? Why did she totally blank me and walk off?  I used to work as a CTS at Sainsbury s  before being promoted to a night manager & i would NEVER expect one of my staff to of done that. it s important to trust the people you work with. How can Jill trust her when she is running to the manager instead of just asking Jill what she was doing?  I really do hope Jill does not get into trouble  and she gets to keep her reward. The store was Leeds Headingley.;2016-06-13T07:22:11+0000;10154914464689377_10154914508089377;pageowner;0;I'm really sorry Lee.

Our buying team have advised us that there has been no change in relation to the breed, feed or growing conditions for any of our whole birds that we sell in-store however they did advise that as it is a natural product there may be some variation between samples. While this could be part of the reason, any variation in cooking conditions can also affect the succulence of the product, in turn this can affect the flavour. I hope this helps. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask! Ryan.;2016-06-14T10:51:03+0000;1

To cut a long story short  it wasn t the easiest of transactions to carry out as my returned phone refused to wipe my details off it.

By shopping with them you're helping support the trade in animal products, or are you still in the transitioning phase of becoming a fully fledged vegan?  You should shop in 100% vegan establishments.  Also, Facebook is run by a high percentage of people who eat meat and use animal-based products.  By using Facebook you are helping to support their ability to buy and consume animal products.  Best stay off FB to stay true to the vegan life choice.;2016-06-12T20:24:09+0000;4

One selfish motorist taking up two petrol places so I go to one that says it has a long hose  undo petrol cap and put the hose into the tank and pull the trigger. It clicks and clicks again  as if it is full but I know it is only a quarter full  so I take finger off trigger and take it out of tank. Petrol gushes out of the hose  hitting the car and back out all over my face  clothes  new suede bag  shoes and floor! I quickly put it back into tank  wait  pull trigger again and just click click. I leave hose in tank opening and walk into shop and asks that someone come out and help. So  this young attendant does and she takes over the hose but is not much more successful. She then says I am too far away from the petrol pump! I am one foot away - I point this out. She then says it is because my car is too long (!) - then  she says was my tank empty - no I say a quarter full...that s the trouble she says  when it is a quarter full! I tell her I always come to Sainsbury s at the same time every Saturday with a quarter full tank and put £20 worth of petrol in and this has not happened before  so I don t buy that excuse either.. She then tells me that she has gone over the £20....click click clicking away. We go into the petrol shop and (a) she does not apologise on behalf of Sainsbury s; (b) does not offer anything to wipe my face  bag  shoes  trousers and top with - I am dripping in petrol. I then get charged for the petrol that has gone all over me and the floor!! I tell her I have now got to go and meet my daughter in the Vintage Centre for a look round and then go shopping...absolutely no word of apology!! I ask if it was because of an air lock in the petrol pump and she says  brazen as anything   probably !! Sainsbury s - my next message is going to you!  Shoppers in the Vintage Centre all keeping their  distance from smelly old me  so after a quick look round  I go home to have a shower.

We don't update our website with stock availability, I'm afraid. When you place your order, the pickers will collect the items you've ordered to be added to your delivery on the day it's going out. This means that, although we will stock certain items, and those items will appear on our website, there's a chance they will be unavailable by the time the pickers are collecting your order. The subs are at the discretion of the pickers, as I'm sure you can appreciate they have a very busy job trying to collect all of the items, and might not have the time to look through individual order histories. Sorry for the inconvenience. Daryl.;2016-06-11T13:24:33+0000;1

I said no and waited 2 weeks for a response before emailing my complaint in. 4 weeks later and guess what - still no response. I ordered my shopping online  you delivered the wrong stuff due to a glitch on your website - charged me for it and refused to take it back. Not a word in response from you... Disgusting  and really surprised because normally your customer service is good.;2016-06-11T11:29:28+0000;10154908797419377_10154908854129377;381d0a58d207c1ec630a0d575c6abfa213cff80e;0;Thanks.

Right now I am going to call the Police (Action Fraud)  under data protection I will be requesting a copy of all the calls we made  as well as the Information Commissioner regarding your handling of our data.  We are currently awaiting a call from you  but I don t hold out much hope.

The level of incompetence has become too much. I will be documenting this misery on a website, and will then be looking to make sure that other consumers are aware of your handling of your online customers, especially those who have been a victim of a crime and when looking to you for support get fobbed off.

Also as previously mentioned the account details were changed (see the original reason for initially contacting you) so those details don't match, which was confirmed when we called to investigate.  I have lost absolute faith in Sainsbury's, and will be taking the action previously mentioned.  However the fact I have asked for your DPO details three times over my previous replies and none of the people representing Sainsbury's have given that information only emphasises the complete lack of customer service.  That coupled with the fact no one has bothered to reply directly to my PM, instead replying in an open discussion further enforces the lack of respect and care for your customers.

It s my friends daughters party tomorrow and as my own daughter has allergies my friend always makes a special trip to Sainsburys to buy a safe cake so that my daughter is included in the celebrations.  There were no pink castle cakes on the shelf and no label either. We spoke to a staff member who told us that it s not being stocked anymore because the summer range has been brought in so the castle cake has been replaced by a pink rose (which is not nut allergy friendly I hasten to add). There are now no nut safe pink girly cakes in store and we are hugely disappointed :-( Is this a permanent move?;2016-06-10T12:31:03+0000;10154905902914377_10154905981569377;pageowner;0;Hi Liisa, that's ashame.

No e mail to myself whatsoever to state if there were any substitutions - (there were) or whether the driver would be on time etc.  I would have expected this being a new customer.  The driver did not even realise that I was a new customer.  What I will say is that the shopping was bang on time and the driver was lovely very friendly.  An asset to your company. I normally use Ocado who I find are more organised and informative sending substitutions etc via e mail and reminders that they are coming.

I suffer of endometriosis and fibroids hence I need to eat oranic produces. Since I started eating organic I have seen all the gradual improvements in my health.

My little boy is two and has been using your nappies since he was 6 months old and we ve had no problems. I noticed today when putting a nappy on him that the design had changed and every nappy he has worn today has leaked through!! Highly disappointed and now I have a whole pack of nappies that I do not want to use. I look forward to hearing your response.

Yesterday  I was SLOWLY pulling out of my parking space  when another car came racing up from my left. I had to turn the wheel sharply to the right to avoid it...and VERY SLOWLY (my foot was still on the clutch) dinked the bollard. The bollard is designed to cause maximum car damage - it dented not only the door but (more expensively) the sill underneath as well. I have received quotations of around £700 + VAT to mend my car. I understand that these bollards are to stop people parking on pedestrian walkways  but can they not be made of heavy-duty rubber or some similarly  soft  material? Failing that  can they not be re-designed NOT to crunch up car sills? I ve been shopping at this store for years - but now I m going to Morrissons instead where they manage to survive without bollards.;2016-06-08T14:38:36+0000;10154899798169377_10154899941549377;pageowner;0;Hi Merryn, sorry your car has been damaged.

I drove to this store to by part of my monthly shopping  this is something I have done for a number of years. Silly me did not have a pound coin in my pocket for the trolly. No problem I thought I will go into the shop to exchange a five-pound note for pound coins. To my shock   and amazement I was told by the member of staff they could not do this. I explained that I wanted to do my shopping and I did have my shopping bags in my hand  still I was informed that this exchange could not take place.

Yes we have recently improved the recipe of our ISB scones making them larger, increasing the amount of fruit in the Cherry and Sultana scones and making the in store processing easier to ensure consistency. The old product came in as a frozen scone puck that was baked off in store and the new product comes in full finished. We previously had issues with the quality of the baked off product where stores would defrost the puck resulting in very poor product. We customer panel all products before making any changes and all three new variants were preferred over the old product.  I hope this information is helpful to you. Steven;2016-06-09T10:56:15+0000;1

Put the required amount of goods in my trolley and when I went to checkout realised the voucher is actually missing the code to input for the offer  Ended up walking a couple of miles to my local store to get a few essentials and enquire about this to be told to call a number to get it sorted which they did give me  so several hours after trying to buy online with this code I get told it will be by 8pm tomorrow that you will be able to email me a new code to use to get this offer  this is completely useless for me as this was shopping for a festival and I needed it delivered Tues Night or collect by 8am Wednesday (staff in store told me they are open from 7am and wouldn t be a problem) Now When i go online to check times for click and collect the earliest you do is 8.30am which is after my train leaves. As such now I will be unable to use this voucher as noone seems to be able to find a way around it and will have to hope that I can buy what I need before 8am on wednesday with no discounts (is alcohol available to sell before 8am?)

This made me smile. 2ndly when serving me and my partner  Collin just had a way about him that really made me leave feeling happy and well served  I can t even explain what this man did  I just know that everyone who is served by Collin will leave feeling good and with a smile. I just wanted to let you know all this and see if their was a way you could let Collin know that he made a usually grumpy  and unsociable person like myself smile for no other reason than I was served by him.;2016-06-06T19:36:50+0000;10154894273104377_10154894328824377;pageowner;0;This is lovely feedback James, I'm really pleased my colleague Colin could help!

Picked up a mug off a hook which caught the mug on the hook above  sending it flying as it was so full. Retrieved the pieces off the floor and took to customer services  offering to pay for the breakage - cut myself in the process. Asked for a plaster but staff member couldn t find one so carried on with my shopping as it only looked a small nick. Looked down two minutes later to see blood everywhere - went to the pharmacy to ask for a plaster but told there was no first aid box  eventually handed a  piece of paper towel. Is it not standard procedure to have a first aid box for staff and customers in each department? It certainly was when I worked for one of your rival supermarkets a fair few years ago! Not to mention unhygienic to let a customer wander around with a laceration. Needless to say I left promptly but surprised at the apathetic attitude of your staff.;2016-06-06T19:36:27+0000;10154894271899377_10154894328659377;pageowner;0;Oh no, really sorry Georgie!

We received  a phone call this morning saying you were having a few problems at your warehouse and our delivery would be 2 hours late. Inconvenient but I can cope with that. What I can t deal with is when my shopping arrives with no fruit/ veg  no household  no pet food  as well as a number of other items and a very stressed out driver who has no paperwork and can t even take back unwanted substitutes. Yep even the few items we did receive had 4 that were not what I ordered!! This is not convenient I don t order my shopping online to have to go food shopping anyway as you can t even manage to fulfil basic items on an order.

Did not think this was the norm and we buy and freeze bread and rolls at times. Would be good to hear officially if this is Ok to refreeze. I would guess bread is low risk anyway. Would refreezing make the bread more dry second time around as we have had bread come out of the freezer dry at times (excluding freezer burn).  Cheers;2016-06-06T17:53:52+0000;0

We have a range of items which come into store prebaked, and a large selection which are baked fresh in the store. Our prebaked brioche buns come frozen to preserve their freshness, and will usually be fully defrosted and put out for sale, which in this case they weren't quite ready! My colleague in the bakery checked the packaging and advised that they state 'previously frozen' however if you choose to freeze them this would be at your own discretion. If you've any questions regarding this next time you're in store, feel free to ask one of our bakery colleagues for some help and they'll be happy to oblige. Ryan.;2016-06-06T18:11:06+0000;0

No problem with this as I was still home to receive it  and I opened the door with a huge smile of relief at receiving todays lunch and dinner. My problem is of all the things delivered was merely the  junk  No milk  meat  sandwich fillers  cheese  frozen stuff or vegetables. I m to feed 7 people tonight on junk or bread and water. I ve no bill to indicate how much I ve been charged. I ve had wrong stuff delivered which are not cost effective (small pack wipes and wrong flavoured food)   and well yes I could live with all this ordinarily as it really doesn t make life hard just more expensive.. EXCEPT I am on a training course tonight  and now have no time to get out and get any food to feed the 7 of us between now and later. It s going to cost me a whole lot more money to get a takeaway in  and then I ve got to reorder almost my entire shopping list!

Providing this was when the Nectar helpline were open, you should have been offered the opportunity to carry out a Nectar workaround. Your Nectar card will be registered to one particular 'home' store, this is to prevent fraud. If you visit another store, a colleague should have you phone Nectar, to answer some security questions, you should then be able to spend your points immediately. Thanks, Naomi.;2016-06-06T10:39:13+0000;0

Here are some:  You are not voting to leave the EEA or WTO  meaning all of the UK s trade and benefit agreements will remain unchanged should we leave  until such a time that the UK decides to renegotiate them for any reason.  You are not voting to leave NATO  meaning our security agreements remain unchanged. Should we receive an act of hostility from a non-NATO member  then NATO countries are obliged to come to our assistance. This does not change.  You are not voting to leave the UN  G8 or G20  meaning Britain will have the same voice on the world stage as it does today.  You are not voting to leave Europe!! The UK will still  geographically  be part of Europe. Non political organisations aligned to Europe will still extend membership to the UK (I.e. sports governing bodies  and so on).  You are not voting to stop recognising Interpol  Europol and neither are you voting for SIS / MI6 to stop dealing with other intelligence services in the fight against terrorism and global  organised crime.  You are not voting against being able to travel to Europe  contrary to the belief of some fools recently on TV. The UK has always maintained stricter border and passport controls than many EU members. This will not change. You will still use a passport to go on holiday and you will still be allowed entry to countries in Europe. You may even get chance to skip queues by using the non--EU queues at the airport (the only point so far that is my opinion  and not necessarily a fact).  The UK economy will benefit to the tune of £billions in the first year after we leave.  Medical and science research will not simply stop. The UK pays into the EU to then get money back in the form of funding. The UK will now be in control of this money and can choose to fund whatever UK based medical  science  art or other research it chooses.  Farming will not lose money because of EU funding being cut. The UK negotiated a rebate of some monies that the UK pays to the EU  in order to subsidise UK farmers. Instead of asking for our money back  we can give it straight to farmers. No change there.  You are not voting against human rights. The EU Convention on  and European Court of Human Rights are not part of the EU. Until parliament passes a new bill of rights for the UK  these will still apply  as will precedents already passed down to UK courts from Brussels.  You are not voting to kick anyone out of the UK or block access to anyone. Neither are you voting to stop recruiting valuable European workers into things like the NHS. Like my other point about passports for travel  the UK is already outside of the Schengen zone and so migrant workers must enter the UK with a valid passport before and after June 23rd. That will not change. British borders maintain full control of who comes and goes. Should someone have the skills to apply to work in the NHS  then they will still be permitted travel and given an opportunity to apply for a job. Worst case  points based assessment  like the US  Canada and Australia use  will come into effect. The UK is likely to negotiate freedom of labour movement though  in exchange for freedom of goods movement.  You are not voting to move jobs nor production out of the UK! The EU actually helped fund the move of Ford Transit production from the UK to Turkey... Yes  the EU helped give UK jobs to people in Turkey by giving Ford a loan of £80m with very generous terms!  What you are voting for is UK sovereignty. You are voting to stay in or leave a political union of leaders and representatives that you British people did not elect. You are voting against a commission of unelected  elite men that nobody at all voted for and yet they make decisions on our behalf. You are simply voting to bring sovereignty back to Westminster  and that is all. If you worry about that because you don t like the Conservative government  look at the reality. Their majority in parliament is very slim. They have been blocked on big decisions already. You are therefore not giving sovereignty to David Cameron  but to the UK House of elected representatives.

Different sizes of stores have very different operational requirements and running costs, which in turn affect our product pricing.  Our local stores tend to have higher operating costs than our superstores as they’re located in more expensive locations and have longer opening hours.  In addition, factors involving staffing, local rates and focus on convenience products also contribute to the difference in product pricing. Please be reassured that despite the above, we always strive to ensure we are offering great value for money across our local stores.  We do this by monitoring our local prices weekly against our supermarkets and other competitors. Maria;2016-06-05T14:48:30+0000;0

Again, that is not what RIP off means.  Anything with the price displayed so that you know in advance what the cost will be is NOT a rip off, you are using the term totally incorrectly.

My order which was due to arrive between 10-11am cannot be delivered today. I am offered a refund but have now got to replace a huge order as I have visitors arriving today with no time to do so.  I thought a firm as large and experienced as Sainsbury s would have contingency plans in place for sick drivers or broken down vans. I have had so many bad experiences with Sainsbury s - not one of my recent orders has arrived without substitutions (annoyingly these are typically more expensive - Waitrose charge you the lower price but Sainsbury s don t).  A few years ago I was contacted on Christmas Eve to be told despite having had the order for 4 weeks  my order could not be delivered as they could not cope with demand. On that occasion following discussion with customer service someone arrived at my door with most of the order in bags from all of our local shops - an attempt to think outside the box which was appreciated despite the shambolic  poor business planning that led to it happening.  Today I was told a simple  No - we can t fulfil your order!  I will never use Sainsbury s again - Ocado  Waitrose and Morrisons manage to get their business model and professional service spot on every time. I was foolish on this occasion to be lured away from them by a good slot on Sunday morning but now regret it and will never make that mistake again.;2016-06-05T10:47:37+0000;10154890261209377_10154890449589377;pageowner;0;Hi Anne-Marie, I'm really sorry about your delivery experience with us.

You lost an order from me a couple of weeks ago due to the website being down and no doubt 1000 s of others and then when I went to amend a pending order this evening it stopped as the bank verification was going through but with no warning. Tried all the  phone numbers and was waiting for an hour before I hung up and then saw the Twitter comments. Why instruct customers to use a different line in case of problems with online orders when this was permanently engaged as well - a proper message saying the website was down would be helpful on ringing instead of the continuous message and music.

People are stating they have deliveries tomorrow, you saying maybe best to try tomorrow isn't helping.  I get there is an issue and you're working on it, I imagine everyone is doing all they can.  I work on SaaS solutions delivering a service to clients and we would never say something to annoy the customer further. Let people know you're working on it, you don't know how long it will take, and there's a possibility that no, it won't be fixed by their checkout time. That way people can actually plan how to get their groceries rather then get more annoyed and hound you further.;2016-06-03T20:53:52+0000;0

We have been able to provide this agreement as their is a health and safety requirement for the placement of the portacabin in which it needs to be a certain distances from the building works and in order to prevent trips, slips, falls or any other kind of hazards to the general public. I have been advised that one bay has been occupied by the cabin, with at least another 7 bays available for anyone who wishes to utilised the parking space. We've contacted our property team for more info on the agreement, and we'll update you here once we know more about the situtation. Ryan.;2016-06-03T10:35:18+0000;0

Not having a ""go"" at you as you have been more than helpful, but that argument made by them does not hold water... However many spaces there are is irrelevant as they could be full at any time who kows? On that argument I'd I went into Sainsbury's and found that it was either too difficult or the Gents were full I am free to wander into the Ladies loo to use the facility - of course I'm not. Whatever their argument they are morally in the wrong and suggesting to all that the disabled are a secondary consideration (which is somewhat illegal), and is also letting their potential members know that they too can park there when the gym opens, especially at night as it is universally known the disabled people are never out after dark are they? (Your car park suffers from thus too). Sorry but H&S doesn't come into it... They are in the wrong and whoever instructed them is way off the mark.;2016-06-03T10:42:48+0000;0

Anytime Fitness are set to open a new gym on the 30 June. We agreed with them that they could temporarily use part of our car park ahead of opening, in order to sign up customers interested in joining the gym. Before we made any decision we spent time monitoring how people use the car park so we could site the cabin in the best location and ensure the health and safety of all customers. This research showed that the disabled parking bays were being under-used (as the scheme is not fully let); and that the location would provide safe access for people wanting to join the gym, via the footways. This is why we have located the cabin in its current position. We do understand your concerns and will continue to monitor the situation. If we need to move the cabin to provide additional disabled parking spaces we will do so. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact our Property Communications team on propertycommunications@sainsburys.co.uk. Faiza.";2016-06-09T15:46:06+0000;0

When you have folks extorting it on the grounds of "" customer service/loyalty"" on social media every second of the day, day in day out...its understandable that it soon runs out. Ive just read a post from a lady who is 'trying it on' with another store on their facebook page....shes been refunded in full for some alleged bad fish, with an extra pound or two ' goodwill apology' added and she is complaining it isn't enough!...greed has whittled away any goodwill stores may have had.;2016-06-02T13:55:56+0000;3

Feel out of pocket and conned!!!!!!!;2016-06-01T20:18:43+0000;10154880490449377_10154882107489377;eafcf1995789556c1987e3d43267e17fd93f887f;0;You should of refused the whole order....;2016-06-02T11:27:33+0000;0

Anyway thought it was good offer - signed up as newby  added the 6 bottles of prosecco then added double the normal amount of toilet rolls and bleach to get the order to the £100!! Processed the order no problem.   Day before the delivery decided to add something on - problem wouldnt let me check out again so called your customer services -  oh yes if its the prosecco it was a mistake you cant actually have both offers so you couldnt have the 25% off the £7.50 bottlles!!! Hmmm ok well it let me the first time!   No the driver would have told you when he turned up!!  Why dont you try a different prosecco on the 25% off offer?    - Ok so i picked another one and to make the order up to the 100 again as it was less i ordered 12 bottles this time (Im not an alcoholic summers coming!)  Ok she said  the only thing is im not sure the £20 off new customer offer applies if the order includes alcohol!!!!   Really?? Anyway couldnt find anywhere in the small print it didnt so we went ahead and processed the order this time without problem but with a different prosecco! So tonight the delivery turns up -   Oh theres a change on there he says  -  You ordered 12 x bottles - they only sent 2 (obviously back to the full price as 25% off only applies to 6)  - there were no alternatives so none of the wine on the 25% off was available then?

You have decided to rebrand it as  all butter  now containing milk and so my son cannot eat this  I m really disappointed and thought it was a fantastic product that did not need milk adding.;2016-06-01T16:10:41+0000;10154879881059377_10154879972604377;a3ae911fcc5cc7a202b53806f103d01d7be09baa;0;That's good news Karen Campbell and we'll done sainsbury for dealing with the matter, happy days xxx;2016-06-01T16:58:21+0000;1
